    "description": "BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS:\n\nAdvancements in neoadjuvant systemic treatments (NST) for HER2 positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (BC) subtypes have led to high rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), raising questions about the necessity of subsequent surgery, especially for those undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains the most effective imaging technique for assessing neoadjuvant treatment response, surgery is still required to confirm pCR in cases of almost complete or complete MRI response (iCR). To safely avoid surgery in these BC \"exceptional responders,\" a technique with high negative predictive value is imperative.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThis study aims to establish the diagnostic efficacy of image-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) in assessing pathological complete response (pCR) after NST in HER2 positive or TN breast cancer subtypes, particularly those showing post NST-MRI complete or almost complete response.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nA prospective study was conducted at \"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre de Madrid\" from June 25, 2018, to October 25, 2029. Twenty-five patients with HER2-positive or TN operable invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) BC subtype, at stages cT1-3/N0-2 undergoing primary NST and showing complete or almost complete response on post NST-MRI, were enrolled. Ultrasound or stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) of the previous clip and tumor bed area was performed before surgery. VAB pathological results were compared with surgical pathological results to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of predicting pCR with VAB after NST. Pathological representativeness of the VAB sample was ensured. pCR was defined as the absence of invasive ductal carcinoma and in situ ductal carcinoma.",

    "description": "Patients with metastatic breast cancer may respond well to treatment and metastases can remain stable for several years. Despite personalised medicine being increasingly used for diagnosis and treatment, follow-up still include radiological response evaluation every 3-4 months, which renders a significant number of 'unnecessary' exams for patients with long-term stable disease. Increasing evidence indicates that tumour markers such as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) may be useful for disease monitoring in the metastatic setting. However, algorithms that accurately define the time-points at which imaging can be foregone or reinstituted when progression is forecast, have not been developed. This study will measure ctDNA, TK1 and CA15-3 at all imaging time-points. The primary aim is to develop an algorithm based on these biomarkers, alone or in combination, that with sufficient specificity and sensitivity can advise whether a scan can be safely admitted at a specific time-point, for patients with MBC receiving first line therapy with AI plus cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i). Additional samples will be stored such that novel biomarkers can also be tested in future. The cost-effectiveness of using the devised biomarker protocol will be evaluated.",

Radiation therapy is considered an integral part of breast conserving therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day. This has been shown to be an effective treatment for breast cancer while reducing treatment time and decreasing side effects. Preoperative radiotherapy alone or concurrently with chemotherapy has also been tested with excellent results and with minimal toxicity. Preoperative radiation of the intact tumor with a hypofractionated regimen can potentially decrease toxicity by allowing the delivery of treatment to intact breast tissue. The potential advantages of preoperative radiation therapy include the delivery of radiation in the intact breast when radiation can be more effective as more oxygen can be available in the tissue. Furthermore, complications and cosmetic results are expected to be lower in pre-operative radiotherapy before surgery, as there have been no changes in blood supply to the breast. This lends to the possibility of using lower doses of radiotherapy to patients, and potentially better cancer associated clinical outcomes for our breast cancer patients. Undergoing hypofractionated radiation therapy before or after breast surgery may be safe and effective in treating patients with different types of non-metastatic breast cancer.",

    "description": "The incidence of brain metastases (BM) in metastatic breast cancer is increasing, due to the improvement in the control of systemic disease, and due to an improved detection through imagery.\n\nThe treatment management of single BM remains controversial. Indeed, even though it is widely accepted that local treatment increases the median survival time in patients having a good prognostic status, the adding of \"adjuvant\" whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is currently subject to controversy, due to its potential toxicity. Yet, two randomized trials have demonstrated a clear increase in intra-cerebral recurrence and in death from neurologic origin in case of absence of \"adjuvant\" WBRT, without change in overall survival (but overall survival was not a primary endpoint in any of these studies).\n\nThe data from literature on cognitive toxicity (CT) of WBRT on BM are scarce and sometimes controversial. CT of WBRT affects the subcortical frontal functions. It is postulated that the alteration of hippocampal neurogenesis (mainly due to inflammation process), situated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, has an essential role in the development of these brain dysfunctions.\n\nIt has been shown that the incidence of BM in the hippocampal region (hippocampus + 5mm expansion) is low, in the range of 8,6%.\n\nNew irradiation techniques, in particular intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with rotational radiotherapy, allow to modulate the dose on an intra-cerebral structure, all the while distributing an adapted dose to the remaining brain.\n\nThis prospective, randomized study, will compare, through a battery of neuropsychological tests, the cognitive impact of WBRT of 40 Gy in 20 fractions with or without hippocampal avoidance by intensity modulated radiotherapy, in patients presenting with a single operated brain metastasis of breast cancer. If the hippocampal avoidance leads to a significant improvement in cognitive function, this radiotherapy scheme could become the standard postoperative treatment to be proposed to patients presenting the best prognostic factors. This would allow to prevent long-term cognitive deficit, while preserving WBRT benefit on intra-cerebral control.\n\nJustification of evaluation criteria :\n\nPrincipal criteria :\n\nEvaluation criteria to assess cognitive toxicity have been selected on the basis of the recommendations from C. Meyers and P. Brown, who propose an adapted test battery to evaluate memory, verbal function, visual and motor coordination, and executive function. The selected tests have been validated, also in French. They comprise HVLT-R (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised), COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test), Grooved Pegboard test, TMT A and B (Trailmaking tests A and B), and MMSE. The calculation of patient numbers was based on the HVLT-R test, as memory is thought to be the most frequently affected domain.\n\nThe tests will be performed before treatment (\"baseline\" cognitive function), at 4 months and at 12 months. In case of a missing answer to the evaluation tests, the reason(s) for not answering will be noted.\n\nSecondary criteria :\n\nQuality of life : QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20, ADL, IADL Intra-cerebral Progression-free survival (PFS) Overall survival.",

    "description": "Improvement in bleeding and bruising has been described by using both intravenous and topical off-label applications of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in many surgical fields. This trial tests how well applying tranexamic acid (TXA) to the surface of the surgical site (topically) works to reduce post-operative bleeding (hematomas) and fluid collections (seromas) in women undergoing surgery to remove both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) immediately followed by surgery to rebuild the breast (reconstruction). The formation of hematomas and seromas, a common post-mastectomy complication, can interfere with breast reconstruction and increase the risk of infection and wound healing and can potentially delay cancer treatments. TXA is a synthetic molecule that pushes the body's clotting cascade toward clot formation to improve blood clotting. Applying TXA topically to the surgical site before closing the incision may prevent hematoma and seroma formation in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction patients.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from patients undergoing bilateral mastectomy at University of California, San Francisco.",

    "official_title": "Side by Side - Prediction of Couples' Adjustment to Breast or Gynecological Cancer",
    "description": "The diagnosis and treatment of cancer leads to emotional distress, and major disruptions in role functioning. Traditionally, psychosocial services offer individuals diagnosed with cancer peer group support or individual counseling with only few consideration of type or stage of cancer. Besides most cancers significantly impacting not only the individual but also their partners and families, breast and gynecological cancer may be particularly embedded in an interpersonal context, namely in the couple's relationship. Breast and gynecological cancer cause additional concerns about the women' body image, sexual functioning and these cancers may be prone to provoke or enhance maladaptive patterns of interaction between women and their partners. Thus, not only the individual but also the couple's functioning is threatened by these diagnoses.\n\nThe aim of the here proposed study is to identify predictors of couple's adjustment and to help couples to improve their ability to support each other during this time. In a multi-site study, we will evaluate the efficacy of a couple-based intervention entitled \"Side by Side: Coping with Cancer Together (\"Seite an Seite: Krebs Gemeinsam Bew\u00e4ltigen\"). The intervention teaches couples relationship skills that have been repeatedly validated within the marital field. The aim of the intervention is to improve couples' skills to talk to each other effectively about cancer-related topics, and enhance (or maintain) an affectionate relationship in the face of death.\n\nWe will randomly assign 303 women recently diagnosed with either breast or gynecological cancer and their partners to one of two conditions: (1) Seite an Seite, or (2) Treatment-As-Usual, in which couples receive no active psychosocial intervention. Assessment will be conducted pre-, post-, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. These assessments include for both partners negative and positive self-report measures of individual functioning (such as mood, anxiety and benefit finding) and relationship functioning (such as relationship distress, communication patterns). Furthermore, at pre-, post- and 12-month Follow-up observational data on mutual supportive behavior when communicating about a cancer-related topic will be collected. The study may enhance our understanding of the significance of relationship skills in the process of adjusting to cancer as a couple and as an individual.",

    "description": "A pilot study of adult (\u2265 18 years) women with stage II-III breast cancer who will receive preoperative chemotherapy prior to mastectomy. Patients will have real-time serum glycan profiling, expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response and additional mammography and HD PET/CT examinations to assess response. The investigators hypothesize that a functional tumor assessment utilizing high-definition positron emission tomography/computed tomography (HD PET/CT), real-time serum glycan profiling, and expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms will predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients.",
