    "title": "Melatonin enhances everolimus efficacy in breast cancer by suppressing mTOR pathway activation and promoting apoptosis and mitochondrial function.",
    "abstract": "Everolimus is used in the treatment of breast cancer by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly during anti-hormonal therapy. The efficacy of everolimus is limited due to a feedback loop that supresses mTOR while simultaneously enhancing Akt activation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) regulates mitochondrial activity, cell death, and autophagy due to its strong free radical scavenging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Melatonin, a naturally occurring oncostatic agent, slows tumor growth in a range of malignancies, including breast cancer. Due to its ability to protect healthy cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, along with its anti-cancer properties, melatonin has the potential to serve asan effective adjuvant in breast cancer therapy. It also inhibits the phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, two essential pathways implicated in breast cancer growth, which may aid in overcoming resistance to targeted treatments like everolimus. The combination effects of melatonin and everolimus on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer remains unexplored. This study examined the effectiveness of melatonin when combined with everolimus for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. To investigate the effects of melatonin and everolimus combination, we divided MCF-7 cells into four experimental groups: the control, Melatonin (3 mM), Everolimus (30 nM), and a combination of Melatonin and Everolimus (3 mM\u2009+\u200930 nM). Cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy activation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated using established techniques. Based on the cell viability test, the combination of 30 nM everolimus and 3 mM melatonin inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, which are downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, and reduced cell growth. In addition, co-administration of melatonin and everolimus increased apoptosis and led to Sub-G1 phase accumulation. LC3 protein expression and LC3 puncta analysis demonstrated autophagic activity. In terms of mitochondrial function, co-administration of melatonin with everolimus did not cause proton leakage or mitochondrial uncoupling, but did restore everolimus-induced respiratory inhibition. In conclusion, melatonin is thought to improve the effectiveness of everolimus by inhibiting mTOR downstream effectors, enhancing apoptosis, activating autophagy, improving mitochondrial respiration, and reducing MCF-7 growth.",

    "title": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPRK) revisited: evolving insights into structure, function, and pathology.",
    "abstract": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Kappa (PTPRK) is a membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the frequently deleted region of chromosome 6q, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Structurally, PTPRK comprises with an extracellular domain involved in cell-cell adhesion, a transmembrane region, and two intracellular catalytic domains responsible for its phosphatase activity. Notably, PTPRK undergoes proteolytic cleavage by Furin and ADAM10, resulting in the generation of an extracellular E-subunit and a P-subunit. Further processing by \u03b3-secretase releases the intracellular PIC, which plays a pivotal role in regulating \u03b2-catenin signaling within the nucleus. PTPRK is widely recognized for its tumor-suppressive properties across various cancers, including colorectal, lung, ovarian, and melanoma. Despite its function as a tumor suppressor, the expression and activity of PTPRK exhibit considerable variability across different cancer types and stages. It exerts its effects by dephosphorylating key signaling molecules such as EGFR, STAT3, CD133 and \u03b2-catenin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Beyond its role in cancer, PTPRK is also involved in immune regulation, particularly in the development of CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In the nervous system, PTPRK is linked to neurite outgrowth and synaptic transmission, with genetic polymorphisms in PTPRK associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Given its extensive involvement in cancer biology, immune regulation, and neurodevelopment, PTPRK presents a promising therapeutic target. Strategies aimed at restoring its activity or targeting PTPRK might offer new approaches for current cancer therapies and overcome drug resistance. In this review, we elucidate the structural characteristics and functional roles of PTPRK in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis. The variability of PTPRK suggests that the regulatory mechanisms governing its activity are intricate and worth further comprehensive investigation.",

    "title": "Unlocking the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced cervical cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in treating advanced cervical cancer, emphasizing their potential as transformative therapeutic options in this complex clinical landscape. EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched for articles on the outcomes of ICIs in advanced cervical cancer patients. A pooled analysis was performed to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR: reported as an odds ratio (OR), progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR), overall survival (OS; HR), and safety outcomes risk ratio (RR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted to identify potential sources of bias and heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis included 5 studies involving 3,112 patients. Compared with standard therapies, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR; OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.27-2.23), prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; HR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.65-0.80), and extended overall survival (OS; HR\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.61-0.79). Subgroup analyses revealed potential predictors of treatment response. Moreover, ICIs exhibit a manageable safety profile, with adverse events consistent with known immune-related toxicities. This meta-analysis highlights the promising efficacy and favourable safety profile of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced cervical cancer. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, with ICIs emerging as a potential cornerstone therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate optimal patient selection, combination therapies, and long-term outcomes. This study provides valuable insights for clinicians and researchers, paving the way for personalized and effective treatment approaches for advanced cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "To describe characteristics, management, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at high risk of recurrence (MIBC-HR) undergoing radical cystectomy in France and a subgroup of these patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after RC and were managed with active surveillance only (MIBC-HR-ASO). Patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200918 years with MIBC who had radical cystectomy from October 2012 to June 2018 were identified in the prospective COBLAnCE bladder cancer cohort. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. Patients were classified as MIBC-HR based on TNM staging. Disease-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 256 patients with MIBC-HR were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years and 204 patients were men (79.7%). 201 patients (78.5%) were current or former smokers. For staging, 226 patients were (y)pT3a or higher (88.3%) and 132 were N- (51.6%). Forty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.0%), and 69 received adjuvant chemotherapy (27.0%). Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy only, 59 received cisplatin-based therapy (86.8%). 182 patients (71.1%) constituted the ASO subgroup. 175 patients (68.3%) experienced an event up to the end of follow-up. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Median disease-free survival was 1.30 years [95%CI: 1.01-1.60] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 1.21 years [95%CI: 0.70-1.53] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. Median overall survival was 2.31 years [95%CI: 1.85-3.10] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 2.11 years [95%CI: 1.61-2.65] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. At 5 years, DFS was 27.4% [21.7;33.9%] in the MIBC-HR population and 23.7% [17.4;31.4] in the MIBC-HR-ASO population. OS at five years was 33.2% [27.1;40.0] for the MIBC-HR population and 29.6% [22.7;37.7] for the MIBC-HR-ASO population. Using real-world data, this study underscores the challenging prognosis of patients with MIBC-HR managed with RC, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy. New treatment protocols, such as the use of immunotherapies, may improve OS in this type of cancer, especially in the current therapeutic landscape where no highly effective treatment exists.",

    "abstract": "Cuproptosis, a novel form of regulatory cell death, was investigated in this study for its effects on cuproptosis-associated proteins during gliomas development, offering novel insights into the mechanism of copper ion-based antitumor drugs. In the present study, bioinformatics and cellular experiments were employed to investigate cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in glioma, with a specific focus on SLC31A1. The study findings indicated that many CRGs (SLC31A1, FDX1, DLST, LIPT1, LIPT2, DLD, NFE2L2, ATP7A, DLAT, GCSH, and ATP7B) were differentially expressed between glioma and non-tumor groups. These genes potentially influence glioma initiation and progression by modulating associated signaling pathways, including those involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, and the tumor microenvironment. Survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression model demonstrated that individuals classified as high-risk exhibited poorer prognosis, suggesting that CRGs possess prognostic capabilities. The assessment of tumor mutational burden indicated that CRGs could serve as biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma. Further functional analysis of SLC31A1 showed that its elevation was associated with increased glioma cell malignancy, promoting proliferation and migration. Additionally, treatment with the mitotic inhibitor MP-HJ-1b markedly suppressed SLC31A1 expression, consequently inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and migration. Extensive data analysis indicated that CRGs hold promise as both prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for glioma.",

However, the pharmacological targets and mechanism by which EGCG can combat NPC patients remain to be studied in detail. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying EGCG's therapeutic effects on NPC, with an emphasis on developing a prognostic risk model and identifying potential therapeutic targets. A novel prognostic risk model was developed using univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression and multivariable Cox regression analyses, incorporating six genes to stratify patients into low- and highrisk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival in the high-risk group. The model's accuracy was further validated using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ESTIMATE analysis revealed significantly higher immune, stromal and overall ESTIMATE scores in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Immune profiling indicated significant differences in five immune cell subtypes (memory B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), gamma delta T cells, activated NK cells and activated dendritic cells) between the two risk groups. Additionally, the low-risk group showed greater sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemistry and molecular docking analyses identified CYCS and MYL12B as promising targets for EGCG treatment. This study utilised network pharmacology and bioinformatics to identify shared genes between EGCG and NPC, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which EGCG inhibits NPC and to develop a prognostic model for assessing patient outcomes. The findings provide potential insights for the development of anti-NPC therapies and their clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer therapies have transformed the landscape of cancer treatments but are often associated with off-target adverse drug reactions due to overlapping molecular pathways in healthy tissues, including those in the eye. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), expressed across various parts of the eye, can become unintended targets of FGFR inhibitors such as erdafitinib, infigratinib, and pemigatinib, leading to ocular adverse events (AEs) affecting the ocular surface and retina. AEs across clinical trials are graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which may not completely capture the ocular sequelae resulting from the use of emerging therapies. As CTCAE grading is mainly through the description of symptoms and their impact on visual acuity, it is imperative to use a tool that relies more on objective findings from ophthalmologic evaluations. The novel ocular adverse reaction severity grading scale developed by Amgen in collaboration with expert ophthalmologists, accounts for the anatomical regions impacted by ocular adverse reactions and anchors each severity grade to objective observable criteria from ophthalmologic evaluations. This grading scale is being used across the clinical development program for bemarituzumab to precisely characterize the ocular safety profile, enabling cross-specialty collaboration between oncologists and eye care providers to implement appropriate management strategies. This commentary article highlights the efforts led by Amgen in collaboration with regulatory, medical, and academic fields to develop tools that facilitate early recognition of adverse reactions and appropriate interventions for patient care.",

M2 TAMs promote angiogenesis, suppress immune responses, and facilitate metastasis, thereby creating a tumor-supporting microenvironment. A range of antitumor drugs, including 5-FU, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, are mediated by M2 exosomes, each with distinct mechanisms of action. M2 exosomes transfer drug resistance capabilities via extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes containing miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. These exosome mediate the development of tumor drug resistance by regulating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin M2 exosomes can regulate cellular responses by delivering bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and ncRNA, which can also modulate cellular reactions to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting M2 TAMs and their exosome-mediated ncRNAs may offer new strategies to overcome drug resistance in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating robust prognostic models and personalized therapeutic strategies. This study integrated bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics to construct a prognostic model based on genes shared between ferroptosis and fatty acid metabolism (FAM). Using the TCGA-PRAD dataset, we identified 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the intersection of ferroptosis and FAM, of which 19 were significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS). A machine learning-based prognostic model, optimized using the Lasso\u2009+\u2009Random Survival Forest (RSF) algorithm, achieved a high C-index of 0.876 and demonstrated strong predictive accuracy (1-, 2-, and 3-year AUCs: 0.77, 0.75, and 0.78, respectively). The model, validated in the DFKZ cohort, stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting worse PFS and higher tumor mutation burden (TMB). Functional enrichment analysis revealed distinct pathway activities, with high-risk patients showing enrichment in immune-related and proliferative pathways, while low-risk patients were enriched in metabolic pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed heightened immune activity in high-risk patients, characterized by increased infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages, alongside elevated TIDE scores, suggesting immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. In contrast, low-risk patients exhibited higher infiltration of plasma cells and neutrophils and demonstrated better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq further elucidated the spatial distribution of model genes, highlighting the central role of macrophages in mediating risk stratification. Additionally, chemotherapy sensitivity analysis identified potential therapeutic agents, such as Erlotinib and Picolinic acid, for low-risk patients. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of CD38 in the PC-3 cell line led to elevated lipid peroxidation (C11-BODIPY) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting increased cell ferroptosis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for risk stratification and personalized treatment in PCa, bridging molecular mechanisms with clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have uncovered evidences for pro-tumorigenic activities attributed to IL-11, prompting a renewed focus on therapeutic strategies targeting IL-11 signaling for anti-tumor treatment. Here, we introduce 9MW3811, a monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize IL-11 effectively. By disrupting the IL-11/IL-11R\u03b1/gp130 complex, 9MW3811 inhibits JAK/STAT3 signaling, significantly reducing tumor growth in diverse mouse models. More importantly, 9MW3811 synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy, even in PD-1 non-responsive models like CT26. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that 9MW3811 remodels the tumor microenvironment by enhancing CD8+\u2009T cell infiltration and reversing T cell exhaustion via upregulated XCL1 and downregulated CCL7, boosting anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 9MW3811 counteracts PD-1-induced T cell exhaustion, with anti-PD-1 antibodies effectively mitigating PD-1 upregulation post-9MW3811 treatment. These compelling findings support ongoing clinical trials of 9MW3811, aiming to translate these preclinical insights into therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "During translation initiation, eIF1A binds the ribosome through its N- and C-terminal tails, but the functional importance of this temporal interaction in mammalian cells is lacking. Using a high-throughput drug screen targeting eIF1A-RPS10 interaction, we identified inhibitors (1Ais) for eIF1A, RPS10, or both. Applying 1Ais in biochemical assays along specific and global translation experiments, we confirmed known functions of eIF1A and uncovered new roles for both eIF1A and RPS10. Specifically, the eIF1A N-terminal tail (NTT) binding inhibitors revealed the requirement of eIF1A for translation re-initiation. Moreover, a cytosine at position +5 relative to the start codon AUG, located near eIF1A-NTT in the 48S structure, enhances sensitivity to 1Ais, suggesting that the initiating ribosome recognizes a broader AUG context than the conventional Kozak. Additionally, eIF1A-specific 1Ais predominately affect cancer-related pathways. In xenograft models of ovarian cancer, these 1Ais reduced tumor growth without apparent toxicity. Furthermore, inhibition of RPS10, but not eIF1A, modulates a context-dependent regulatory translation initiation at CUG codon of SARS-CoV-2 and impedes infection. Our study underscores 1Ais as effective means to study the role of eIF1A and RPS10 in translation and suggests their targeted inhibition as potential therapies for cancer and viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) act as guardians of the human genome, and defects in HR or MMR are causative in at least a quarter of all malignant tumors. Although these DNA repair-deficient tumors are eligible for effective targeted therapies, fully reliable diagnostic strategies based on functional assay have yet to be established, potentially limiting safe and proper application of the molecular targeted drugs. Here we show that transient transfection of artificial DNA substrates enables ultrarapid detection of HR and MMR. This finding led us to develop a diagnostic strategy that can determine the cellular HR/MMR status within one day without the need for control cells or tissues. Notably, the accuracy of this method allowed the discovery of a pathogenic RAD51D mutation, which was missed by existing companion diagnostic tests. Our methods, termed HR eye and MMR eye, are applicable to frozen tumor tissues and roughly predict the response to therapy. Overall, the findings presented here could pave the way for accurately assessing malignant tumors with functional defects in HR or MMR, a step forward in accelerating precision medicine.",

To deepen our understanding of FH-deficient RCC, we conduct a comprehensive integrated genomic study. We analyze the association of FH alteration patterns with tumor heterogeneity and develop a CpG site-specific methylation signature for precise identification of FH-deficient RCC. Transcriptomic analysis unveils three distinctive molecular subtypes characterized by enrichment of immune/Angiogenic/Stromal (C1), WNT/Notch/MAPK (C2), and proliferation/stemness (C3) pathways, respectively. Tumors in C1 derive the most substantial survival benefit from a combination of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-angiogenic therapy. Tumors in C2 display moderate response to this therapeutic approach. In contrast, tumors in C3 exhibit an unfavorable response to anti-angiogenic monotherapy and its combination with ICB. These findings contribute to a profound understanding of the aggressive nature of FH-deficient RCC, offering insights into potential precision medicine approaches for disease management.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have led to enduring responses in subsets of patients with cancer. However, these responses carry the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can diminish the overall benefit of ICI treatment. While associations between irAE development and overall survival have been increasingly documented, there is a need for further understanding of these connections in large prospective real-world cohorts. The Resistance Drivers for Immuno-Oncology Patients Interrogated by Harmonized Molecular Datasets (RADIOHEAD) study, a pan-tumor, prospective cohort of 1,070 individuals undergoing standard of care first-line ICI treatment, aims to identify factors driving irAEs and clinical response. Clinical data and longitudinal blood samples were collected prospectively at multiple time points from 49 community-based oncology clinics across the USA. Structured, harmonized clinical data underwent unbiased statistical analysis to uncover predictors of real-world overall survival (rwOS) and risk factors for irAEs. Across 1,070 participants' treatment courses, RADIOHEAD accumulated over 4,500 clinical data points. Patients experiencing any irAE (25.4%, n=272) exhibited significantly improved rwOS in the pan-tumor cohort (n=1,028, HR=0.41, 95% CI=(0.31, 0.55)). This association persisted when adjusting for age and metastatic disease in multivariate time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analysis, and was consistent across major tumor subtypes, including lung cancer and melanoma. Skin and endocrine irAEs of any grade were strongly associated with improved rwOS (Cox proportional hazard analysis, skin, p=2.03e-05; endocrine, p=0.0006). In this real-world cohort, the irAE rate appeared lower than those reported in clinical trials. Patients receiving corticosteroids prior to initiation of ICI treatment had significantly worse survival outcomes than non-users (HR 1.37, p=0.0054), with a stronger association with systemic steroid use (HR 1.75, p=0.0022). The risk of irAE was increased by exposure to combination immunotherapy relative to monotherapy (OR 4.17, p=2.8e-7), zoster vaccine (OR 2.4, p=5.2e-05), and decreased by prior chemotherapy (OR 1.69, p=0.0005). The RADIOHEAD cohort is a well-powered, real-world cohort that clearly demonstrates the association between irAE development with improved response and baseline steroid use with worse response to ICI treatment after adjustment for survival bias.",

    "abstract": "Dupilumab has been added to National Cancer Comprehensive Network guidelines as a therapeutic strategy for managing certain cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, little is known about the implications of dupilumab for cancer outcomes in this population. In this multi-institutional study, we evaluate the impact of dupilumab treatment on survival among ICB recipients. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of ICB recipients from the Mass General Brigham Healthcare System and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The dupilumab group was compared with two control groups who did not receive dupilumab: with and without cirAEs (control groups 1 and 2, respectively) that were 1:2 matched on sex, race, age at ICB initiation, Charlson Comorbidity Score, year of ICB initiation, and ICB type. Manual chart review was performed to obtain cirAE characteristics, systemic glucocorticoid use, dupilumab treatment, vital status, and last contact date. Time-varying multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to evaluate the impact of dupilumab on overall survival, adjusted for sex, race, age at ICB initiation, ICB type, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, cancer type, cancer stage at ICB initiation, and systemic glucocorticoid use. A total of 53 cirAE patients treated with dupilumab were compared with two control groups of 106 patients each. Most patients receiving dupilumab demonstrated either complete or partial resolution of their cirAE (88.7%). In multivariable modeling, the overall survival of the dupilumab group was not significantly different from control group 1 (HR=0.74, 95%\u2009CI: 0.35 to 1.60, p=0.5) or control group 2 (HR=0.70, 95%\u2009CI: 0.32 to 1.51, p=0.4). However, the use of systemic glucocorticoids within 2 years after ICB initiation was associated with poorer overall survival when comparing the dupilumab group to control group 1 (HR=2.03, 95%\u2009CI: 1.04 to 3.96, p=0.039) and control group 2 (HR=2.21, 95%\u2009CI: 1.25 to 3.91, p=0.006). This study suggests that dupilumab is an effective therapy for recalcitrant cirAEs and does not adversely impact mortality. Due to the observed detrimental effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, this study suggests the need to shift away from systemic glucocorticoid immunosuppression and toward targeted immune modulators for irAE management, though prospective randomized trials are necessary to investigate this.",

There is not yet sufficient real-world data on ROS1 diagnostic methods, treatment selection, and clinical outcomes in the Chinese population. A single-center retrospective collection of patients with a diagnosis of ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC from July 2011 to November 2021 was performed to document the method of ROS1 testing, treatment options, efficacy, and resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in these patients. The method of ROS1 testing and initial treatment selection were significantly correlated with time. ROS1 testing shifted from FISH (67% pre-2019) to NGS (96.3% post-2019; p\u2009<\u20090.001). First-line ROS1-TKI use increased from 60.0% to 92.0% (p\u2009=\u20090.041). The vast majority of patients (90.0%) chose crizotinib as the initial ROS1 inhibitor, with objective response rates (for patients with target lesions) and median progression-free survival of 82.8% (95% CI: 68.1%-97.9%) and 18.7\u2009months (95% CI: 8.9-28.4\u2009months), respectively. CNS was the most common site of progression for crizotinib (60%, 13/26, including 11 intracranial progressions alone). Compared to patients who received a chemotherapy-based regimen (n\u2009=\u20098) as first-line therapy, patients who received ROS1-TKI (n\u2009=\u200932) as first-line therapy had significantly longer median PFS (18.3\u2009months vs. 3.7\u2009months, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For ROS1 inhibitor-resistant patients, 48.3% of patients underwent rebiopsy throughout the course of their disease, with G2032R being the most common secondary ROS1 mutation (7/8). With the innovation of diagnostic and therapeutic methods and the expansion of the scope of the health insurance coverage, more and more patients are benefiting from new technologies and targeted drugs. Although crizotinib has brought excellent therapeutic data for ROS1-positive patients, better brain protection strategies should be explored for ROS1-positive patients in the future. In addition, the low rate of rebiopsy in real-world ROS1-positive patients should also be emphasized in clinical practice.",

However, the mechanism of CR treating NSCLC remains unclear. In this study, a network pharmacology-based strategy is followed to address the issue. The targets related to CR or NSCLC were obtained from multiple online public databases. Compound-target network was constructed using Cytoscape. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed by STRING. Key transcription factors were explored in TRRUST. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were accomplished in Metascape. The druglikeness of compounds was tested in Molinspiration Cheminformatics Software. Autodock Vina was used for molecular docking. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed using Gromacs. There were 104 overlapped targets considered as key targets of CR treating NSCLC. The key components of CR, including reynosin, (4S,5S)-13-hydroxygermacrone 4,5-epoxide, and (E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hepten-3-one, were screened by topological parameters and bioactivity scores. Central clustered targets in PPI network (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], SRC, JAK2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 [MAPK3]) were identified as critical therapeutic targets of CR. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that therapeutic effect of CR on NSCLC involved various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, and pathways in cancer, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway were strongly related. Molecular docking and MD simulation suggested that key compounds in CR had high binding affinity to critical NSCLC targets, like EGFR, JAK2, SRC, and MAPK3, with stable complexes formed. This study revealed key components and mechanism of CR treating NSCLC based on a network pharmacology-driven strategy, providing a reference for in-depth study on treating NSCLC.",

The purpose of this research sought to explore how IR affects breast cancer patients' reactions after NAT. We gathered 132 individuals with breast cancer who had surgery after NAT. Continuous values were analyzed using the Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test and independent samples t test; pathological complete response (PCR)-related independent influencing factors were investigated using the binary logistic regression model; and the predictive value of each index on the effectiveness of NAT was assessed using subject work characteristics (receiver operating characteristic) curves. Compared with the non-PCR group, the PCR group's IR levels were lower. Baseline IR levels and NAT effectiveness did not significantly correlate, according to multifactorial logistic analysis (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Nevertheless, there was a negative correlation (P\u2005<\u2005.05) between PCR and total cholesterol (TC)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and MetS-IR levels following NAT. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve prediction model, TC/HDL had a greater predictive value than MetS-IR. Dynamic IR indicators (\u0394TC/HDL and \u0394MetS-IR) demonstrate predictive value for NAT response in breast cancer, mechanistically linked to lipid metabolism reprogramming and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

    "abstract": "The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly revolutionized the approach to treating advanced cancers. Despite their remarkable efficacy, not all patients exhibit favorable responses to ICI therapy. Hence, more biomarkers for therapeutic prediction need to be discovered. In this study, we utilized public cohorts to investigate the predictive significance and immunological associations of apolipoprotein L6 (APOL6) in cancers. The expression of APOL6 was found to be enhanced in tumors of patients who exhibited strong immunotherapeutic responses across various types of cancer. Furthermore, APOL6 showed immune correlations in pan-cancer and was confirmed by the tissue microarray cohort and in vitro experiments. Overall, this study highlights that APOL6 serves as a beneficial biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. Additional research involving larger numbers of patients and the underlying mechanism is necessary to determine its effectiveness as a biomarker for predicting the benefits of ICIs.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic mechanisms of artemisinin (ARS) and its derivatives in atopic dermatitis (AD) using network pharmacology and molecular docking. Molecules and disease targets were screened using public databases, including SwissTargetPrediction, PharmMapper, and Genecards. Core targets were identified, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape for topological analysis. Relevant data were obtained from the DAVID database for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Molecular docking of ARS and its derivatives with target genes was performed using AutoDock, with results visualized in Pymol. A functional PPI network was established, and molecular docking demonstrated strong binding activity between ARS derivatives and target protein. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase14 (MAPK14) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase10 (MAPK10) was found to be a common target for their treatment of AD. ARS and its derivatives may treat AD by modulating pathways such as Prolactin signaling, cancer pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and IL-17 signaling. ARS and its derivatives have the potential to treat AD. Artemisinin, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artemisinin and artemisinone could potentially treat AD by targeting MAPK14 and MAPK10.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) has become a serious global health concern due to its rising virulence and antibiotic resistance. As one of the leading members of ESKAPE pathogens, it plays a major role in a wide range of infections that cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The recent increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent (hvKP) strains due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, has greatly limited therapeutic options that highlights the need for novel approaches to combat the pathogen. This review outlines the virulence mechanisms, profiles of antibiotic resistance, and immune evasion strategies in K. pneumoniae. Also, it points out the role of capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and fimbriae in host colonization and immune evasion. Additionally, the review discusses the emerging therapeutic strategies of vaccine development, computational drug discovery, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The progress achieved in reverse vaccinology and structural biology enables the identification of new drug and vaccine targets, whereas AI and machine learning (ML) stand out as powerful candidates for high-throughput screening and drug design. However, challenges with antigenic variability, safety, and the need to collaborate globally still exist. This review focuses on the need for interdisciplinary approaches involving molecular biology and immunology with computational sciences to address K. pneumoniae infections and provide appropriate therapies in the era of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT)-mediated immunogenic cell death and immune checkpoint blockade offer new opportunities for tumor treatment. However, challenges including immunosuppression, hypoxic tumor microenvironments, and inadequate drug delivery hinder therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we developed a multifunctional biomimetic liposome microbubble named H-R@Lip@M, which is coated with melanoma cell membranes, contains perfluoropentane as its core, and is loaded with the sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether and the immune adjuvant resiquimod. The targeting properties of melanoma cell membranes enable effective accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) at tumor sites. Equipped with ultrasonic/photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these NPs allow precise control over the release of drugs and oxygen upon ultrasound stimulation. In vitro and in vivo results consistently showed that the NPs enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, halting primary tumor progression and preventing lung metastasis. Moreover, SDT increased reactive oxygen species levels within tumors, preferentially inducing apoptosis while maximizing immunogenic cell death. When combined with PD-L1 blockade, this synergy promotes dendritic cell maturation and alters various immune populations, boosting T-cell infiltration while enhancing M1 macrophage polarization and reducing regulatory T-cell presence. In summary, the proposed combination has the potential to synergistically enhance the efficacy of sono-immunotherapy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, providing valuable insights for addressing challenges associated with SDT-based cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-targeting drug delivery holds great promise for cancer treatment but faces significant challenges in penetrating solid tumors to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. By harnessing the natural tissue-penetration effect conferred by the CendR motif, we identified that the nucleolin (NCL)-targeted peptide F3 possesses tumor-penetrating capabilities. Co-administration of F3 with doxorubicin and the apoptosis-inducing protein TRAIL enhanced effective tumor penetration and improved antitumor activity. Taking advantage of TRAIL's natural self-trimerization, we developed a novel fusion protein, F3-TRAIL. This design enabled the trivalent assembly of F3 when fused with TRAIL, significantly enhancing its binding to NCL-positive tumor endothelial and parenchymal cells, resulting in deeper tumor penetration and superior antitumor effects compared to TRAIL alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that the multivalent F3-enhanced engagement with tumor cells potentiated TRAIL to trigger death receptor-dependent apoptosis signaling, even in TRAIL-resistant tumor cells. Building on this success, we constructed F3-HexaTR using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag superglue ligation system to generate a hexameric TRAIL, further amplifying cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy. Combined analysis of data from TCGA and GTEx revealed significantly elevated NCL expression across 18 solid tumor types, underscoring the clinical potential of F3-directed targeted therapy. These findings highlight that F3-mediated NCL targeting is an effective strategy to overcome tumor penetration barriers, particularly for protein drug delivery. This multivalent assembly approach represents an innovative avenue for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of various agents in the treatment of solid tumors.",

However, synthetic materials inevitably introduce incompatibilities. This has led to focusing on biomimetic drug delivery systems (DDS) based on biologically derived cell membranes. This \"top-down\" approach to nanomedicine preparation is simple and effective, as the inherited cell membranes and cell surface substances can mimic nature when delivering drugs back into the body, interacting similarly to the source cells at the biological interface. The concept of biologically derived TCM and biomimetic membranes aligns well with nature, the human body, and medicine, thereby enhancing the in vivo compatibility of TCM. This review focused on the recent progress using biomimetic membranes for TCM in cancer therapy, emphasizing the effective integration of biomimetic nanomedicine and TCM in applications such as cancer diagnosis, imaging, precision treatment, and immunotherapy. The review also provided potential suggestions on the challenges and prospects in this field.",

It is known for its enhanced ability in sparing healthy tissue and potentially reducing toxicity. Clinical experience with pencil beam scanning in the treatment of mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and outcomes of a prospectively observed cohort. A total of 162 patients were irradiated between May 2013 and December 2020, with a median age of 32\u202fyears (range: 18.4-79.2) and followed up until April 2024. The median applied dose was 30 GyE (range: 20-40). Deep inspiration breath hold was used in 146 patients to enhance targeting precision. The disease-free survival, overall survival and local control rates were 95.1\u202f%, 98.8\u202f% and 98.8\u202f%, respectively. The median follow-up was 59.1\u202fmonths (range: 4-120.1). The most common acute toxicities observed were oesophageal and skin toxicity. Grade 1 oesophageal mucositis occurred in 76 patients (47\u202f%), grade 2 in 16 patients (10\u202f%). Dermatitis of grade 1 and 2 was observed in 65 (40\u202f%) and 4 (3\u202f%) patients respectively. Grade 1 pulmonary toxicity presented in 8 patients (4.9\u202f%), and grade 2 in one patient (0.6\u202f%). The most predominant late toxicity was grade 2 hypothyroidism in 37 patients (23\u202f%). Three patients (1.8\u202f%) underwent coronary interventions during follow-up, and one patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma 3\u202fmonths post-RT. No unexpected acute or late toxicities were observed. Proton beam therapy using pencil beam scanning is a safe and effective technique in terms of toxicity and local control, even when irradiating mediastinal targets.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous and complex cancer influenced by both the tumor microenvironment and multi-level regulation of the nervous system. Increasing evidence highlights critical roles of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in modulating HCC progression. Psychological stress and emotional disturbances, representing CNS dysregulation, directly accelerate tumor growth, metastasis, and impair anti-tumor immunity in HCC. PNS involvement, particularly autonomic innervation, extensively reshapes the hepatic tumor microenvironment; specifically, sympathetic activation promotes immune suppression, tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stemness via \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) stabilization, whereas parasympathetic signals generally exert anti-inflammatory and tumor-suppressive effects mediated by acetylcholine. Neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine precisely regulate critical pathways such as AKT/mTOR, ERK, and NF-\u03baB, thereby driving malignant cell behaviors, immune evasion, and chemoresistance. Neuro-targeted pharmacological interventions (e.g., SSRIs, \u03b2-blockers, dopamine antagonists) and behavioral therapies have shown efficacy in preclinical studies, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Additionally, neural-associated biomarkers like NEDD9, CNTN1, and nerve growth factor (NGF) exhibit prognostic significance, supporting their future clinical application. By systematically integrating neuroscience with oncology, this review identifies innovative neural-based therapeutic strategies, highlights key mechanistic insights, and outlines promising directions for future research and personalized clinical management of HCC.",

Neoadjuvant therapy, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and NAC combined with immunotherapy, can improve the resection and long-term survival rates.

It has been confirmed that immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, can affect the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy. This paper summarizes current preclinical and clinical evidence to more fully describe the effects of neoadjuvant therapy on the immune microenvironment of GC, to provide the impetus to identify biomarkers to predict the potency of neoadjuvant therapy, and to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance, which should promote the development of individualized and accurate treatments for GC patients.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage-based drugs are widely used in cancer therapy, yet resistance remains a significant challenge. In this study, we uncovered a non-DNA repair mechanism contributing to resistance in cancer cells. We found that in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, CIP2A degradation via ubiquitination enhanced PP2A phosphatase activity, leading to the dephosphorylation of ATR at Ser428 in the cytoplasm. This dephosphorylation promoted the formation of the prolyl cis-isomeric form of ATR at its Ser428-Pro429 motif, a mitochondria-targeted antiapoptotic protein (mtATR). Surprisingly, the resistant PDAC cells paradoxically accumulated both mtATR and proapoptotic tBid at mitochondria, forming the mtATR-tBid complex. This complex silenced tBid, inducing apoptotic dormancy. Antagonizing mtATR, either through the PP2A inhibitor LB-100 or a cytoplasmic ATR-specific antibody, reactivated the pre-accumulated mitochondrial tBid and induced apoptosis in resistant PDAC cells. In an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, LB-100 alone significantly suppressed resistant tumor growth by disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of resistance to DNA damage-based cancer drugs and introduce a new action mechanism of LB-100, which works through mtATR-tBid complex-mediated apoptotic dormancy triggered by CIP2A degradation-mediated PP2A activation. Disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex may represent a promising strategy to restore or sensitize resistant cancer cells to apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "The MYC family of transcription factors-comprising c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC-plays a pivotal role in oncogenesis, driving cancer progression and resistance to therapy. While MYC proteins have long been considered challenging drug targets due to their intricate structures, recent advances have led to the development of promising inhibitors. This review explores the role of MYC overexpression in promoting radiotherapy resistance in aggressive neuroendocrine malignancies through multiple mechanisms, including increased tumor cell invasion, enhanced DNA damage repair and oxidative stress management, pro-survival autophagy, survival of circulating tumor cells, angiogenesis, awakening from dormancy, and modulation of chronic inflammation and host immunity. Paradoxically, MYC overexpression can also enhance radiosensitivity in certain cancer cells by driving pro-apoptotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage that overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of direct MYC inhibitors, detailing their current stage of preclinical and clinical development as novel anti-cancer therapeutics. This review highlights MYC's role in cancer metastasis and radiotherapy resistance while examining the potential of MYC inhibitors as radiosensitizers in adult and pediatric neuroendocrine malignancies, including small cell lung cancer, large cell neuroendocrine lung cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, central nervous system embryonal tumors, and medulloblastoma.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we explore key innovations in photoactivated therapeutic programming of carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), focusing on their diverse nanostructural configurations and their exceptional photothermal, photochemical, and photoacoustic properties. These attributes position CBNs as remarkable phototherapeutic agents, capable of addressing critical challenges in targeted cancer therapy through their precision, multifunctionality, and adaptability to specific therapeutic modalities. We will explore their diverse derivatives, and the role of chemical augmentation and site-specific surface functionalisation, which are pivotal in optimising the targeting and efficacy of phototherapeutic interventions. The biological and physical relevance of this ever-growing library of nanomaterials in targeted phototherapy will be thoroughly explored. Dynamic photo-triggering of the underlying molecular mechanisms of action e.g., energy conversion modalities lie at the heart of these therapeutic innovations. We will further discuss the tunability and programming of these carriers and structure-function alterations at specific therapeutic wavelengths. The application space of phototherapies is thoroughly mapped exploring the three primary approaches of photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and photochemical internalisation as well as emerging techniques and promising multimodal approaches that combine two or more of these processes. The specificity of the target tissue site and the approach under study forms another critical focus area of this review, with an emphasis on three types of cancer-breast cancer, lung cancer, and gliomas-that have demonstrated some of the most promising outcomes from photomedicine. We also provide a perspective on in vitro and in vivo validation and preclinical testing of CBNs for phototherapeutic applications. Finally, we reflect on the potential of CBNs to revolutionise targeted cancer therapy through data-driven materials design and integration with computational tools for biophysical performance optimisation. The exciting integration of machine learning into nanoparticle research and phototherapy has potential to fundamentally transform the landscape of nanomedicine. These techniques ranging from supervised learning algorithms such as random forests and support vector machines to more advanced neural networks and deep learning, can enable unprecedented precision in predicting, optimising, and tailoring the properties of nanoparticles for targeted applications. The transformative impact of photoactivated CBNs in advancing cancer treatment, paves the way for their clinical application and widespread adoption in personalised photomedicine. We conclude with a section on the current challenges facing the reproducibility, manufacturing throughput, and biocompatibility of these nanostructured materials including their long-term effects in trials and degradation profiles in biological systems as evaluated in vitro and in vivo.",

    "title": "Assessing liposomal nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery through electroporation.",
    "abstract": "Electroporation (EP) is a technique that temporarily increases cell membrane permeability through high-voltage electrical pulses, facilitating the internalization of hydrophilic drugs. When used in clinics, reversible EP offers significant advantages in drug delivery with minimal systemic toxicity, making it a promising approach in cancer therapy (Electrochemotherapy). However, is still challenging to increase therapeutic efficacy, such as increasing the amount of drug internalized by cells after EP. To address these limitations, integrating nanocarriers-particularly liposomes-into EP-based drug delivery strategies has shown great promise. Due to their structural similarity to cell membranes, liposomes can undergo electroporation without causing irreversible cell damage, enabling localized and controlled drug release at targeted sites. This study preliminary evaluates the effectiveness of positively charged gentamicin sulfate loaded liposomes (GS-Lipo) in enhancing gentamicin sulfate uptake through electroporation. The focus is on liposome behavior under EP, drug release, and cellular internalization. The results reveal a strong interplay between liposomes and EP. While EP minimally affects liposome size (sizes lower than 250\u202fnm before and after EP) and PDI, it significantly enhances intracellular uptake and drug release by creating transient pores in liposomal bilayer, facilitating gentamicin diffusion. In vitro uptake studies performed with fluorescent liposomes and GS-Lipo, confirmed superior performance when combined treatment (EP\u202f+\u202fGS-Lipo) is used. By optimizing electroporation parameters (160\u202fV, 200\u202fV, and 250\u202fV), this study succeeds in maximizing intracellular drug concentration, with the long-term goal of improving therapeutic outcomes, particularly in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aims at exploring the role of LACTB on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell differentiation. In this study, 143 colorectal cancer tissue samples were collected for analyzing the correlation between LACTB level and clinical information. Another 24 recent cases and adjacent tissues underwent qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect LACTB expression. The differentiation and proliferation of CRC cells were evaluated by AKP levels, E-cadherin expression, cell viability, colony formation, EdU assay, and cell cycle. Subcutaneous models explored LACTB's pro-differentiation effects. The glandular-like structures of tumor were observed by HE staining, immunofluorescence detection of microvilli proteins, and transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that LACTB expression in colorectal cancer tissues was lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. Higher LACTB expression was correlated with slower tumor progression, better prognosis and higher differentiation degree. Overexpressing LACTB in CRC cells enhanced differentiation markers level (AKP and E-cadherin), while inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest. Conversely, LACTB knockdown had an opposite effect. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor model suggested that LACTB overexpression inhibited tumor growth, induced tissue differentiation and glandular-like structures formation. Collectively, our results show that LACTB overexpression promotes cell differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in CRC cells, which may serve as a therapy target for CRC.",

Late-stage diagnosis, often accompanied by metastatic dissemination, drastically impairs patient survival and underscores the urgent need for improved biomarkers to guide therapeutic strategies. While molecular signatures have been proposed to stratify pancreatic cancer patients, their ability to predict outcomes remains limited. In this study, we applied established molecular signatures to our in-house transcriptomic data from a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. We took advantage of published datasets to construct comprehensive atlases of cells present in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers. The atlas of metastasis samples, representative of routinely harvested patient biopsies, revealed that monocyte/macrophage signatures provided superior discriminatory power compared to existing molecular classifications. Notably, the abundance of TREM2-expressing macrophages emerged as a significant parameter for stratifying patients. Our findings position TREM2",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a transformative approach for cancer therapy, enabling precise gene silencing through small interfering RNA (siRNA). However, the clinical application of siRNA-based treatments faces challenges such as rapid degradation, inefficient cellular uptake, and immune system clearance. Nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery has revolutionized cancer therapy by addressing these limitations, improving siRNA stability, tumor-specific targeting, and therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements in nanocarrier engineering have introduced innovative strategies to enhance the safety and precision of siRNA-based therapies, offering new opportunities for personalized medicine. This review highlights three key innovations in nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery: artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nanocarrier design, multifunctional nanoparticles for combined therapeutic strategies, and biomimetic nanocarriers for enhanced biocompatibility. AI-driven nanocarriers utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize nanoparticle properties, improving drug release profiles and minimizing off-target effects. Multifunctional nanoparticles integrate siRNA with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photothermal therapy, enabling synergistic treatment approaches that enhance therapeutic outcomes and reduce drug resistance. Biomimetic nanocarriers, including exosome-mimicking systems and cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles, improve circulation time, immune evasion, and targeted tumor delivery. These innovations collectively enhance the precision, efficiency, and safety of siRNA-based cancer therapies. The scope and novelty of these advancements lie in their ability to overcome the primary barriers of siRNA delivery while paving the way for clinically viable solutions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest developments in nanocarrier fabrication, preclinical and clinical studies, and safety assessments. By integrating AI-driven design, multifunctionality, and biomimicry, nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery holds immense potential for the future of precision cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapies are one potential approach to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory or relapsed disease. However, comprehensive testing in scarce primary patient material is hampered by the many drug combination possibilities. Furthermore, inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity necessitates personalized treatment optimization approaches that effectively exploit patient-specific vulnerabilities to selectively target both the disease- and resistance-driving cell populations. Here, we developed a systematic combinatorial design strategy that uses machine learning to prioritize the most promising drug combinations for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The predictive approach leveraged single-cell transcriptomics and single-agent response profiles measured in primary patient samples to identify targeted combinations that co-inhibit treatment resistant cancer cells individually in each AML patient sample. Cell type compositions evolved dynamically between the diagnostic and R/R stages uniquely in each patient, hence requiring personalized drug combination strategies to target therapy-resistant cancer cells. Cell population-specific drug combination assays demonstrated how patient-specific and disease stage-tailored combination predictions led to treatments with synergy and strong potency in R/R AML cells, while the same combinations elicited non-synergistic effects in the diagnostic stage and minimal co-inhibitory effects on normal cells. In preliminary experiments on clinical trial samples, the approach predicted clinical outcomes to venetoclax-azacitidine combination therapy in patients with AML. Overall, the computational-experimental approach provides a rational means to identify personalized combinatorial regimens for individual AML patients with R/R disease that target treatment-resistant leukemic cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical translation.",

In this study, we aimed to develop a prognostic model for endometrial cancer (EC) patients based on mitochondria-related genes (MRGs), and to investigate the role of MACC1 in EC. As shown in the graphic summary, we retrieved gene expression and clinical data from open-access databases. To construct a predictive signature, we applied the Lasso Cox regression algorithm to MRGs. The predictive performance, immune features, and anti-tumor response of the mitochondrial signature were evaluated through multiple algorithms. Additionally, expression levels of key genes were validated using quantitative Real-Time PCR and Western Blot. A total of 2030 MRGs were retrieved, and 267 were found to be prognostically relevant. Eight MRGs-MACC1, CMPK2, NDUFAF6, DUSP18, TOMM40L, MT-TP, SAMM50, and MAIP1-were identified to construct a prognostic signature for EC. The MRG signature demonstrated significant associations with drug sensitivity, immune therapy, and immune cell infiltration. Based on comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, MACC1 was identified as the most promising MRG candidate in EC. Systematic experimental validation, including both in vitro and in vivo approaches, demonstrated that MACC1\u00a0down-regulation\u00a0significantly suppressed EC progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Over 47,000 human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers are newly diagnosed every year in the United States, yet HPV vaccination rates are below desirable levels. Young adulthood is critical for catch-up HPV vaccination. Previous research on HPV vaccine-seeking behavior among young adults is limited, particularly in Tennessee. This study aimed to understand HPV vaccine perceptions and experiences of young adults. Virtual semi-structured interviews were conducted among 18-26-year-olds at a university in Tennessee from April to May 2022 (N\u2009=\u200925). Interview questions were based on the Health Belief Model and previous literature with a focus on gaining in-depth insights into young adults' perspectives regarding HPV vaccination. Inductive and deductive thematic analysis approaches were used for data analysis. Five major themes were identified: (1) perceptions about HPV and HPV vaccination, (2) factors that may prevent HPV vaccination, (3) role of health care providers, (4) role of family and friends, and (5) HPV vaccine promotion strategies. Participants commonly discussed lack of knowledge and awareness as a factor preventing HPV vaccine uptake. Participants described some facilitators of HPV vaccination, including healthcare provider recommendations and family support, and perceived future benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine. Suggestions for promotion strategies included promotion through college health centers, community education, and awareness campaigns. Young adults' perceptions about the HPV vaccine and inadequate knowledge may influence uptake. Findings from this study showed that healthcare provider recommendations and parental support were facilitators for getting vaccinated. Future efforts may consider increasing awareness among young adults, exploring barriers to recommendation, and addressing parental concerns.",
