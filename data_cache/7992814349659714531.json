Participants were assigned randomly to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel 75 mg/m\\^2 Q3W. The total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis.\n\nEligible participants who were allocated to the first course of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to receive a second course of pembrolizumab as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.\n\nProtocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.\n\nWith Protocol Amendment 15 (effective date: 03 Jan 2018), all second course and switch over participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Response or progression during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards efficacy outcome measures, and adverse events during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards safety outcome measures.\n\nAlso with Amendment 15, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study (Keynote 587; NCT03486873) to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Switch over participants who have not transitioned to pembrolizumab will be considered for the extension study on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe primary study hypotheses are that pembolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent radiologists' review in previously-treated participants with NSCLC in the strongly positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) stratum compared to docetaxel and in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 compared to docetaxel.",

    "description": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological form, accounting for 85% of all bronchopulmonary cancers (PBC). The advent of Immunity Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) targeting Programmed cell Death-1 (PD-1) is changing current treatment algorithms.\n\nPreliminary results from work carried out in the Medical Oncology Department of the University Hospital of Tours suggest that immunotherapy targeting ICI, when administered beforehand, increases the effect of catch-up chemotherapy. In NSCLC, the progression-free survival (PFS) of 3rd line chemotherapy after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was better than the PFS of 3rd line chemotherapy performed at the end of conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy gives paradoxically better results than immunotherapy alone.\n\nImmunotherapy restores the anti-tumor T immunity inhibited by the cancer cell. While the mode of action of ICIs is well known, the mechanisms of resistance to them are poorly understood. Several pathways are evoked, in particular the modulation of cellular interactions within the tumour microenvironment (TME), the molecular expression profile of cancer cells, or the immunological status of the patient.\n\nRegulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) participate in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis by ensuring tolerance to self antigens. Within TME, Treg inhibit anti-tumor T cell activity and potentiate tumor proliferation. The latter, by specifically recognizing tumor antigens, block the activity of effector T lymphocytes directed against tumor cells. Thus, an increase in circulating Treg concentrations and in TME is a poor prognostic factor, especially in NSCLC.\n\nGemcitabine chemotherapy is commonly used in the management of NSCLC. Recent data show that gemcitabine decreases Treg activity and regulates levels of anti-inflammatory TME cytokines such as IL10, TGF-\u03b2 and interferon-\u0194.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that the decrease in Treg blood concentration by catch-up chemotherapy restores sensitivity to immunotherapy.",

To prevent muscle loss in cancer, stimulating muscle protein anabolism (growth) by fueling muscles with protein is crucial. Dairy products are not only a source of high-quality protein but are a preferred food choice for cancer patients as they progress through chemotherapy treatment. Although commercially available oral nutritional supplements containing essential amino acids are often promoted for protein anabolism, these products are not preferred by cancer patients. Moreover, our research group has shown that patients consuming oral nutritional supplements actually lose more weight than those who chose regular whole-food items. Evidence of the health effects of consuming dairy products is needed to influence dietary recommendations for people with cancer. The objective of our study is to perform a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of dairy products to maintain muscle mass and strength and improve patient outcomes in people undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",

One group receives zongertinib at regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy) into a vein.\n\nParticipants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12 weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works.

    "description": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in China. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitor has gradually become a research hotspot, and it has continuously achieved huge breakthroughs. The FDA and NMPA have approved multiple PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for first-line or second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. But In clinical practice, there is still some controversy about PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, especially for patients with low PD-L1 expression, the efficacy of monotherapy needs to be further improved. Strong genetic and functional evidence indicates that FGFR dysregulation can lead to the development and progression of cancer. Genetic alterations of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been found in a variety of tumors. Squamous non-small cell lung cancer has about 13% of FGFR variants, while there are only 4% of any FGFR variants in lung adenocarcinoma. Studies of FGFR inhibitors in NSCLC show that AZD4575 has shown partial efficacy in FGFR partially mutated and expanded lung squamous cell carcinoma. FGFR pathway is involved in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. In the tumor suppressor model of rectal cancer, it has been observed that FGFR2 overexpression promotes the expression of PD-L1 by activating JAK/STAT3 pathway, leading to tumor growth. In a lung cancer suppressor mouse model, the combination of FGFR inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor can improve tumor remission and prolong survival. Based on the preliminary clinical data, this study assumes that Sintilimab(anti-PD-1) combined with Pemigatinib(FGFR inhibitor) can further improve efficay of advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 positive and FGFR1-3 mutation) including but not limited to FGFR amplification, rearrangement/fusion, mutation, etc.).",

    "description": "Background:\n\nMany cancer cells produce substances called antigens that are unique to each cancer. These antigens stimulate the body s immune responses. One approach to treating these cancers is to take disease-fighting white blood cells from a person, change those cells so they will target the specific proteins (called antigens) from the cancer cells, and return them to that person s blood. The use of the white blood cells in this manner is one form of gene therapy. A vaccine may help these modified white cells work better.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test a cancer treatment that uses a person s own modified white blood cells along with a vaccine that targets a specific protein.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 to 72 years with certain solid tumors that have spread after treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will undergo leukapheresis: Blood is removed from the body through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. The blood passes through a machine that separates out the white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body through a second needle.\n\nParticipants will stay in the hospital for 3 or 4 weeks. They will take chemotherapy drugs for 1 week to prepare for the treatment. Then their modified white cells will be infused through a needle in the arm. They will take other drugs to prevent infections after the infusion.\n\nThe vaccine is injected into a muscle; participants will receive their first dose of the vaccine on the same day as their cell infusion.\n\nParticipants will have follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the cell infusions. They will receive 2 or 3 additional doses of the boost vaccine during these visits.\n\nFollow-up will continue for 5 years, but participants will need to stay in touch with the gene therapy team for 15 years.\n\n...",
