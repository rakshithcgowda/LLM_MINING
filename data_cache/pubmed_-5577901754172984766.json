    "abstract": "Previous studies in multiple metastatic tumors treated with diverse anticancer agents including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, mAb, and TKIs have suggested the rate of tumor growth (g-score) is inversely associated with survival. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), or chemotherapy to investigate the impact of those therapies on g-score and explore the association of g-score with clinical outcomes. This is the first report assessing g-score in tumors treated with an ADC. We investigated the association of g-score with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 2 phase 3 studies in patients with HER2\u2005+\u2005mBC (DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03)) and HER2-low mBC (DESTINY-Breast04 (DB-04)). After grouping patients according to quartiles of g-scores, we explored the association between g-score and PFS/OS using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models. The median g-score was higher for T-DM1, suggesting a faster growth rate at 0.0009/day vs that for T-DXd at 0.0002/day (P\u2005<\u2005.0001). Additionally, with data collection stopped at the time of database lock, 23% and 48% of tumors demonstrated only regression without growth in the T-DM1 and T-DXd arms, respectively. In DB-04, median g was 0.0018/day and 0.0006/day (P\u2005<\u2005.0001); with 17% and 32% of tumors demonstrating only regression with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) and T-DXd, respectively. Compared to T-DM1 and TPC therapies, T-DXd significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth in the overall population and across subgroups. In both studies, the tumor growth rate was inversely associated with PFS and OS. In addition, it showed improved concordance with survival compared to ORR. The use of tumor growth rate as an intermediate endpoint may potentially accelerate drug development and reduce a patient's exposure to agents with limited or no activity.",

    "abstract": "The phase 3 DESTINY-Breast04 trial demonstrated superior efficacy and acceptable safety with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) vs physician's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We report the patient-reported outcomes (PROs), focusing on the hormone receptor-positive cohort. Patients were randomized 2:1 to T-DXd (5.4\u00a0mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) or physician's choice of chemotherapy and prospectively assessed for PRO measures. Change from baseline and time to definitive deterioration (TDD) were calculated from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR45 and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. Baseline global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) scores were similar between groups (T-DXd, 331 patients; physician's choice, 163 patients); there were no clinically meaningful changes while on either treatment (median duration: T-DXd, 8.2 months; physician's choice, 3.5 months). Median TDD for GHS/QoL was delayed with T-DXd vs physician's choice (11.4 vs 7.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92). Median TDD for all prespecified PROs, including pain, favored T-DXd. In an additional analysis, the median TDD was shorter for nausea and vomiting with T-DXd vs the physician's choice. Trastuzumab deruxtecan maintained GHS/QoL scores despite a longer treatment course compared with standard chemotherapy and delayed definitive deterioration across all prespecified PROs vs the physician's choice. Appropriate management of adverse events and use of preventive measures (ie, antiemetic prophylaxis) may further support patient health-related quality of life. These findings reinforce the benefit of T-DXd as an option for patients with HER2-low mBC. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03734029.",

Discovering biomarkers that assess cardiotoxicity risk before trastuzumab therapy is essential for protecting the cardiovascular health of cancer patients. To examine the associations between pre-treatment epigenetic age acceleration, circulating leukocyte composition, and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cardiotoxicity risk in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab. Among a retrospective cohort of HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab at Moffitt Cancer Center, we profiled blood DNA methylation and genetic profiles. Epigenetic clocks and circulating leukocyte subsets were derived from MethylationEPIC BeadChip data, and candidate SNPs were measured using the Global Screening Array. Cardiotoxicity events (i.e., reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction, symptomatic heart failure), were identified in medical records. Logistic regression models, adjusted for traditional risk factors, estimated odds ratios (ORs) for biomarker associations with cardiotoxicity risk. Among 157 patients selected for this study, 39 (25%) experienced cardiotoxicities within one year of treatment initiation. rs776746 was inversely associated with cardiotoxicity risk (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14, 1.00, P\u2009=\u20090.05). After adjusting for traditional risk factors and leukocyte composition, the Hannum AgeAccel, Horvath AgeAccel, and Horvath Skin and Blood AgeAccel metrics were significantly positively associated with cardiotoxicity risk (ORs ranging between 1.62 and 1.89). Adding Horvath Skin and Blood AgeAccel to traditional cardiotoxicity risk factors significantly improved cardiotoxicity risk prediction (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.79; P-diff\u2009=\u20090.04). Pre-treatment epigenetic age acceleration appears to be a novel biomarker for cardiotoxicity risk that improves cardiotoxicity risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant systemic therapy with dual HER2-blockade, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, combined with chemotherapy has become a standard approach in patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC). However, the variability in treatment outcomes, such as pathological complete response (pCR) or relapse rates, underscores the need to identify predictive factors to optimize therapeutic strategies. This study aims to explore the relationship between clinicopathological factors and both pCR and disease-free survival (DFS) in an international cohort of patients with HER2+ BC, contributing to defining personalized treatment strategies. An international, multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 517 patients with HER2+ BC who received neoadjuvant therapy comprising trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy. Data were collected between January 2016 and December 2023. The relationship between clinicopathological factors and treatment outcomes was analyzed using univariate tests, logistic regression for pCR, and Cox proportional hazards regression for DFS. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests and hazard ratios were used to compare DFS across subgroups. Multivariable analysis revealed that hormonal receptor (HR) expression and nodal status significantly predicted the achievement of pCR in this cohort. Factors such as age, HR status, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, nodal status, and pathological response were associated with relapse risk. Our real-world data demonstrates that a comprehensive approach considering pCR, age, HR status, and nodal involvement is essential for personalized treatment strategies. These factors should be taken into account when deciding whether to escalate or de-escalate treatment, contributing to improved HER2+ BC patient outcomes.",

Although HER2-targeted therapies have improved outcomes for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (mBC), clinical challenges and prognostic variability remain. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in various tumors, including BC, but their role in HER2+ mBC is poorly understood. This multicentric retrospective cohort study evaluated the prognostic significance of TILs in 110 patients with HER2+ mBC treated with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and taxane-based chemotherapy at two Italian institutes from June 2013 to May 2024. TILs were assessed on metastatic or primary tumor samples. High TILs levels (>5%) were independently associated with longer PFS and OS. TILs levels were higher in primary tumours than in metastases (p\u2009=\u20090.009), with significant variation by metastatic site. These findings underscore the potential of TILs as prognostic biomarkers in HER2+ mBC, necessitating further prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding breast cancer at a molecular level is essential for developing effective treatments due to its significant impact on women's mortality rates globally. Targeted medicines focus on specific proteins crucial to breast cancer progression, offering a promising treatment avenue. These proteins, often overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells, are vital for cell proliferation, division, and survival. Targeted drugs aim to inhibit these proteins, halting disease progression and sparing non-cancerous cells, which reduces side effects and improves patient quality of life. Key proteins in breast cancer treatment include HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), ER (estrogen receptor), and PR (progesterone receptor). Drugs like Trastuzumab target HER2 to impede tumor growth in HER2-positive cancers, while hormone therapies targeting ER and PR improve outcomes for hormone receptor-positive cancers. Examining proteins such as EGFR, HER2/Neu, and ER reveals their roles in cancer pathways, with pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) being crucial targets for therapies, potentially revolutionizing breast cancer treatment.",

VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global database of adverse events (AEs), containing reports from November 1967 to December 2023, was used. Signals for pertuzumab-associated AEs in breast cancer cases were detected using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Signals of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab relative to trastuzumab alone were detected in gastrointestinal disorders (ROR: 1.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.67), including diarrhoea (3.49, 2.83-4.30); infections and infestations (1.54, 1.24-1.91); and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (ROR: 1.63, 1.40-1.90), including pruritus (1.96, 1.51-2.55) and rash (1.63, 1.20-2.23). Further, signals of trastuzumab plus docetaxel plus pertuzumab relative to those of trastuzumab plus docetaxel were detected in gastrointestinal disorders (1.63, 1.38-1.93), including nausea (1.72, 1.24-2.39) and vomiting (1.48, 1.01-2.17), and in nervous system disorders (1.50, 1.20-1.87), including paraesthesia (2.60, 1.33-5.08) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.94, 1.79-19.71). The frequency of AEs causing or prolonging hospitalization was increased with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab compared to that with trastuzumab alone (1.18, 1.00-1.38). AE profiles after the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based therapy were comprehensively identified.

In an ongoing, two-part, phase 2a study, we assessed the safety and antitumour activity of zanidatamab, a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody, plus palbociclib and fulvestrant, in heavily pretreated patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This multicentre, single-arm, two-part, phase 2a study is being conducted at 13 university hospitals, cancer centres, or research institutes in Spain, Canada, and the USA. Eligible patients were adults (aged \u226518 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and with pathologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic breast cancer, assessed locally to be hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive, with disease progression during or after previous HER2-targeted therapies. Patients were enrolled in part 1, part 2, or part 1 followed by part 2. In part 1, patients received starting doses of zanidatamab (20 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) with palbociclib (125 mg orally once a day on days 1-21 of each cycle) and fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection once every 2 weeks for the first three doses [cycle 1: days 1 and 15, cycle 2: day 1], then once every 4 weeks [all subsequent cycles: day 1]). In part 1, primary endpoints were safety of the triplet combination and confirmation of recommended doses for part 2. In part 2, patients received the recommended doses confirmed in part 1, and the primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months. Safety and progression-free survival were assessed in all enrolled patients who received any dose of zanidatamab, palbociclib, or fulvestrant. Patients in part 1 who were treated at the recommended doses were analysed together with the patients in part 2. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04224272, and is active with recruitment completed. Overall, 51 patients (49 [96%] female and two [4%] male; median age 54\u00b70 [46\u00b70-62\u00b70] years; 42 [82%] White) were enrolled: eight in part 1 (June 10, 2020-Feb 7, 2021) and 43 in part 2 (Feb 8, 2021-Oct 31, 2022). All 51 patients had received study treatment at the data cutoff (Aug 3, 2023); median follow-up was 16\u00b71 months (IQR 9\u00b79-23\u00b74) and the median duration of triplet regimen treatment was 7\u00b74 months (3\u00b74-14\u00b78). The median number of previous HER2-targeted therapies was 4 (IQR 3-4). 12 (24%) of 51 patients had previously received trastuzumab deruxtecan. The planned starting drug doses administered in part 1 of the study were confirmed as the recommended doses for part 2. All 51 patients were treated at the recommended doses. All 51 patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event of any grade, with diarrhoea being the most common (41 [80%] patients, with 34 [67%] having grade 1-2 events). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (67%) patients, with neutropenia being the most common (26 [51%] patients). One (2%) patient had a serious grade 3 treatment-related adverse event of increased transaminases. No treatment-related deaths occurred. In the overall sample (N=51), progression-free survival at 6 months was 66\u00b77% (95% CI 52\u00b71-79\u00b72).

The safety and efficacy of CT-P6 were evaluated over 1\u00a0year. CT-P6 was primarily combined with fluoropyrimidine and/or platinum agents. Adverse events occurred in 151 patients (88.3%), with 55 patients (32.2%) experiencing grade 3 or higher. Infusion reactions occurred in 12.3%. Four cardiac disorders were reported: two of grade 1 cardiac dysfunction and two of severe ischemic heart disease. Interstitial lung disease was reported in four patients (2.3%). The objective response rate was 34.4%, and the disease control rate was 82.4%. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4\u00a0months. Significant risk factors for PFS included gastroesophageal junction, \u2265\u20093 metastases, no gastrectomy, prior chemotherapy, and no platinum agent. In this cohort study, CT-P6 demonstrated sufficient efficacy and no new safety concerns in HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer, serving as a cost-effective alternative to originator trastuzumab.

This study aimed to identify the most suitable first-line treatment regimen for patients with PD-L1 expression <1% (PD-L1-negative) NSCLC by comparing nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NI), NI combined with chemotherapy (NICT), and pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (PCT). We analyzed data from 141 patients with PD-L1-negative NSCLC treated with NI, NICT, or PCT at 14 Japanese institutions between December 2020 and November 2022. Propensity score analysis was employed to minimize selection bias, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Neither NI nor NICT demonstrated superior PFS or OS than PCT. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences between treatment groups across age, histological subtypes, or clinical features. Results from propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting were consistent with those observed in the overall cohort. Moreover, safety profiles showed that PCT was associated with the lowest rates of treatment discontinuation and immune-related adverse events requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. In patients with PD-L1-negative NSCLC, the efficacy of NI and NICT was not superior to that of PCT. Thus, we concluded that PCT could be a favorable treatment option for this patient population.",

    "title": "Advancing Breast Cancer Treatment: The Role of Immunotherapy and Cancer Vaccines in Overcoming Therapeutic Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health challenge due to its complex biology, which complicates both diagnosis and treatment. Immunotherapy and cancer vaccines have emerged as promising alternatives, harnessing the body's immune system to precisely target and eliminate cancer cells. However, several key factors influence the selection and effectiveness of these therapies, including BC subtype, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PD-L1 expression, HER2 resistance, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). BC subtypes play a critical role in shaping treatment responses. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits the highest sensitivity to immunotherapy, while HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtypes often require combination strategies for optimal outcomes. High TMB enhances immune responses by generating neoantigens, making tumors more susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); whereas, low TMB may indicate resistance. Similarly, elevated TIL levels are associated with better immunotherapy efficacy, while PD-L1 expression serves as a key predictor of checkpoint inhibitor success. Meanwhile, HER2 resistance and an immunosuppressive TME contribute to immune evasion, highlighting the need for multi-faceted treatment approaches. Current breast cancer immunotherapies encompass a range of targeted treatments. HER2-directed therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, block HER2 dimerization and enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), while small-molecule inhibitors, like lapatinib and tucatinib, suppress HER2 signaling to curb tumor growth. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) improve tumor targeting by coupling monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic agents, minimizing off-target effects. Meanwhile, ICIs, including pembrolizumab, restore T-cell function, and CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy leverages macrophages to reshape the TME and overcome immunotherapy resistance. While immunotherapy, particularly in TNBC, has demonstrated promise by eliciting durable immune responses, its efficacy varies across subtypes. Challenges such as immune-related adverse events, resistance mechanisms, high costs, and delayed responses remain barriers to widespread success. Breast cancer vaccines-including protein-based, whole-cell, mRNA, dendritic cell, and epitope-based vaccines-aim to stimulate tumor-specific immunity. Though clinical success has been limited, ongoing research is refining vaccine formulations, integrating combination therapies, and identifying biomarkers for improved patient stratification. Future advancements in BC treatment will depend on optimizing immunotherapy through biomarker-driven approaches, addressing tumor heterogeneity, and developing innovative combination therapies to overcome resistance. By leveraging these strategies, researchers aim to enhance treatment efficacy and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Splenic index score as a predictor of outcomes in metastatic non small cell lung cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have emerged as promising treatments for advanced NSCLC patients without actionable mutations. However, predicting treatment response remains challenging, especially in second-line settings. Although PD-L1 is the only validated biomarker, additional prognostic tools are needed. Systemic inflammation markers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) show potential but remain underused. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), linked to immunotherapy resistance, are associated with increased splenic volume. Therefore this study introduces a splenic index score, combining pre-immunotherapy splenic volume and NLR, to evaluate its prognostic value in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab in the second-line setting. We analyzed 50 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received nivolumab as second-line or later therapy. Baseline splenic volume and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were assessed using imaging and laboratory data prior to nivolumab initiation. The Splenic Index Score for each patient was calculated using the formula: (baseline splenic volume) \u00d7 (NLR). Additionally, we evaluated the impact of other factors, including body mass index (BMI), tumor PD-L1 expression, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and sites of metastasis. The median Splenic Index score was 877.3 (range: 180-4830). A higher Splenic Index score was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). Specifically, patients with a high Splenic Index score had a median PFS of 3 months, compared to 8 months in those with a low Splenic Index score (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1-3.7, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Similarly, the median OS was 4 months for patients with a high Splenic Index score, while it was 15 months for those with a low score (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.3, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Baseline splenic volume, basal NLR, and tumor PD-L1 expression were also evaluated; however, no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed for these parameters. Our study demonstrates that the splenic index score, derived from combining radiological and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, serves as a predictive tool for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic NSCLC patients receiving second-line nivolumab therapy.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that about 30-40% of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer might achieve excellent outcomes without chemotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to test the pathological complete response after the addition of pembrolizumab to dual anti-HER2 blockade and omission of chemotherapy in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer. WSG-KEYRICHED-1 was a single-arm, multicentre, open-label, hypothesis-generating phase 2 trial done at 15 breast cancer centres in Germany. Women aged 18 years and older, with previously untreated clinical stage T1c-T3, N0-N2, M0, primary unilateral early invasive breast cancer, and locally confirmed HER2 immunohistochemistry score 2+ or 3+ status, and hormone receptor-positive or receptor-negative status, were enrolled. Women with centrally confirmed HER2-enriched subtype by prediction analysis of microarrays 50 gene set (PAM50) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were allocated to four cycles of intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks), intravenous trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks), and intravenous pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks for 12 weeks). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a pathological complete response (defined as ypN0 or ypT0/is), assessed in the full analysis set, which included all patients who had at least one dose of trial treatment and had central tumour assessment within 3 weeks after the end of trial treatment. For the primary endpoint to be met, at least 52\u00b72% of patients had to have a pathological complete response to support the hypothesis that the proportion of patients with pathological complete response after trial treatment would be higher than 40% with statistical significance. Safety was analysed in all patients who had at least one dose of trial treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03988036, and has been completed. Between Sept 2, 2020, and May 5, 2021, 48 women were enrolled, of whom four did not have surgery, and one had only a local pathological complete response assessment. Therefore, 43 patients with central pathological complete response assessment were included in the full analysis set. Median follow-up was 8\u00b76 months (IQR 8\u00b73-9\u00b70). 20 (47%) of 43 patients had a pathological complete response by central assessment (lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI 33%), thus the null hypothesis (40% pathological complete response) could not be rejected (p=0\u00b722). Four (8%) of 48 patients had grade 3-4 adverse events deemed related to drug treatment. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (n=1), drug hypersensitivity (n=1), nephritis (n=1), and panic attack (n=1). Serious adverse events occurred in four (8%) of 48 patients, which were drug hypersensitivity (n=1), panic attack (n=1), pyrexia (n=1), and COVID-19 (n=1). Pembrolizumab was discontinued or postponed due to adverse events in three (6%) of 48 patients. No deaths occurred. Although the null hypothesis could not be rejected, the WSG-KEYRICHED-1 trial highlights the potential of a short chemotherapy-free combination of pembrolizumab with dual anti-HER2 therapy, warranting the initiation of randomised trials investigating the immunotherapy without chemotherapy in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer.

    "abstract": "Targeting the programmed death (ligand)-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), like pembrolizumab, has improved cancer survival. Unfortunately, the optimal dose remains unknown and less than 50\u00a0% of patients respond. Understanding PD-1 receptor pharmacology and developing early-response biomarkers are crucial to personalize therapy. We hypothesize that characterizing individual pre-treatment variability in immune responses to pembrolizumab will enhance PD-1 receptor pharmacology insights and improve treatment response prediction. Hence, this study evaluates the performance of a newly developed ex vivo immunopharmacological bioassay under healthy and pathological states. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were stimulated in vitro in the presence of pembrolizumab. PD-1 expression, interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion, T cell differentiation, expression of activation markers and phosphorylation of T cell signalling molecules were analysed. In healthy individuals, receptor saturation occurred at >0.025\u00a0\u03bcg/mL pembrolizumab. Yet IL-2 production still increased significantly beyond this concentration. NSCLC patients showed significantly higher PD-1 expression and IL-2 production than healthy individuals. Nevertheless, pembrolizumab induced IL-2 production similarly in both cohorts. In NSCLC patients, pembrolizumab inhibited differentiation towards CD4 central memory T cells. Remarkably, phosphorylation of proximal phospho-markers in response to pembrolizumab varied between NSCLC patients, potentially discriminating responders from non-responders. We highlight the importance of evaluating T cell functionality alongside PD-1 receptor occupancy. We identified PD-1-induced modulation of phosphorylation of proximal signalling molecules as potential predictors for ICI treatment response in NSCLC. We recommend further development of this immunopharmacological bioassay for personalization of ICI treatment.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-1 signaling has an essential role in tumor progression and immunosuppression and is linked to acquired resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Nadunolimab is an IL1RAP (IL-1 receptor accessory protein)-targeting antibody that blocks IL-1\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 signaling and has enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of nadunolimab with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic solid tumors who had progressed on previous checkpoint inhibitor treatment, suggesting acquired checkpoint inhibitor resistance (NCT04452214). This phase 1b trial enrolled patients with metastatic disease who had exhausted or declined standard-of-care alternatives. Patients received nadunolimab (5 mg/kg) and standard-dose pembrolizumab. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives were anti-tumor response as per iRECIST, pharmacokinetics, and changes in immune mediators. Fifteen patients with stage IV cancer (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma) entered the trial. Grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 adverse events were reported for 7 patients (47%). There was one dose-limiting toxicity of febrile neutropenia.

This retrospective, nationwide study included 410 individuals diagnosed in Norway during 2017 to 2021 with stage IV non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 expression \u226550%, and treated first line with the ICI pembrolizumab, either as monotherapy (n\u00a0= 317) or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (n\u00a0= 93). We analyzed early (6-month) and overall (3-year) risk of death after treatment initiation using Cox regression, adjusted for and stratified by sex, age, stage, PD-L1 expression, performance status, and education. Patients treated with combination therapy had a higher median overall survival compared with monotherapy (22.6 months versus 14.2 months), and reduced risk of overall death, although not statistically significant after adjustment [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.00]. However, the risk of early death was significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy, even after adjustment (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.76). Across most subgroups, patients receiving combination therapy had comparable or superior survival outcomes relative to those receiving monotherapy. Particularly noteworthy were the observed benefits from combination therapy over monotherapy among females, individuals with stage IVB disease, and those with PD-L1 expression exceeding 75%. Our real-world study demonstrates that combination therapy with ICI and chemotherapy provides superior early survival benefits over monotherapy in PD-L1-high patients. Additionally, certain subgroups showed enhanced overall survival. These findings challenge current treatment practices and underscore the need for further validation to optimize patient selection for monotherapy versus combination therapy, in particular to reassess the role of PD-L1 in treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Brain metastasis is a serious complication in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Brainstem metastases are particularly challenging to treat because of the high risks associated with surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We present a case of a 56-year-old woman with HER2-positive breast cancer who developed multiple brain metastases, including a large medullary lesion, 9 months after surgery confirming a pathological complete response to standard trastuzumab plus pertuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, without extracranial lesions. Surgery was deemed infeasible because the lesion's location and size posed high risks of toxicity from SRS. Promising intracranial responses to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have been reported; therefore, T-DXd was chosen. Remarkable symptomatic improvements were observed within days after initiating T-DXd. Imaging confirmed radiographic responses and metabolic response indicated by the absence of uptake of  This case indicates the efficacy of T-DXd in treating large medullary metastases, achieving rapid and sustained responses even in high-risk situations where conventional therapies may not be suitable. Furthermore, the fact that the brain metastases occurred after pathological complete response without extracranial lesions may indicate the superiority of T-DXd over conventional anti-HER2 antibodies for brain metastasis. This case underscores the potential of T-DXd as a viable treatment option for brain metastases. Further studies are required to establish its safety and efficacy in similar high-risk scenarios.",

    "title": "Highlights from ESMO 2024 as a young head and neck oncologist.",
    "abstract": "Attending the 2024 ESMO Congress as a young physician is an invaluable opportunity to establish the foundation for a successful and impactful career in oncology. This experience can be transformative for one's professional development. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024, held in Barcelona, Spain, served as a platform for the presentation and discussion of substantial advancements across various oncology disciplines. Research presented at the congress highlighted the expanding role of immunotherapy across various cancer types, including cervical, endometrial, melanoma, and bladder cancers, underscoring its potential to enhance patient outcomes. KEYNOTE-522 Trial demonstrated that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab, significantly improved overall survival in patients with high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer [1]. As a young head and neck oncologist, I found the results of the Mythos Trial particularly noteworthy. These findings underscore the potential of T-DXd in treating HER2-positive salivary gland cancers, presenting a novel approach to targeted therapy in this rare malignancy. The results may well influence future treatment guidelines and stimulate further research into HER2-targeted therapies for head and neck tumors [2]. The congress presented significant findings from the EORTC 1206-HNCG trial, focusing on salivary gland cancers (SGCs) expressing androgen receptors (ARs). The trial demonstrated that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a viable treatment option for patients with AR-expressing SGCs, offering comparable efficacy to traditional chemotherapy.These findings suggest that ADT could be considered a standard treatment approach for patients with recurrent and/ormetastatic AR-expressing salivary gland cancers, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life [3]. The EA3163 trial, which was presented at the 2024 ESMO Congress, investigated the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on organ preservation in patients with advanced sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. The study compared two treatment approaches, and the results indicated that patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a 50% chance of preserving vital structures like the eye and skull base, compared to only 15% in the standard treatment group. Notwithstanding the study's challenges in patient accrual and its failure to reach its planned enrollment, the observed data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may enhance organ preservation without compromising survival [4]. Attending ESMO as a young doctor was an enriching and inspiring experience. The exposure to cutting-edge research, networking opportunities, and practical insights significantly enhanced my knowledge and career trajectory. I would strongly recommend this congress to other young doctors aspiring to excel in oncology.",

    "title": "Perivascular Niche-Resident Alveolar Macrophages Promote Interstitial Pneumonitis Related to Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a transformative HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for treating breast cancer. Unfortunately, T-DXd has also been implicated in causing fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) in multiple clinical trials. A better understanding of the mechanistic basis of these ADC-induced adverse effects could enable development of strategies to prevent or treat T-DXd-related ILD. In this study, we determined that T-DXd-induced ILD represents an off-target adverse event rather than an on-target off-tumor adverse event. To further investigate this phenomenon, an immunocompetent murine model that recapitulates T-DXd-induced ILD events was developed, facilitating in-depth mechanistic studies. Single-cell RNA sequencing in this model implicated alveolar macrophages (AM) as the primary cell type impacted by T-DXd in the lung microenvironment. Intravital microscopy further revealed that AMs resident in perivascular niches directly engulfed blood-circulating T-DXd via Fc-Fc\u03b3R engagement. This Fc-Fc\u03b3R interaction with T-DXd triggered a phenotypic shift in AMs from an immunosuppressive to a pro-ILD state, characterized by inflammation and immune activation, mediated through the SPP1 pathways. Finally, mitigating nonspecific T-DXd uptake in the lung by preconditioning perivascular AMs with IgG1 or the parental antibody of T-DXd significantly reduced unintended ADC absorption. These findings elucidate a mechanism by which T-DXd ignites the lung immune microenvironment and underscore the importance of off-target endocytosis by innate immune cells in the development of ADC-related toxicities. Significance: Preconditioning the perivascular niche can prevent lung inflammation induced by antibody-drug conjugate phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and subsequent SPP1high macrophage differentiation, providing a clinically viable strategy for mitigating interstitial lung disease.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common primary tumor entities that develop brain metastases (BM) during disease progression. Multiple BM are associated with poorer prognosis, but various surgical, radiotherapeutic and systemic treatment approaches improve survival. We aimed to identify prognostic factors and evaluate the overall survival following BM surgery in patients with multiple BCBM. All metachronous metastasized female patients with resected BCBM at our institution between 2008 and 2019 were included. Data on clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic parameters were recorded and analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression models. Among the 93 patients included in the final analysis, 30 individuals presented with multiple BM. Compared to patients with single BM, those with multiple BM were more likely to have infratentorial BM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-10.83, p\u2009=\u20090.044), HER2(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive BC (aOR 3.93, 95% CI 1.23-12.53, p\u2009=\u20090.021) and hepatic metastases (aOR 5.86, 95% CI 1.34-25.61, p\u2009=\u20090.019). There was no significant difference in postoperative survival between individuals with multiple (median: 12.5 months) and single BM (17.0 months, p\u2009=\u20090.186). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjuvant radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 5.93, 95% CI 1.06-33.26, p\u2009=\u20090.043) and trastuzumab treatment (aHR 4.95, 95% CI 1.72-14.25, p\u2009=\u20090.003) were associated with longer postoperative survival multiple BCBM patients. BC patients with multiple BM show remarkable postoperative survival, particularly if combined with adjuvant radiotherapy. Our data justify the surgery of multiple BCBM in patients with appropriate clinical condition and feasible location of BM.",

    "title": "TROPION-Breast05: a randomized phase III study of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab versus chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-high locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Standard of care (SoC) for patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (combined positive score\u2009\u2a7e\u200910) is chemotherapy plus anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors; however, prognosis and survival for most patients is poor. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a novel antibody-drug conjugate comprising a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a plasma-stable, cleavable, tetrapeptide-based linker, has shown preliminary activity as mono or combination therapy in advanced/metastatic TNBC. TROPION-Breast05 is an ongoing randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of Dato-DXd in combination with durvalumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) versus SoC treatment in patients with PD-L1-high locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC. Patients (\u2a7e18\u2009years) will be randomized 1:1 to receive Dato-DXd (6\u2009mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3\u2009weeks (Q3W)) plus durvalumab (1120\u2009mg IV Q3W) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC; paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) plus pembrolizumab (200\u2009mg IV Q3W). In selected countries, patients will also be randomized (1:1:1) to a third arm of Dato-DXd monotherapy. The primary study endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (Dato-DXd plus durvalumab arm vs ICC plus pembrolizumab arm). Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint; other secondary endpoints include PFS (investigator-assessed), objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate at Week 24 (all assessed in the Dato-DXd plus durvalumab arm vs ICC plus pembrolizumab arm), patient-reported outcomes, and safety. The study is approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each study site. All patients will provide written informed consent. TROPION-Breast05 will assess the potential role of Dato-DXd with or without durvalumab in patients with PD-L1-high advanced or metastatic TNBC. The findings of this trial could lead to a new treatment option for these patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06103864 (Date of registration: 27 October 2023). TROPION-Breast05: A clinical study comparing datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), alone or in combination with durvalumab, versus standard-of-care treatment in people with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with cancer cells that express PD-L1 and whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. Standard treatment for people with TNBC that cannot be removed with surgery or has spread to other parts of the body and whose cancer cells express a protein called PD-L1 is chemotherapy plus anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors. However, additional treatment options are needed to improve treatment outcomes and minimize side effects. Dato-DXd, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consists of an antibody (datopotamab) linked to an anti-cancer drug (deruxtecan). The antibody attaches to a protein found on the surface of breast cancer cells called TROP2. The antibody is then taken inside the cancer cells, the anti-cancer drug is released, and the cells are killed. By releasing the anti-cancer drug inside the cell, the treatment is directed to the cancer site with the goal of minimizing side effects. In a study called TROPION-PanTumor01, 40% of people with TNBC who received Dato-DXd (and who had not previously received ADCs) had a reduction in their tumor size of at least 30%. These results were promising and it is thought that combining Dato-DXd with a PD-L1 inhibitor may make cancer cells more susceptible to being targeted by the body\u2019s immune system. In another study called BEGONIA, Dato-DXd was evaluated in combination with durvalumab, which blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. In people with TNBC, treatment with Dato-DXd and durvalumab resulted in a decrease in tumor size of at least 30% in 79% of people. The safety profile of Dato-DXd and durvalumab was tolerable and manageable; the most common D-DXd side effects were nausea and mouth sores, known as stomatitis. Based on data from TROPION-PanTumor01 and BEGONIA, the phase III TROPION-Breast05 will compare Dato-DXd alone and in combination with durvalumab vs standard-of-care treatment for people with TNBC whose cancer cells express PD-L1, and whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery, or their cancer has spread to other parts of the body.",

    "abstract": "In the era of personalized cancer therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become one of the fastest-emerging groups of anticancer drugs. ADCs consist of an antibody coupled to a cytotoxic payload by a chemical linker, designed to be cleaved off intracellularly. Understanding the intracellular trafficking and processing of ADCs is crucial for elucidating their mechanism of action. This study aimed to compare trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) to ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with emphasis on Rab GTPase-regulated intracellular trafficking and its impact on ADC efficacy. The efficacy of T-DXd and T-DM1 was assessed in a panel of HER2-positive cell lines. Correlations between ADC efficacy and the expression of HER2 and Rab GTPases were evaluated. Functional studies, including knockdown (KD), overexpression, and microscopy, were performed to evaluate the impact of Rab GTPases on ADC cytotoxicity. In contrast to T-DM1, T-DXd efficacy was found not to correlate to HER2 expression in a panel of HER2-positive cell lines. However, a correlation to RAB5A expression was found for T-DXd efficacy, although not as strong as for T-DM1. Altering the expression of RAB5 in our model system confirmed RAB5 to have an impact on both T-DXd and T-DM1 cytotoxicity, but more on T-DM1. In addition, RAB4a was found to influence T-DXd sensitivity, but not T-DM1, indicating differences in intracellular processing between T-DXd and T-DM1. The study demonstrates that ADC design significantly influences intracellular trafficking and processing. The linker design, in particular, plays a major role in determining the intracellular fate of an ADC.",

    "abstract": "Development of antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), has improved the outcomes of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. We compared the association between peripheral blood biomarkers and outcomes in patients with breast cancer treated with T-DM1 and T-DXd. Eighty-five women treated with T-DM1 (n\u2009=\u200940) or T-DXd (n\u2009=\u200945) for advanced disease were evaluated. Overall survival (OS) and OS after the end of treatment (EOT) were compared based on changes in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between baseline and EOT. In the T-DM1 group, patients with a low NLR at EOT had significantly longer OS after EOT than those with a high NLR (p\u2009=\u20090.007), and patients with a high ALC at EOT had longer OS after EOT (p\u2009=\u20090.071). In the T-DXd group, the ALC and NLR were not associated with OS. The exploratory subgroup analysis suggested that patients with high ALC at EOT had better OS after EOT (p\u2009=\u20090.038) in the T-DXd (HER2-low) group (n\u2009=\u200919), whereas ALC and NLR were not associated with the outcome in the T-DXd (HER2-positive) group (n\u2009=\u200926). Multivariable analysis revealed that the NLR at EOT was an independent prognostic factor for OS after EOT, after adjusting for clinicopathological factors, in the T-DM1 group (p\u2009=\u20090.019). Immune status may influence treatment outcomes in the T-DM1 and T-DXd (HER2-low) groups. Conversely, in the T-DXd (HER2-positive) group, the treatment outcome was independent of immune status.",

Key eligibility criteria include BCBM of all subtypes, age \u226518, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performace Status (ECOG-PS)\u22642 with \u226410 brain metastases. Treatment was initiated with a dose of nivolumab (480\u2009mg intravenously) that was repeated every 4 weeks. The initial dose of nivolumab was followed 1\u2009week later by SRS. Blood was collected at baseline and every 4 weeks for flow cytometry and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assessment. A total of 12 patients received SRS to 17 brain metastases. Breast cancer subtypes included triple negative (50%), hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- (33%), and HR-/HER2+ (17%). Median follow-up from start of protocol therapy is 56 months. No cases of radionecrosis were noted. Two lesions were noted to undergo local failure, both pathologically confirmed, for a 12-month local control of 94%. Median distant intracranial control was 7.4 months with a 12-month control rate of 33%. Median systemic progression-free survival was 7.7 months with a 12-month rate of 42%.

    "title": "Association of statin use on survival outcomes of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer in the APHINITY trial.",
    "abstract": "There is evidence that statins might improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer. The role of statins in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer is unknown. Therefore, we explored the association between statin use and survival outcomes in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients in the phase III APHINITY trial (adjuvant pertuzumab/trastuzumab). All patients (intent-to-treat population, n\u2009=\u20094804) were included (6.2\u00a0years median follow-up database). The primary objective was to investigate the association of statin use on invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), distant relapse-free interval (DRFI), and overall survival (OS). Patients who received statins at baseline, or started statins within 1\u00a0year from randomization were considered statin users. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used a Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis. Overall, 423 (8.8%) patients were classified as statin users. They were older, more often postmenopausal, had a higher body mass index, more often diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia, had smaller sized tumors, were treated more often with breast conserving surgery, and less often with anthracycline-containing regimens. Overall, 508 IDFS events (12.8% among statin users and 10.4% among non-statin users) and 272 deaths (8.5% and 5.4%, respectively) occurred. In multivariate analysis, statin use was not associated with IDFS (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.80-1.52), DRFI (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.81) nor OS (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.78-1.73). In APHINITY, statin use was not associated with improved survival outcomes. These results must be interpreted with caution due to the exploratory nature of the analysis and the associated limitations.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common and deadly female-specific malignancy in the world. Four immunohistochemical subtypes are distinguished: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple-negative. In turn, the HER2-positive subtype presents two variants depending on the status of the hormone receptors. The variant that expresses them can benefit from both anti-HER2 and anti-hormonal therapy. Today, MCTP finds application in maintenance therapy after standard of care and in advanced breast cancer when the patient's clinical condition is already seriously compromised by metastatic disease; in this context, it is used as a first-line treatment, in pre-treated subjects, or as a rescue treatment. Here, the use of adjuvant oral MCTP after surgery at an early stage in HER-2 and hormone-positive local breast cancer is proposed, where effective treatment options are available, such as anti-HER2 therapy (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab), anti-hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, letrozole), radiotherapy, and, in case of strong PD-1 positivity, immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer, the second-most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women, remains a significant global health challenge. This study focuses on developing trastuzumab (TmAb)-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) co-loaded with carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for targeted treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The NPs were prepared via the ionic gelation method, optimized using Design of Experimentation (DoE), and characterized for particle size, zeta potential, PDI, and entrapment efficiency. TmAb conjugation was achieved using NHS and EDC, and further characterization included TEM, syringeability, hemolytic toxicity, in-vitro release, ex-vivo cell line study, and in-vivo anti-cancer activity using the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) model. The in-vitro release studies indicated enhanced drug release at pH 5.5 over 32 h and showed first-order kinetics. The TmAb-conjugated NPs demonstrated specificity and targeting in the SK-BR-3 cell line and significant anti-cancer activity in the EAC model, with the highest tumor inhibition rate of 85.19% compared to 58.12% for the drug solution. These findings highlight the potential of TmAb-conjugated NPs for targeted breast cancer therapy, offering improved drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy, paving the way for future clinical applications to reduce side effects and overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Anti-HER2 antibodies are effective but often lead to resistance in patients with HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we report an epigenetic crosstalk with aberrant glycerophospholipid metabolism and inflammation as a key resistance mechanism of anti-HER2 therapies in HER2+ breast cancer. Histone reader ZMYND8 specifically confers resistance to cancer cells against trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 enhances cPLA2\u03b1 expression in resistant tumor cells through inducing c-Myc. cPLA2\u03b1 inactivates phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C to inhibit phosphatidylcholine breakdown into diacylglycerol, which diminishes protein kinase C activity leading to interleukin-27 secretion. Supplementation with interleukin-27 protein counteracts cPLA2\u03b1 loss to reinforce trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ tumor cells and patient-derived organoids. Upregulation of ZMYND8, c-Myc, cPLA2\u03b1, and IL-27 is prevalent in HER2+ breast cancer patients following HER2-targeted therapies. Targeting c-Myc or cPLA2\u03b1 effectively overcomes anti-HER2 therapy resistance in patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, this study uncovers a druggable signaling cascade that drives resistance to HER2-targeted therapies in HER2+ breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "In advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, the standard taxane-trastuzumab-pertuzumab (THP) regimen faces competition from new therapies, emphasizing the need for biomarkers to guide treatment. This study evaluates the HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA score as a prognostic predictor, aiming to tailor treatment strategies. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients treated with the THP regimen between 2010 and 2024. The HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA score was categorized as low (n\u2009=\u200914), medium (n\u2009=\u200920), or high (n\u2009=\u200960), and its correlation with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox regression models. The median follow-up was 31.5 months. Patients with ERBB2-high scores had significantly better median PFS (33.9 vs. 10.6 months, hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0.69, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and OS (not reached vs. 30.8 months, HR\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI: 0.13-0.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to ERBB2-low patients. Based on these findings, further validation of this biomarker in tumor samples from the CLEOPATRA phase III trial is ongoing, which could help optimize treatment strategies in this population.",

After the positive results of KEYNOTE-024, pembrolizumab was approved in a first-line setting for patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 \u2265 50%. A small number of patients had a durable response to immunotherapy, and so far it has not been discovered who will benefit. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression in a real-world setting. We enrolled 35 patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC who had PD-L1 \u2265 50%. Progression-free survival was 9 months, 95% CI (2.6-15.4). Overall survival was 14 months, 95% CI (0-28.5). Five-year OS rate for the whole group of patients was 20%, and the six-year OS rate was 17.2%. Immunotherapy was a revolution in the treatment of NSCLC. We still do not know which patients will benefit from immunotherapy, but patients who do respond may experience long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the comparative effectiveness and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy versus trastuzumab and chemotherapy for patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in Canada. We conducted a population-based retrospective study of patients receiving first-line treatment for mBC across eight Canadian provinces. Patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy were historical comparators, and patients receiving pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy were the treatment group. Patients were followed until death or up to 5\u2009years following the start of treatment (maximum follow-up to December 31, 2019). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). One-year cumulative incidence and RDs were calculated for safety outcomes including hospitalization, emergency department visits, febrile neutropenia, and cardiac-related events. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were applied within provinces. Individual provincial survival estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. 3063 patients who received first-line treatment for mBC were identified. Median OS was higher among treatment patients compared to comparator patients in most provinces. Pertuzumab was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of mortality (pooled HRs, PSM: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.57-0.74; IPTW: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.61-0.70). The treatment group had a lower risk of hospitalization compared to the comparator group (pooled RD: -0.05, 95% CI: [-0.09]-[-0.01]). No difference in 1-year cumulative incidence of cardiac-related events was identified between groups. Pertuzumab use in practice was associated with statistically significant improved survival without apparent safety concerns among patients with mBC. Real-world evaluations allow for assessments of publicly funded treatments to inform funding policies.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with high metastatic potential, poor prognosis, and the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The lack of these receptors limits the standard treatments, such as hormone therapies and HER2-targeted antibodies like trastuzumab. These challenges highlight the critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. CD147, a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in TNBC, promotes tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance, making it a promising therapeutic target. This study evaluates the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of HuM6-1B9, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, against MDA-MB-231 cells, a TNBC model. CFSE-labelled MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with PBMCs as effector cells (E:T ratio 80:1) in the presence of HuM6-1B9 and incubated for 4 h. Cells were then collected and stained with PI, and CFSE+/PI+ dead target cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Co-culturing MDA-MB-231 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of HuM6-1B9 demonstrated effective ADCC induction without direct cytotoxicity. HuM6-1B9 induced 54.01% cancer cell death via ADCC, significantly outperforming trastuzumab (26.14%) while sparing PBMCs. These findings support HuM6-1B9 as a prospective TNBC therapeutic and warrant further investigation into its clinical potential.",

No cases of ILD have been reported with Sacituzumab-Govitecan (TROP-2 target) or Tusamitamab-Ravtansine (CEACAM5 target).

Current studies are focusing on the combination of ADC and immunotherapy, although there are few data now available on pulmonary toxicity profiles. Among the many ADCs being developed, several can cause ILD of varying grades and intensity. Knowledge of their risks, diagnostic and therapeutic modalities is required in order to quickly detect and treat ADC-induced ILD.",

    "abstract": "Medical advancements in breast cancer are truly remarkable. Especially in recent years, numerous new therapeutics have been approved and surgical strategies have been de-escalated for specific patient groups. In the therapeutic setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors as oral maintenance therapy in early breast cancer and immune checkpoint inhibitors (Pembrolizumab) for triple-negative breast cancer (BC) are noteworthy. In the surgical field, prospective randomized controlled trials have currently explored the possibility to deescalate axillary surgery by omitting sentinel lymph node excision (INSEMA, SOUND). As a result, there have been significant improvements in prognosis and a reduction in surgical morbidity for patients. Many exciting trials are underway, and it remains to be seen whether antibody-drug conjugates beyond trastuzumab emtansine, will find their way into the treatment lines for early-stage BC. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence in both diagnostics and treatment recommendation evaluation is a promising area with great potential.",

    "abstract": "Dual anti-HER2 drugs has become the standard regimen for neoadjuvant systematic treatment (NST) to HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, the efficacy varies greatly among patients with different HER2 protein expression levels. A total of 575 HER2-positive breast cancer patients from multiple centers throughout China from 2013 to 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. We compared clinicopathological features in different HER2 IHC classes (HER2 2+ISH+ or HER2 3+), and their difference in response to NST and survival with single or dual anti-HER2 drugs. Drug sensitivity assays were used to evaluate different efficacy of anti-HER2 drugs in vitro. Compared to HER2 3+ subgroup, the HER2 2+ISH+ group had a higher proportion of HR+ status (48.7% vs. 76.1%; p < 0.001), more HER2 protein loss after NST, lower pCR rate (46.07% vs. 16.24%; p < 0.001), and tended to have worse DFS. In HER2 2+ISH+ patients, treated with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination had no significant improvement in pCR (19.12% vs. 12.24%; p=0.287) and DFS (p=0.908) than using alone. Drug sensitivity assay showed poor efficacy with dual anti-HER2 drugs in HER2 2+ISH+ cell lines, however, T-Dxd drugs had a satisfactory effect. Owing to the differences in clinicopathological features and treatment efficacy, we considered the HER2 2+ISH+ group to be a distinct subtype and defined it as the HER2-moderate-positive (HER2-mod) subgroup. In this subgroup, dual anti-HER2 drugs did not exert significant improvement in pCR and DFS. Therefore, treatment optimization is warranted, with ADC drugs as potential options.",

A comprehensive evaluation of the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of these therapies is imperative for optimizing therapeutic strategies and enhancing patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of T-DM1 against pyrotinib plus capecitabine. Patients are females with HER2-positive, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer who at least 18 years old and have received anti-HER2 therapy in the past. This study included 148 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of these, 74 patients received intravenous T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg) every 21 days, while the other 74 patients got oral pyrotinib (400 mg, once daily) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m The median PFS was 12.2 months for the pyrotinib group vs 9.1 months for the T-DM1 group. The median follow-up was 12.7 months for pyrotinib and 9.3 months for T-DM1. The pyrotinib group had better DCR (56.8% vs 54.1%) and ORR (40.5% vs 29.7%). While adverse events were manageable, the most common severe AE in the pyrotinib group was diarrhea (24.3%), and in the T-DM1 group, it was thrombocytopenia (16.2%). However, by reducing the drug dosage or providing symptomatic treatment, most adverse events could be controlled at grades 1 to 2, indicating that the adverse events were manageable. Neither group recorded any adverse event-related deaths. Pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improves median PFS compared to T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, demonstrating a favorable efficacy profile alongside manageable safety concerns.",

The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of trastuzumab-associated CTRCD in a contemporary cohort with HER2-positive breast cancer and assess the performance of a risk assessment tool to identify patients at low risk for CTRCD to guide risk-based surveillance strategies. A retrospective cohort of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab at a tertiary cancer center was examined.

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that HER2 protein expression and hormone receptor (HoR) status affect the sensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer to neoadjuvant therapy, but it is unclear if sensitivity varies among subgroups defined by HER2 and HoR status. We examined 2 cohorts of patients, aged 18 to 80 years, with HER2-positive early breast cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2022: cohort 1 included 2648 patients, and cohort 2 had 141 patients with RNA expression data. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on immunohistochemical HER2 and HoR status: HER2(3+)/HoR-, HER2(3+)/HoR+, HER2(2+)/HoR-, and HER2(2+)/HoR+. We evaluated total pathological complete response (TpCR, defined as ypT0/is ypN0) rates, disease-free survival (DFS), and variations in PAM50 intrinsic subtypes across different subgroups. In cohort 1, HER2(3+)/HoR- had a higher TpCR rate (44.5%) than HER2(3+)/HoR+ (33.8%) (P < .001), HER2(2+)/HoR- (31.7%) (P\u00a0= .013), and HER2(2+)/HoR+ (13.8%) (P < .001). DFS was similar across groups (P\u00a0= .445). Trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab significantly improved TpCR rates and DFS in HER2(3+)/HoR- and HER2(3+)/HoR+ but not in HER2(2+)/HoR- and HER2(2+)/HoR+. Cohort 2 showed significant PAM50 subtype differences across these groups (P < .001). In conclusion, the responsiveness of HER2-positive breast cancer to neoadjuvant targeted therapy is significantly influenced by HER2 expression levels and HoR status, emphasizing the necessity of precision medicine approaches to tailor therapeutic strategies for improved clinical outcomes.",

Common treatments following surgical resection include PD-1-targeting checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab), as 20% of tumors are PD-L1 positive with or without systemic chemotherapy. Over the last several years, our laboratory has developed nano-immune conjugates (NIC) in which hydrophobic chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel (PTX) and SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, are made water soluble by formulating them into albumin-based nanoparticles (nab) that are hydrophobically linked to various IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, creating an antigen-targetable nano-immune conjugate. To date, we have successfully tested PTX containing NICs linked to either VEGF- or CD20-targeted antibodies in two phase I clinical trials against multiple relapsed ovarian/uterine cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. Herein, we describe a novel NIC created with either PTX or SN38 that is coated with anti-PD-L1-targeting antibodies for the treatment of a preclinical model of TNBC. In vitro testing suggests that the chemotherapy drug and antibody retain their toxicity and ligand binding capability in the context of the NIC. Furthermore, both the PTX and SN-38 NIC demonstrate superior anti-tumor efficacy relative to antibody and chemotherapy drugs alone in a PD-L1 + MDA-MB-231 human TNBC xenograft model, which could translate clinically to patients with TNBC.",

    "title": "Low serum neopterin early indicates durable benefits of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab therapy in advanced lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is a state of immunological imbalance associated with chronic inflammation and local immunosuppression. Introducing immune checkpoint inhibitors was a breakthrough in cancer treatment. However, the treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory, and many patients still progress after the initial response. The study aimed to assess whether serum neopterin (NEO), an indicator of cellular immune activation, could be used as a predictor of the long-term benefits of drugs blocking the programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs). We enrolled 103 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1s. Serum was collected at baseline and at the end of each treatment cycle for the first three months of immunotherapy. NEO concentrations were determined with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay and correlated with treatment outcomes. Low-NEO status (i.e., serum NEO levels\u2009\u2264\u200971.65 nM at the end of the 3rd treatment cycle and\u2009\u2264\u200966.84 nM at the end of the 4th treatment cycle) increased the odds of\u2009\u2265\u200912-month benefits (odds ratio, OR\u2009=\u200911.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and decreased the hazard of NSCLC progression (hazard ratio, HR\u2009=\u20090.327, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and treatment failure (adjusted HR\u2009=\u20090.450, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Patients with low-NEO status had three times longer progression-free survival (PFS, 17.3 vs. 5.9 months) and three times longer time to treatment failure (TTF, 16.3 vs. 5.5 months) compared to other patients. Baseline NEO levels could not discriminate between patients who had and lacked the long-term benefits of treatment. In conclusion, the on-treatment serum NEO concentrations could be a biomarker of the long-term benefits of the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in advanced NSCLC.",

It highlights advancements in ADC design, mechanisms of action, and key outcomes from recent clinical trials. ADCs have introduced a new level of precision in oncology by targeting tumor-specific antigens such as HER2, HER3, and TROP-2. Recent clinical trials of agents like trastuzumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan have demonstrated meaningful objective response rates and manageable toxicity, offering hope for patients with advanced NSCLC and SCLC. ADCs are transforming the treatment landscape for lung cancer, offering a blend of targeted delivery and potent therapeutic effects.

Emerging evidence suggests a potential association between elevated body mass index (BMI) and enhanced ICI efficacy, yet this relationship remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation. This study aims to evaluate the impact of BMI on treatment efficacy and survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients treated with first-line ICI therapy. A retrospective study was conducted at a multi-center registry to evaluate the impact of baseline BMI on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with stage IV NSCLC who received first-line ICI therapies. Treatment regimens included pembrolizumab or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, administered either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, at the oncology department between January 2018 and December 2023. BMI was categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and OS and PFS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Among 346 patients, 12.72% were underweight, 45.38% normal weight, 29.19% overweight, and 12.72% obese. Overweight and obese patients were more likely to receive pembrolizumab ( BMI was not an independent predictor of survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC treated with ICI.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates, particularly trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), have emerged as effective therapies for various solid tumours. Clinical trials show that T-DXd improves survival in both HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer patients. Additionally, it improves survival in HER2-positive gastro-oesophageal cancer and elicits objective responses in HER2-low tumours. Responses have also been noted in lung and gynaecological cancers with HER2 expression, although subgroup analyses for HER2-low cases are lacking. This review assesses HER2 protein expression levels and gene amplification across solid tumours where T-DXd shows potential benefits. We focus on the accuracy and limitations of HER2 testing methods, particularly for identifying HER2-low cancer. A semi-systematic approach was employed, searching EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane, and PubMed databases. We calculated median incidences of HER2-positive, HER2-low, and HER2-0 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 amplification by in situ hybridisation (ISH). A total of 144 studies were included, covering breast (n=57), gastro-oesophageal (n=33), lung (n=17), gynaecological (n=24), and various other carcinomas (n=13). The median incidences of HER2-low were 52%, 16%, 58%, and 17% in breast, gastro-oesophageal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, respectively, with unknown incidences in lung and cervical cancers. Factors influencing HER2-low detection include tumour heterogeneity, antibody clones, observer variability, and lack of validated scoring criteria. Given the significant proportion of HER2-low cases, many patients could benefit from T-DXd, but limitations in detection accuracy necessitate further research and standardisation in diagnostic methods and criteria to advance the clinical utility of T-DXd for HER2-low tumours.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation cancer immunotherapies aim to improve patient outcomes by combining inhibitory signal blockade with targeted T-cell costimulation in tumor and lymphoid tissues. Acasunlimab (DuoBody-PD-L1\u00d74-1BB) is an investigational, bispecific antibody designed to elicit an antitumor immune response via conditional 4-1BB activation strictly dependent on simultaneous programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) binding. Since 4-1BB is coexpressed with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) on CD8 The effect of acasunlimab and pembrolizumab combination was analyzed in vitro using functional immune cell assays, including mixed-lymphocyte reactions and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. The antitumor activity of the combination was tested in vivo in (1) MC38, MB49, Pan02, and B16F10 syngeneic tumor models using acasunlimab and anti-PD-1 mouse-surrogate antibodies; and (2) triple knock-in mice expressing the human targets using an acasunlimab chimeric antibody (chi-acasunlimab) and pembrolizumab. The mechanism of action of the combination was investigated in the MC38 syngeneic model through immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA sequencing. The combination reinvigorated dysfunctional T cells in vitro, while also potentiating T-cell expansion, interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon gamma secretion and cytotoxic activity. In vivo, the combination of chi-acasunlimab and pembrolizumab or mouse-surrogate antibodies potentiated antitumor activity and survival in the humanized knock-in and multiple syngeneic mouse models, leading to durable complete tumor regressions in the MC38 model consistent with therapeutic synergy. Mechanistically, the combination enhanced clonal expansion of tumor-specific CD8 These preclinical results demonstrate that conditional 4-1BB stimulation combined with complete PD-1 blockade enhances antitumor immunity through complementary mechanisms. The acasunlimab and pembrolizumab combination is being evaluated in Phase 2 (NCT05117242) and pivotal Phase 3 (NCT06635824) trials in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after checkpoint inhibitor therapy failure.",

    "abstract": "There are three categories of drugs that treat human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare the adverse reactions of three classes of anti-HER-2 drugs to various body systems in patients based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). All data reports were extracted from the FAERS between 2004 and 2024. Data mining of adverse events associated with anti-HER-2 drugs was carried out using disproportionality analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the risk factors associated with AEs leading to hospitalization. A total of 47,799 patients were screened for the three classes of drugs, among which ADC drugs caused the largest proportion of deaths. MAb has the strongest ADR signals associated with \"cardiac disorders\". Moreover, trastuzumab was associated with a greater risk of cardiotoxicity. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the treatment with mAbs should be wary of serious adverse reactions in \"infections and infestations\" and \"metabolism and nutrition disorders\". Moreover, \"endocrine disorders\" were the factor associated with the highest risk of prolonged hospitalization due to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). The safety of tucatinib among TKI drugs is greater than that of other drugs. In general, from the perspective of the effects of the three classes of drugs on the various body systems of patients, we should focus on mAb-associated \"cardiac disorders\", ADC-associated \"hepatobiliary disorders\", \"respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\", and TKI-associated \"gastrointestinal disorders.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a transformative approach in breast cancer therapy, offering targeted treatment with reduced toxicity by selectively delivering cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. While ADCs like trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan have shown significant efficacy, resistance mechanisms such as antigen loss, impaired internalization, and efflux of cytotoxic payloads challenge their effectiveness. This review discusses these resistance mechanisms and explores advanced strategies to overcome them, including innovations in linker chemistry, multi-antigen targeting, and biomarker-driven personalization. Additionally, therapeutic sequencing - determining the optimal order of ADCs with other treatments such as chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy - is examined as a crucial approach to maximize ADC efficacy and manage resistance. Evidence-based sequencing strategies, particularly for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are supported by clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of ADCs in both early-stage and metastatic settings. The potential of combination therapies, such as ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), further highlights the evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment. As ADC technology advances, personalized approaches integrating biomarkers and optimized sequencing protocols offer promising avenues to enhance treatment outcomes and combat resistance in breast cancer.",

    "title": "Recent Advances in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "While immunotherapy has transformed treatment across various cancers, its impact on breast cancer is relatively limited. Recent advances have established immunotherapy as an effective approach for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic targets and poor prognosis. Specifically, pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), is now approved for both first-line metastatic and early-stage TNBC. In metastatic TNBC, combining ICIs with chemotherapy, particularly pembrolizumab, has demonstrated survival benefits in patients with PD-L1-positive disease. However, extending these benefits to broader populations has proven challenging, highlighting the need for better patient selection and novel strategies. Emerging approaches include combining ICIs with antibody-drug conjugates, PARP inhibitors, dual ICIs, and bispecific antibodies targeting angiogenesis and immune checkpoints. These strategies aim to overcome resistance and expand immunotherapy's efficacy beyond the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In early-stage disease, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has significantly improved pathologic complete response, event-free survival, and overall survival, establishing a new standard of care. Ongoing research aims to determine the optimal timing for ICI administration, explore less toxic chemotherapy backbones, utilize biomarkers for personalized treatment, and assess whether adding complementary treatments, such as radiation therapy for high-risk cases, can improve outcomes. This review examines the successes and setbacks of ICI use in TNBC, offering a comprehensive overview of current practices and future directions. It emphasizes optimizing ICI timing, leveraging biomarkers, and integrating novel agents to refine treatment approaches for both metastatic and early-stage TNBC. As immunotherapy continues to evolve, future research must address the unmet needs of this challenging breast cancer subtype, offering hope for improved outcomes.",

The advent of highly effective HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates with clinical activity at low levels of HER2 expression, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, has necessitated the re-evaluation of HER2 testing, particularly for HER2-low tumours. In this Review, we provide an in-depth overview of the evolution of HER2 testing, the current clinical guidelines for HER2 testing across various solid tumours, challenges associated with current testing methodologies and the emerging potential of quantitative techniques. We discuss the importance of accurately defining HER2-low expression for therapeutic decision-making and how newer diagnostic approaches, such as quantitative immunofluorescence and RNA-based assays, might address the limitations of traditional immunohistochemistry-based methods. As the use of HER2-targeted therapies continues to expand to a wider range of tumour types, ensuring the precision and accuracy of HER2 testing will be crucial for guiding treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "With treatment options for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) expanding, updated assessments of contemporary treatment patterns and clinical outcomes are needed. This study aimed to conduct such an assessment using data from real-world oncology practices. Adult HER2+ mBC patients initiating first-line (1L) treatment from January 2013 to January 2021 (index date) were selected from the US Flatiron Health database and followed through January 2022. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns were summarized. Clinical outcomes were examined using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Among 2074 HER2+ mBC patients with at least 1 line of therapy (LoT), median age was 61 years and 62.8% had known hormone receptor-positive disease. During a median follow-up of 26.0 months, 1159 (55.8%) had at least 2 LoTs, and 584 (28.2%) had 3 or more. The most common 1L regimens included docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (THP; 38.9%) followed by THP+ platinum agent (7.5%) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) monotherapy (6.1%). By the end of follow up, 18.1% of patients remained on treatment, 20.2% died, and 5.8% discontinued without starting a new treatment. Median overall survival from 1L start was 40.3 months. Approximately one-quarter of the patients died or discontinued 1L therapy without receiving further treatment. Overall survival from the start of 1L was just over 3 years. This highlights a need for more effective therapies in earlier LoTs that prolong the time to progression and provide longer clinical benefits.",

A 68 years old woman presented due to right breast mass was diagnosed with hormonal receptor-negative, HER2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab was started. After 12 courses of chemotherapy, CT scan revealed disappearance of the right breast tumor and infiltrating shadow in the left lower lung field. Sputum polymerase chain reaction test for tuberculosis was positive. Anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy was started. Four days after starting isoniazid, partial mastectomy was performed under local anesthesia and radiation therapy for the breast was omitted. There are no signs of recurrence of breast cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis for 5 years. Chemotherapy for breast cancer and premedication with corticosteroid may have inhibited cellular immunity, causing endogenous relapse of tuberculosis.",

Recent studies of trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, have explored the spectrum of HER2 expression in tumors categorized as HER2-negative, including HER2-low (IHC 1+, IHC 2+/ISH-) and HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining). Clinical relevance of HER2-low and HER2-ultralow is reinforced by encouraging efficacy findings in these populations. To assess HER2-low and HER2-ultralow scoring performance by pathologists, and compare real-world HER2-low scoring with centralized scoring by trained pathologists. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer samples stained by the VENTANA anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody (Roche) assay were selected to ensure adequate representation across all HER2 IHC scores (N\u2009=\u2009500). Samples were rescored in a central laboratory by three pathologists trained in HER2-low scoring, and a majority consensus generated. Agreement between consensus and historical real-world HER2 scores was assessed by Fleiss' kappa across HER2 scores (IHC 0, 1+, 2+, 3+). Substantial agreement was observed among central pathologists across HER2 scores (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.69), for the HER2-low cutoff (IHC 0 vs. IHC 1+, 2+, 3+; \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.79), and the HER2-ultralow cutoff (IHC 0 absent membrane staining vs. IHC 0 with membrane staining, 1+, 2+, 3+; \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.68). Substantial agreement was observed between real-world pathologists and central consensus for the HER2-low cutoff (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.72). Pathologists can reproducibly score HER2-low and HER2-ultralow when supported by training. Findings may aid decision-making for patients with breast cancer who are potentially eligible for HER2-directed therapy.",

We hypothesized that HER2 and immune-based biomarkers would be predictive of pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative trastuzumab/pertuzumab (HP). Patients with stage II/III, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer received neoadjuvant HP in the TBCRC026 clinical trial. The pCR after receiving HP alone was 22% (18/83). Tumor biopsies were performed at baseline. Secondary correlative objectives were to determine the relationship between HER2-based biomarkers and immune processes with pCR. NanoString code sets BC360 and IO360 were used to compare differential gene expression in baseline tumors that underwent pCR versus no pCR. NanoString GeoMx digital spatial profiling was used to assess immune protein abundance in intraepithelial and stromal segments.

    "abstract": "Approximately one-third of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer experienced recurrence within 10 years after receiving 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab. The ExteNET study showed that 1 year of extended adjuvant neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy could reduce invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) events compared with placebo. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib, an irreversible pan-HER receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk, HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer. This multicenter phase II trial was conducted at 23 centers in China. After enrollment, patients received 1 year of extended adjuvant pyrotinib (400 mg/day), which should be initiated within 6 months after the completion of 1-year adjuvant therapy (trastuzumab alone or plus pertuzumab). The primary endpoint was 2-year iDFS rate. Between January 2019 and February 2022, 141 eligible women were enrolled and treated. As of October 10, 2022, the median follow-up was 24 (interquartile range, 18.0-34.0) months. The 2-year iDFS rate was 94.59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.97-97.38) in all patients, 94.90% (95% CI: 86.97-98.06) in patients who completed 1-year treatment, 90.32% (95% CI: 72.93-96.77) in patients who completed only 6-month treatment, 96.74% (95% CI: 87.57-99.18) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup, 92.77% (95% CI: 83.48-96.93) in the HR-negative subgroup, 96.88% (95% CI: 79.82-99.55) in the lymph node-negative subgroup, 93.85% (95% CI: 86.81-97.20) in the lymph node-positive subgroup, 97.30% (95% CI: 82.32-99.61) in patients with adjuvant trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 93.48% (95% CI: 86.06-97.02) in patients with adjuvant trastuzumab. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (79.4%), fatigue (36.9%), lymphocyte count decreased (36.9%), nausea (33.3%), and hand-foot syndrome (33.3%). Extended adjuvant pyrotinib administrated after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy showed promising efficacy in patients with high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER2, exhibiting significant clinical efficacy in breast cancer (BC) with varying HER2 expression, including HER2-low and HER2-ultralow. However, the precise mechanism underlying its efficacy and the contribution of immune activation in these settings remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that T-DXd efficacy in HER2-low and HER2-negative BC is independent of HER2 engagement and ADC internalization. Instead, its activity relies on extracellular proteases, such as cathepsin L (CTSL), within the tumor microenvironment. Irrespective of their HER2 status, tumor and stromal compartments of invasive BC abundantly express CTSL, which efficiently cleaves the specialized linker of T-DXd, facilitating payload release and inducing cytotoxicity against HER2-low/negative tumors. In HER2-positive BC, the antibody backbone of T-DXd engages Fc\u03b3-receptors and drives antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Concurrently, its cytotoxic payload (DXd) induces immunogenic cell death, further activating myeloid cells via TLR4 and STING pathways to enhance tumor antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. Notably, T-DXd cytotoxicity also upregulates tumor CD47 expression, dampening immune activation. Combining T-DXd with CD47 checkpoint blockade significantly enhances anti-tumor immune responses in a HER2-transgenic BC mouse model, while also inducing durable CD8+ T cell memory to prevent tumor recurrence after therapy cessation.",

    "abstract": "ERBB2 (HER2) alterations, including mutations, amplifications, and overexpression are emerging therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite recent advancements, standard first-line therapy remains chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. Several therapies targeting HER2 are under development and have been evaluated in clinical trials with inconsistent efficacy, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates. A major landmark was recently reached when trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate, became the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy for pretreated HER2-mutant NSCLC, following the promising efficacy demonstrated in the DESTINY-Lung trials. Furthermore, T-DXd has shown efficacy across various tumor types harboring HER2 alterations in the DESTINY-PanTumor trials, leading to its recent pan-tumor FDA approval for HER2-positive solid tumors, highlighting the potential of tumor-agnostic drug development strategies. In this review, the authors describe the different HER2 alterations and their clinical consequences, including their impact on prognosis and response to standard therapies. They provide an up-to-date overview of the current treatment landscape and add a comprehensive review of pivotal and ongoing clinical trials of HER2-targeted therapies, including tumor-agnostic drug development strategies.",

We identified specific pathogenic mutations in the dimerization domains II and IV of the HER2 receptor that contribute to treatment resistance. Mutations G309A, S310Y, and P523S induce significant structural alterations, disrupting crucial HER2:HER2 binding pockets. HER3-preferring mutants exhibited increased HER2:HER3 interactions, as confirmed by proximity ligation assay in HER2-low and HER2-high cell lines. G309A, S310Y, and P523S mutations induced a receptor switch, altering downstream signaling from ERK to AKT activation, leading to high insensitivity to trastuzumab or neratinib in cell survival and migration assays, which was further confirmed by bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic tumors expressing the P523S mutation. This study identifies new hotspot mutations in HER2 domains II and IV causing trastuzumab resistance.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that is an effective therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its efficacy is limited by drug resistance. While multiple mechanisms of resistance have been proposed, these are not yet well understood. Greater understanding of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance could provide new combination strategies to overcome resistance or predictive biomarkers to guide therapy. We have conducted CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomics modifier screens in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines to allow for unbiased discovery of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance genes. Whole-genome knockout screens were carried out in MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated with T-DM1 and its payload cytotoxin DM1. Hits were validated in secondary T-DM1 screens using a focused single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library and subsequently by individual gene knockout. The whole-genome CRISPR screens with T-DM1 and DM1 identified 599 genes as potential modifiers of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance. Of these, 17 genes were significantly enriched and 3 genes depleted at P\u2009<\u20090.001 in either or both MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 libraries in the secondary screens. Among the top hits, were known T-DM1 sensitivity genes ERBB2 and SLC46A3, in addition to negative regulators of mTOR complex 1: TSC1 and TSC2. MDA-MB-453 clones with knockout of TSC1 or partial knockout of TSC2 were more resistant to T-DM1 than wild type cells in competition growth assays and to T-DM1 and other HER2 targeting therapies (T-DXd, lapatinib and neratinib) in growth inhibition assays, and had increased internalisation of T-DM1 at 6\u00a0h. T-DM1 and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus demonstrated synergistic activity at inhibiting cell proliferation at multiple T-DM1 concentrations across four HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines. Our CRISPR screening approach with T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines identified genes not previously implicated in T-DM1 sensitivity or resistance, including TSC1 and TSC2. These genes may inform new strategies to enhance T-DM1 therapy in the clinic.",

A total of 13 Turkish centers participated in the study between September 2019 and October 2024. Patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer who underwent surgery after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with HER2-targeted therapies had residual invasive disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes and received adjuvant TDM1 therapy. The patients' files were retrospectively scanned from the hospitals' archives. The study included 79 female patients. The 36-month median disease-free survival rate was 92%, and the 36-month median overall survival rate was 85%. Neoadjuvant anthracyclines were administered to 93.6% of the patients. All patients received neoadjuvant trastuzumab and 86.1% of patients received neoadjuvant pertuzumab in addition to trastuzumab. Twelve (15.2%) patients developed progression during or after adjuvant TDM1 therapy. The most common adverse events were grade 1 fatigue (34.2%), grade 1 anemia (27.8%), and grade 1 AST increase (25.3%). Toxicity of grade 3 or above developed in five (5%) patients. TDM1 was stopped for one patient due to thrombocytopenia and for two patients due to cardiotoxicity. This study describes the sociodemographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy and provides real-life data on treatment with adjuvant TDM1. The findings support the manageable safety profile of the adjuvant TDM1 regimen with a low discontinuation rate.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has made a significant improvement in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has a role in boosting the immune system, so it can fight cancer cells. Sometimes, this mechanism can lead to an overstimulation or misdirection of immune response, so it can act against the body itself. One of the organs most affected by this reaction is the thyroid gland, and there is no definitive explanation of the causes of this adverse event. In this retrospective observational study, we enrolled 103 patients with NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression (>= 50%) who were treated in our Clinic for pulmonology, University Clinical Center of Serbia, using Pembrolizumab as the first-line therapy. Data analysis showed that 41 (39.81%) of 103 patients in our study had an adverse event of immunotherapy, and 21 of them had autoimmune thyroiditis (20.39%). Of all the patients, 19 of them were treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before the onset of Pembrolizumab. During treatment, eight of these patients developed thyroid dysfunction. Patients with COPD were at increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis compared to non-COPD patients (OR 3.9 95% CI 1.135-13.260, p = 0.0227). Our study showed that patients dealing with COPD have a 3.9 times greater risk of developing autoimmune thyroiditis as an adverse event during Pembrolizumab treatment compared with patients without COPD.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were promising medical treatments for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while the financial toxicity could not be neglected due to the high cost which might impair the prognosis and quality of life. Thus, we compared the cost-effectiveness analyses to identify the potential financial toxicity of metastatic NSCLC received ICIs. A systematic literature search was performed for the published economic evaluation of ICIs in the Medline and Web of Science databases between January 2015 and September 2021. Only the studies conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis, including total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), were included in our research. We compared the economic outcomes between the immunotherapy group and chemotherapy group and stratified by the programmed death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist would be employed to check the quality of included papers. A total of 25 studies and 30 cost-effectiveness analyses were included, in which 22 (73.3%) were on Pembrolizumab, eight (26.7%) on Atezolizumab, and 17 (56.7%) on the American payer perspective. In total, the ICER was lower than the willingness to pay (WTP) in 43% of the included analyses. The ICER of Pembrolizumab was lower than that of Atezolizumab (P = 0.049), and it was comparable between ICER and WTP either for Pembrolizumab (P = 0.533) or Atezolizumab (P = 0.056). The economic outcomes were all comparable as stratified by the PD-L1 expression. Immunotherapy could bring financial toxicity, and financial toxicity assessment during clinical decision would weaken the potential impact in the whole course of immunotherapy.",

In Japan, beta-thalassemia occurs in only 1 in 1000 individuals, and reports of thalassemia in patients with breast cancer are extremely rare. We report a case of triple-negative breast cancer in which thalassemia manifested as progressive anemia during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A Filipino woman in her 40\u00a0s with a family history of breast cancer presented with a left breast mass. Physical examination revealed a 2-cm palpable mass in the outer lower quadrant of the left breast. Ultrasonography confirmed a 21-mm irregular hypoechoic mass in the corresponding area with immunohistochemistry indicating a triple-negative phenotype (ER-, PgR-, HER2-negative, Ki-67 index 60%). Pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin were administered every 3\u00a0weeks, during which the hemoglobin (Hb) level gradually decreased. Thalassemia was diagnosed based on low pretreatment mean corpuscular volume (67.6 fL), presence of target cells in peripheral blood, and elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Despite the anemia progression, the patient was able to complete the planned chemotherapy regimen with blood transfusion support. This included 4 cycles of pembrolizumab, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Subsequently, a partial mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, and the patient achieved a pathological complete response. This case demonstrates that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can be successfully completed with appropriate blood transfusion support in patients with thalassemia-induced anemia.",

Thyroid dysfunction occurred in 24 patients (48%), with 12 (24%) developing hypothyroidism, 4 (8%) developing hyperthyroidism, and 8 (16%) experiencing a transition from hyperthyroidism to hypothyroidism. The incidence of thyroid dysfunction was significantly higher in patients treated with atezolizumab compared to pembrolizumab (P = 0.04), with 87.5% of affected patients receiving atezolizumab. The median time to onset of thyroid dysfunction was 10 cycles (interquartile range [IQR]: 5) for hypothyroidism and six cycles (IQR: 19) for hyperthyroidism. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in patients who developed thyroid dysfunction, with the median PFS not reached, compared to a median PFS of 14 months (95% CI: 9.68-18.32) in patients without thyroid dysfunction (P = 0.038). No significant associations were found between thyroid dysfunction and patient age or gender. These findings suggest that thyroid dysfunction is a common irAE in patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving ICIs, particularly atezolizumab, and its development may be associated with improved PFS. Regular monitoring of thyroid function is recommended to promptly identify and manage thyroid abnormalities during ICI therapy, potentially improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The immune checkpoint targeting is nowadays an integral part of cancer therapies. However, only a minority of patients experience long-term benefits. Thus, the identification of predictive biomarkers contributing to therapy response is urgently needed. Here, we analyzed different immune and tumor specific expression and secretion profiles in the peripheral blood and tumor samples of 50 breast cancer patients by multicolor flow cytometry and bead-based immunoassays at the time of diagnosis. Due to individual phenotype variations, we quantitatively scored 25 expressed and secreted immune-associated (e.g., LAG-3, PD-1, TIM-3, CD27) and tumor relevant markers (e.g., PD-L1, CD44, MHC-I, MHC-II) in immune checkpoint-treated triple negative breast cancer patients based on the current literature. The calculated score divided the patients into individuals with predicted pCR (total score of >\u20090) or predicted residual disease (total score of \u2264\u20090). At the end of the neoadjuvant therapy, the truly achieved pathological complete response (pCR; end of observation) was determined. The calculated score was 79% in accordance with the achieved pCR at the time of surgery. Moreover, the sensitivity was 83.3%, the specificity 76.9%, the positive predictive value 62.5%, and the negative predictive value 90.9%. In addition, we identified a correlation of PD-1 and LAG-3 expression between tumor-associated and peripheral immune cells, which was independent of the subtype. Overall, PD-1 was the most frequently expressed checkpoint. However, in a number of patient-derived tumors, additional checkpoints as LAG-3 and TIM-3 were substantially (co-)expressed, which potentially compromises anti-PD-(L)1 mono-therapy. This study represents a proof-of-principle to identify potential checkpoint therapy responders in advance at the time of diagnosis. The work was based on a scoring derived from a multiplexed marker profiling. However, larger patient cohorts need to be prospectively evaluated for further validation.",

This Phase 1b study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapies (Parts A-D), exemestane + everolimus (Part E), or fulvestrant + LY3023414 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor; Part G) in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC), or trastuzumab (Part F), or trastuzumab + pertuzumab (Part H) in patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) MBC. This study enrolled women aged \u226518 years old with either HR+, HER2- (Parts E and G), or HER2+ (Parts F and H) MBC. Additional requirements included measurable disease or non-measurable but evaluable bone disease (Parts E and F), or measurable disease (Parts G and H), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and no prior treatment with CDK4/6i (Parts E, F, and H). Adverse events were graded, and tumor response was assessed. Nineteen patients in Part E received abemaciclib (150 mg, n=15; 200 mg, n=4) with exemestane + everolimus, 24 patients in Part F received abemaciclib (150 mg, n=18; 200 mg, n=6) with trastuzumab, 12 patients in Part G received 150 mg abemaciclib with fulvestrant + LY3023414 (100 mg, n=7; 150 mg, n=5), and four patients in Part H received abemaciclib (100 mg) with trastuzumab + pertuzumab (with prophylactic loperamide). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, and nausea. Grade \u22653 TEAEs were reported in 16, 18, 10, and 4 patients in Parts E-H, respectively. Abemaciclib had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combination study drugs. The objective response rates for patients with measurable disease were 46.2%, 10.0%, 66.7%, and 25.0% in Parts E-H, respectively. A recommended Phase 2 dose was not established for Parts E, G, and H at the dose levels evaluated, and was determined to be 150 mg Q12H in Part F. Overall, our results demonstrate safety profiles consistent with those previously established for abemaciclib and provide preliminary data for these combination therapies in the treatment of HR+, HER2- or HER2+ MBC.",

    "abstract": "A nomogram to predict shrinkage modes after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) was constructed in HER-2 positive (HER2\u00a0+) breast cancer. The value and mechanism of targeting long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as efficacy prediction biomarker was also evaluated. All enrolled patients received six cycles of chemotherapy (docetaxel\u00a0+\u00a0carboplatin) and anti-HER-2 dual-targeted therapy (Trastuzumab\u00a0+\u00a0Pertuzumab) before surgery. According to pathological 3D models of residual tumor from 71 HER2\u00a0+\u00a0patients, shrinkage modes were divided into concentric shrinkage mode (CSM) and non-CSM (NCSM). LncRNAs in core biopsy tissues in the CSM and NCSM groups were selected by microarray and validated by RT-PCR. A nomogram was constructed to predict shrinkage modes after NAT in combination with clinical-pathological and transcriptome signatures. Cell proliferation was used CCK-8 and colony formation assay. PAPIS Kit was used to perform nuclear and cytoplasmic separation. The cell drug resistance assays were to explore the value of paclitaxel. The ChIRP-MS assay was to search RNA-binding proteins and verified by WB. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Independent predictors of NCSM were lymph nodes downstaging after NAT, mammographic malignant calcification, hormone receptor expression, and RUVBL1-AS1 expression. A nomogram was constructed in combination with these predictors, which showed an area under the curve of 0.883, supporting the predictive power of the method. Overexpression of RUVBL1-AS1 inhibited HER2\u00a0+\u00a0cells proliferation. Overexpression of RUVBL1-AS1 increased the number of cells in G1/S phase and decreased that of cells in G2 phase. RUVBL1-AS1 increased paclitaxel resistance and downregulate VCP expression. RUVBL1-AS1 affects cell cycle progression by downregulating VCP, resulting in the reduction of cells in G2/M phase, thereby weakening the sensitivity to paclitaxel. The nomogram could accurately predict shrinkage modes after NAT, and may help guide the individualized selection of breast conserving surgery candidates after NAT. RUVBL1-AS1 might be a promising therapeutic target of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy inHER2\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The development of targeted therapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors has ushered in the era of precision medicine in treating lung cancer, which remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Both targeted therapy and immunotherapy have significantly improved the survival of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, recent groundbreaking studies have demonstrated their efficacy in both the perioperative setting and following concurrent chemoradiotherapy in early-stage NSCLC. Despite significant advancements in first-line treatment options, disease progression remains inevitable for most patients with advanced NSCLC, necessitating the exploration and optimization of subsequent therapeutic strategies. Emerging novel agents are expanding treatment options in the first-line setting and beyond. Recently, emerging bispecific antibodies have shown enhanced efficacy. For instance, amivantamab has been approved as a treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC, including those with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Additionally, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including HER2-targeting trastuzumab deruxtecan, TROP2-targeting ADCs, HER3-targeting patritumab deruxtecan, and MET-targeting telisotuzumab vedotin, have demonstrated promising outcomes in several clinical trials. This review summarizes the recent advancements and challenges associated with the evolving NSCLC therapeutic landscape.",

    "abstract": "The binary classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as HER2-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+/in situ hybridization (ISH)+ or 3+] or HER2-negative (IHC 0, 1+, or 2+/ISH-) has been reassessed due to the efficacy of an anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2-low (IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH-) unresectable/metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients. However, little is known about the prevalence and outcomes of HER2-low mBC in Taiwan. This retrospective study rescored archived HER2 IHC slides of HER2-negative unresectable/mBC patients diagnosed from 2017 to 2020. The HER2-low prevalence (among HER2-negative), clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of HER2-low unresectable/mBC patients were investigated. Of the rescored HER2-negative cohort, HER2-low prevalence was 61.2 % (186/304) and slightly higher in slides tested by non-Ventana 4B5 assays (vs. Ventana 4B5) and slides from metastatic sites (vs. primary tumors). The overall percentage agreement between historical and rescored IHC was high (90.1 %). For HR+/HER2-low patients, endocrine therapies were frequently used in the first two lines of treatment, while chemotherapy was more common after the second-line treatment. Chemotherapy was the predominant treatment for HR-/HER2-low patients. Time to next treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) since the first-line systemic therapy were longer in the HR+/HER2-low (N = 138) compared to HR-/HER2-low (N = 48) cohorts (median TTNT: 7.6 vs. 4.8 months; median OS: 37.7 vs. 18.8 months). This study suggested that two-thirds of HER2-negative unresectable/mBC patients in Taiwan were HER2-low. Reassessing the HER2 status of HER2-negative patients could improve treatment strategies with the evolving HER2 classification paradigm.",

    "abstract": "The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and new derivative formulations are the standard treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. However, after 1 to 5 years of treatment, some patients acquire resistance to therapy, leading to relapse. The microRNA-449 family members were downregulated in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines and low levels were associated with patients' worse prognosis. Moreover, trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines showed lower microRNAs-449 and higher Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) expression, compared to sensitive cell lines. The direct regulation of FASN by microRNA-449a and microRNA-449b-5p was demonstrated. Moreover, microRNAs-449 overexpression and FASN inhibition decreased cell proliferation and sensitized cells to trastuzumab treatment by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Together, these results suggest the microRNAs-449/FASN axis as a potential therapeutic target in combination with anti-HER2 agents to overcome trastuzumab resistance and to improve treatment response in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

Tumor tissues from 146 breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel-FEC)\u2009\u00b1\u2009trastuzumab at Osaka University Hospital (OUH) were used to classify patients into Gp-R or Gp-NR using IRSN-23. The ability to predict a pathological complete response (pCR) was assessed and the results were validated with independent public datasets (N\u2009=\u20091282). In the OUH dataset, the pCR rate was significantly higher in the Gp-R group than in the Gp-NR group without trastuzumab (29 versus 1%, P\u2009=\u20091.70E-5). In all validation sets without anti-HER2 therapy, the pCR rate in the Gp-R group was significantly higher than that in the Gp-NR group. The pooled analysis of the validation set showed higher pCR rates in the Gp-R group than in the Gp-NR group, both without (N\u2009=\u20091103, 40 versus 12%, P\u2009=\u20092.02E-26) and with (N\u2009=\u2009304, 49 versus 35%, P\u2009=\u20090.017) anti-HER2 therapy. Collaboration analyses of IRSN-23 and Oncotype Dx or PAM50 could identify highly chemotherapy-sensitive groups and refine breast cancer subtype classification based on the tumor microenvironment (offensive factor-PAM50 and defensive factor-IRSN-23), and the immune subtype was correlated with a better prognosis after NAC. This study offers new validation analyses of IRSN-23 in predicting chemotherapy efficacy, showing high reproducibility. The findings indicate the clinical value of using IRSN-23 for refining breast cancer subtype classification, with implications for personalized treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "One year of adjuvant trastuzumab is the standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer. In low-middle income countries, delivery of 1-year trastuzumab is challenging due to significant financial burden. Evidence for shorter durations of adjuvant trastuzumab is gaining popularity in this regard. In this study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of 1 year versus shorter durations of adjuvant trastuzumab practiced in our center. In total, 312 patients were included in this analysis. The median age was 52 years. More than two-thirds of patients (67.6%) had stage 2 disease and majority were hormone-receptor-positive (62.5%). The median follow-up duration was 50 months. The 4-year disease-free survival was 97.3%. The 4-year disease-free survival for shorter durations of adjuvant trastuzumab was 98% compared with 96.7% in 1-year trastuzumab therapy group. In univariate analysis, stage at diagnosis was the only factor which had statistically significant association with disease-free survival. In multivariate analysis, none of the variables were found to be predictive of survival. Two patients (0.6%) had significant left ventricular ejection fraction decline. Shorter durations of adjuvant trastuzumab have comparable 4-year disease-free survival to standard 1-year therapy and is an alternative adjuvant treatment option for HER2-positive breast cancer patients in resource-limited settings.",

After median follow-up of 45.7 (95% CI: 43.0-49.1) months, respective median overall survival (OS) for octogenarians versus younger patients lasted 12.0 (95% CI: 7.7-16.2) versus 23.9 (95% CI: 19.5-27.4) months (P = .0002), and median PFS for 5.0 (95% CI: 2.8-9.2) versus 8.3 (95% CI: 7.2-9.8) months (P = .039). Their respective objective response rates did not differ significantly: 42% (95% CI: 24-60) vs. 49% (95% CI: 43-54). Based on the results of this large multicenter population, first-line pembrolizumab efficacy against NSCLCs expressing \u2265 50% PD-L1 in octogenarians seems inferior to that obtained in younger patients. The higher percentage of nonsmokers and fewer adenocarcinomas could partially explain that finding.",

    "title": "The impact of the immunological context on outcomes of solid cancer patients treated with genotype-matched targeted therapies: a\u00a0comprehensive review.",
    "abstract": "Outcomes with genotype-matched targeted therapy in solid cancer patients are heterogeneous: some have exceptional responses, whereas others have primary progression. This review explores the immunobiological features which may underlie this differential response. We conducted a literature review of studies assessing the impact of immune context following searches on Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Relevant outcomes include response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Data were extracted from multivariate analysis, univariate analysis or directly from Kaplan-Meier curves. Meta-analyses were carried out where three or more studies analysed the same immune factor for the same cancer type. The remaining studies were analysed descriptively. In the adjuvant setting, assessment of the immune context does not highlight a group failing to derive benefit for the use of dabrafenib/trametinib after resection of BRAFV600E melanoma. Differential gene expression in exceptional responders show enrichment of genes associated with immune activation. BRAFV600E colorectal cancer patients with high cytolytic scores benefit from the addition of MEK inhibition whereas those with low scores fare better without. High programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is predictive of inferior outcomes to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ALK and G12C tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant patients with high CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 positivity have very poor outcomes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes predict for efficacy of stromal-poor tumours in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer treated with short-course adjuvant trastuzumab. High immune metagene and single immune gene expression are predictive of benefit for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, but not chemotherapy alone. The addition of pertuzumab or lapatanib appears to be beneficial in those with immune non-enriched microenvironments. High major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I is negatively predictive and high MHC-II is positively predictive of outcomes with trastuzumab-based therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first review assessing immunological context as a biomarker for targeted therapy. The results of this review represent an important resource to aid future translational studies in advancing stratified precision medicine oncology.",

    "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancer, characterized by the overexpression of HER2 receptors, often develops resistance to trastuzumab, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we explore the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with a trastuzumab-IRDye700DX photoimmunoconjugate (Tz-IR700) as a strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance. Tz-IR700 combines the antibody's selectivity for the tumoral cells with the cytotoxic effect of IR700, induced by red light. Our results demonstrate that Tz-IR700 selectively accumulates in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive tumours (HCC1954) thereby enabling precise tumour localization by fluorescence imaging. Upon irradiation with red light, Tz-IR700 induces significant HCC1954\u00a0cell viability reduction both in vitro and in vivo, notably overcoming trastuzumab resistance in this HER2-positive breast cancer cell line. Mechanistic studies unequivocally demonstrate that the primary cytotoxic species is singlet oxygen. These findings suggest that Tz-IR700 could serve as a valuable treatment option for trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer and may also be used as an adjuvant to fluorescence-guided surgery, improving surgical outcomes and reducing the likelihood of tumour recurrence and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding phenotypic variations in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction during cancer therapy may allow for tailored surveillance and prevention. This study sought to determine LV dysfunction phenotypes during cancer therapy and their interrelated-ness and association with cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), myocardial tissue changes, and blood biomarkers. This is a secondary analysis of the EMBRACE-MRI (Evaluation of Myocardial Changes During BReast Adenocarcinoma Therapy to Detect Cardiotoxicity Earlier With MRI) study in which women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer were recruited prospectively. High-sensitivity troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and echocardiography were obtained pre-anthracycline and every 3\u00a0months with measurement of systolic and diastolic function and left atrial reservoir strain (LARS). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed at baseline and follow-ups with quantification of myocardial T1, T2, and extracellular volume (ECV). Diastolic dysfunction (DD) was graded using American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (\"conventional\") and regraded by replacing left atrial volume with LARS\u00a0<24% (\"modified\"). Relative reduction in global longitudinal strain (GLS) >15% was considered \"worsening GLS,\" and CTRCD was defined using CMR-derived left ventricular ejection fraction. Among 136 women (age 51.1 \u00b1 9.2 years), CTRCD developed in 37 of 136 (27%) and worsening GLS in 53 of 126 (42%) with analyzable studies. Incident DD occurred in 25 (19.4%) of 129 and 19 (14.4%) of 132 patients by conventional and modified grading, respectively. Using LARS improved the ability to classify DD. Transition state analysis demonstrated that the first abnormal state during cancer therapy could be worsening GLS, DD, CTRCD, or a combination. A greater proportion of patients who first transition to DD vs worsening GLS developed subsequent CTRCD (5 of 8 [63%]) vs 7 of 39 [18%]). Worsening DD was associated with higher odds of subsequent CTRCD (OR: 20.9, 95%\u00a0CI: 3.4-129.5) vs worsening GLS (OR: 4.9, 95%\u00a0CI: 2.6-9.4). DD was significantly associated with radiation dose and ECV but not with blood biomarkers. Patients receiving breast cancer therapy can develop significant GLS change, DD, or CMR-defined CTRCD that can occur in isolation, concurrently, or sequentially. Development of DD is associated with ECV and higher\u00a0risk for subsequent CTRCD.

    "abstract": "A regimen of weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab (WPH) is the standard treatment for patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer but has certain limitations. Weekly hospital visits are burdensome for patients and increase healthcare resource use. Docetaxel is currently used in several chemotherapy regimens for HER2-positive breast cancer, such as four cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide plus trastuzumab (TC4H) or THP (paclitaxel, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab), and its safety and efficacy have been well established. Therefore, for patients who cannot visit the hospital for treatment every week, we have implemented a 3-week docetaxel regimen to replace the weekly paclitaxel schedule for these early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Our retrospective analysis conducted from 2014 to 2019 assessed the efficacy and safety of a docetaxel-and-trastuzumab (TH) regimen in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, with the aim of establishing a more accessible and efficient treatment approach. This is a single-arm retrospective study analysis of TH therapy for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer conducted in The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University between January 2015 and December 2019. Patients included were lymph node-negative, aged 50 years or older, and had received TH regimen after surgery, with comprehensive follow-up data available. Patients received six cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m A total of 144 breast cancer patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 61.5 years and 80 patients (55.6%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. In the entire study population, 34.7% of patients had tumors 1 cm or smaller. The median follow-up time of the included patients was 7.1 years, the 5-year DFS rate was 96.5%, and the OS rate was 98.6%. Among the five patients who experienced invasive disease events or death, three had local or regional recurrences. Three patients (2.1%) experienced at least one episode of grade 3 neuropathy, and five patients had a significant decrease in ejection fraction, leading to a 3.5% interruption of trastuzumab treatment. None of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions to the study treatment. The TH regimen demonstrated promise as a novel treatment alternative for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. It offers a similar degree of efficacy and safety to those of the conventional WPH regimen while requiring fewer hospital visits, which could result in reduced healthcare costs and enhanced patient convenience.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive invasive breast cancer (BC) accounts for 15-20% of all cases, requiring HER2-targeted neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Despite the success of trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted treatments, many patients still experience inadequate responses, highlighting the need for more accurate and accessible biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes. Serum HER2 (sHER2) levels, as a non-invasive biomarker, have shown promise in monitoring treatment response; however, the role of sHER2 dynamics during treatment remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of sHER2 dynamics as a predictor of pathological complete response (pCR) in HER2-positive BC patients undergoing NAT. This retrospective study analyzed 120 HER2-positive BC patients who underwent standard NAT followed by surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC). sHER2 levels were measured at three time points: baseline, after the second cycle of therapy (C2), and at surgery. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between changes in sHER2 levels and the achievement of pCR. The study also examined the influence of other clinicopathological factors such as estrogen receptor (ER) status, Ki67, and tissue HER2 (tHER2) levels on pCR. During NAT, sHER2 levels showed a significant decline, with a more pronounced reduction observed in patients achieving pCR. The greatest reduction in sHER2 levels after C2 was strongly associated with pCR. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified significant reductions in sHER2 levels after C2 and ER-negative status as independent predictors of pCR. Notably, sHER2 changes from baseline to C2 demonstrated a stronger predictive value for pCR compared to changes observed later in treatment. Our study confirms that reductions in sHER2 levels after C2 are a strong indicator of favorable treatment response in HER2-positive BC patients undergoing NAT. Monitoring sHER2 dynamics early in treatment can serve as a useful, non-invasive biomarker to predict pCR and may guide therapeutic decisions in clinical practice.",

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to identify the optimal first-line regimen with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy for advanced squamous NSCLC. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were performed. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases and major annual conferences were searched. RCTs that compared PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (version 2.0), and a funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. A total of nine RCTs comprising 3,210 patients were included. When combined with chemotherapy, PD-1 inhibitors were superior to PD-L1 inhibitors in terms of overall survival (OS) [PD-1: hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.62 to 0.79; PD-L1: HR 0.82, 95% CrI: 0.71 to 0.94] and progression-free survival (PFS) (PD-1: HR 0.50, 95% CrI: 0.45 to 0.55; PD-L1: HR 0.63, 95% CrI: 0.55 to 0.72). Moreover, the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab was the most effective agent in combined therapy for prolonging OS (HR 0.56, 95% CrI: 0.44 to 0.71) and PFS (HR 0.32, 95% CrI: 0.25 to 0.42), followed by the PD-L1 inhibitor sugemalimab (OS: HR 0.61, 95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.86; PFS: HR 0.37, 95% CrI: 0.26 to 0.52). Moreover, the addition of camrelizumab or tislelizumab to chemotherapy was associated with the improved objective response rate (ORR) and a longer duration of response (DoR). Regarding safety, pembrolizumab and camrelizumab were associated with the lowest risk of developing grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Most of the trials were at low risk for bias, and no obvious publication bias was observed in the outcomes. When combined with first-line chemotherapy, camrelizumab has the potential to be a preferred option in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. This finding might serve as a guideline to aid in the selection of first-line immunotherapy plus chemotherapy strategies for advanced squamous NSCLC.",

This study, for the first time, aimed to directly compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus tislelizumab plus chemotherapy in resectable NSCLC using real-world data. Data of patients with resectable NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or tislelizumab plus chemotherapy followed by radical resection between December 2017 and August 2023 at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were retrospectively analyzed. Patients aged 18 years and above, diagnosed with biopsy-proven and treatment-na\u00efve clinical stage II-IIIb NSCLC were included in the study. Patients with autoimmune disease, pulmonary interstitial disease, acute infection, or systemic immunosuppression were excluded. Data that may affect treatment efficacy were collected, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, comorbidities, pulmonary function, pathological type, clinical stage, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS), dosage of neoadjuvant therapy, duration from final therapy to surgery and chemotherapy regimens, and compared between the two groups. The follow-up was performed through outpatient visits or telephone calls. The last follow-up was set in June 2024. A total of 126 patients were included and divided into the pembrolizumab (n=62) and tislelizumab (n=64) groups with a median follow-up time of 26.3 months.

This work examines the impact of different ABO blood groups (BG) on the response to CIT monotherapy. Retrospective analysis of patients with stage IV NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportional score/TPS \u2265\u200950%), receiving first-line therapy with pembrolizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy at the West German Cancer Center from 2017 to 2022. Study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Eighty-two patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-two patients (27%) received first-line therapy with pembrolizumab alone (monoimmunotherapy cohort/MIC), of which seven patients (32%) had BGO. Sixty patients (73%) were treated with pembrolizumab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy (chemoimmunotherapy cohort/CIC), of which 38 (63%) had BGO. In MIC, younger age and BGO were independent predictors of favorable OS (BGO vs. other ABO-BG: HR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9; p\u2009=\u20090.037; median OS 62 versus 19\u2009months) and PFS (BGO vs. other ABO-BG: HR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8; p\u2009=\u20090.024; median PFS 39 vs. 4\u2009months). There was no significant impact of ABO-BG in patients treated with CIC. In support, a historical control group treated with chemotherapy alone also showed no prognostic impact of the ABO-BG. BGO associates with favorable survival in patients with NSCLC receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, but not in patients with chemo-immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Further validation of this promising strategy for personalized decision-making is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The effects of long-term nicotine exposure on the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer have only been studied epidemiologically, leaving the molecular mechanisms unclear. Therefore, it's challenging for clinicians to devise effective treatments based on this correlation. Our investigation explores the effects of prolonged nicotine exposure on the interaction between \u03b19-nAChR and HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, highlighting its impact on anti-HER2 drug therapy efficacy. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis to compare HER2\u202f+\u202ftumor samples from smokers and non-smokers, finding a more vital interaction between \u03b19-nAChR and HER2 in non-smoker's breast tumor tissues. A simulated study on the breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor mouse model (n\u202f=\u202f6 per group) revealed that long-term nicotine exposure significantly reduced this interaction compared to controls. Due to the poorer response of low HER2 tumors to trastuzumab in clinical practice, most patients require combination chemotherapy and have a worse prognosis. Therefore, this study chose HER2-low PDX models to simulate nicotine exposure and explore treatment strategies. Mice subjected to prolonged nicotine exposure exhibited faster tumor growth and reduced trastuzumab efficacy compared to controls (*p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Our results demonstrate that extended nicotine exposure weakens \u03b19-nAChR and HER2 interaction, reducing the effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy, fostering drug resistance, and underscoring the carcinogenic risks of nicotine.",

However, to date, no definitive prognostic markers have been found to predict trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Patients diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer, scheduled to receive anthracyclines followed by 12\u00a0months of trastuzumab or with pertuzumab, were prospectively followed up for 27\u00a0months. Measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF, high-sesitivity troponin I hs-Tn I, and a full cardiac examination were performed at baseline, after anthracycline treatment, and after four cycles of anti-HER2 agents. Subsequently, LVEF measurement and full cardiac examination were conducted every 3\u00a0months until the end of the follow-up. Cardiotoxicity was defined as an absolute decrease in LVEF of\u00a0\u226515%, or a drop in LVEF of\u00a0\u226510% from the baseline to\u00a0<50%. Among 78 patients, cardiotoxicity occurred in 13 (16.7%). A higher risk of cardiotoxicity was linked to hs-Tn I measured after four cycles of anti-HER2 agents ( Hs-Tn I measured after four cycles of trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients could be an important predictor of cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy followed by anti-HER2 agents, particularly in the first year post-treatment, with a different cutoff value than that used in other cardiac conditions.",

    "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancer occurs in about 15-20 % of all breast cancers. It is both a prognostic and predictive biomarker and the introduction of anti-HER2 therapy over the last 20 years has significantly improved outcomes in this subset of patients, so that they are now comparable to or better than those of patients with HER2-negative tumors. Approximately 5-10% of patients are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. It was good news for these patients when, on April 17, 2020, the FDA approved tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The efficacy of the regimen was demonstrated in the HER2CLIMB trial, which enrolled 612 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and/or trastuzumab emtansine. Median overall survival for patients in the tucatinib arm was 21.9 months (95% CI 18.3-31.0) compared with 17.4 months (95% CI 13.6-19.9) for patients in the control arm (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.50-0.87; P = 0.00480). Our patient is a middle-aged woman without visceral metastatic involvement, but with extensive nodal involvement, skeletal metastatic involvement and left breast almost completely consumed by tumor. This woman had a more or less successful three lines of anti-HER2 therapy and the fourth line of one-year-long systemic treatment with the cytostatic eribulin. The inclusion of tucatinib with trastuzumab and capecitabine in the fifth line of systemic therapy achieved a very nice partial regression of the primary tumor without significant toxicity.

    "abstract": "Retrospective studies have shown that the continuation use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients who progressed during treatment with trastuzumab still may have clinical benefits. However, the optimal strategy was still unknown. We conducted this study aiming to explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib plus chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab in HER2 positive MBC patients who progressed after previous trastuzumab treatment. This was a real-world retrospective study that enrolled HER2 positive MBC patients previously treated with trastuzumab. Patients were divided into control group (pyrotinib combined with chemotherapy) and combined group (trastuzumab combined with pyrotinib and chemotherapy). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were objective remission rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety. A total of 101 patients were included in the analysis with median follow-up time of 25.5 months (95%CI, 22.5-33.0). The median PFS was 19.1 months (95%CI 10.5-NA, P\u00a0=\u00a00.039) in combined group and 11.5 months (95%CI 8.1-15.1) in control group. The ORR was 55.6% in the combined group compared with 43.0% in the control group(P\u00a0=\u00a00.299), and the DCR was 100% compared with 87.7% respectively(P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhea [7(25.0%)], neutropenia [5(14.3%)] and leukopenia [4(11.4%)] in combined group and diarrhea [3(5.0%)], neutropenia [3(5.0%)] and leukopenia [3(5.0%)] in control group.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, particularly with PD-1 inhibitors like nivolumab, has become a critical treatment option for advanced NSCLC. ICI therapy has revolutionized treatment, but prior chemotherapy may diminish ICI treatment efficacy. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has emerged as a crucial predictor of ICI response, yet its interaction with chemotherapy history in ICI therapy is not fully understood. In this study, I investigate the impact of chemotherapy history on ICI treatment outcomes, focusing on TMB as a potential mitigating factor. Analyzing data from 512 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitors, this sudy found that prior chemotherapy significantly reduced objective response rates (ORR) to ICI therapy, particularly in patients with low TMB (<15 mut/Mb). However, in patients with high TMB (\u226515 mut/Mb), the negative impact of chemotherapy history on ICI treatment efficacy is minimal, suggesting that high TMB mitigates chemotherapy-induced resistance to ICI therapy. Furthermore, while chemotherapy history is associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) following ICI therapy in low-TMB patients, no such association is observed in high-TMB patients. These findings highlight the importance of TMB as a predictive biomarker, emphasizing the need for optimal treatment sequencing and personalized therapeutic strategies to overcome chemotherapy-induced immune resistance and maximize ICI treatment efficacy. These results suggest that ICI therapy may be more beneficial as a first-line treatment, particularly for patients with low TMB.",

In breast cancer prevention, it is important to consider that the risk of developing the disease is not the same for the entire population. This pathology presents heterogeneous clinical manifestations and the most common classification is related to the following hormonal receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and triple-negative (TNBC). Currently, a new class of therapy is being used for cancer treatment: anti-body-drug conjugates. A bibliographic search was performed by establishing keywords and then combining them using Boolean operators OR and AND. Thus, the search equation was formulated according to the PICO search question to be used in the PubMed database. Results: Fifteen studies that met the established inclusion criteria were analyzed, and their methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach, demonstrating high reliability in the results obtained, the analyzed studies focus on the combination of adjuvant Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab with chemotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

HER2 status exhibited variability between matched Bxs, with observed discordance rates of 26%, 44%, and 33% between matched core-surgical, early-metastatic, and two metastatic matched Bxs, respectively. Our findings indicate that HER2 status can vary between different Bxs taken during the disease course of patients with TNBC with the highest discordance rate observed between the primary and metastatic Bxs. For patients with metastastic HER2-0 TNBC, repeat Bxs can increase the chance of obtaining a HER2-low result, thereby offering patients a promising therapeutic option.",

Data were collected from 290 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between August 2019 and August 2023. Blood samples were collected to assess the serum enzyme levels, including ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and GGT. Univariable analysis was first performed, followed by multivariable logistic regression, to assess the association of pCR with ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and GGT levels before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with H and P. Of the 290 patients, 174 (60%) achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with dual-target therapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that lower ALT and GGT levels, higher ALT levels before treatment (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-3.67; p = 0.02), and higher GGT levels after treatment (OR, 2.04; 95% CI 1.14-3.66; p = 0.017) were significantly associated with pCR. Additionally, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with H and P dual-target therapy increased ALT, AST, LDH, and GGT levels in patients' blood. Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with H and P dual-target therapy, ALT levels were associated with pCR. After the treatment, GGT levels were linked to pCR.

This study presents real-world data on the use of trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab, in combination with anthracycline and taxanes-based chemotherapy regimen. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with HER2-positive EBC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), treated between January 2014 and September 2021. The regimen included four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), followed by four cycles of docetaxel every three weeks, with anti-HER2 therapy administered alongside docetaxel. Outcomes assessed included pCR, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), and surgical outcomes.

Although dual therapy resulted in a higher pCR rate (46.6%) compared to trastuzumab alone (39.8%), the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.15). The estimated 3-year DFS was 86.1% with dual therapy and 83.1% with trastuzumab alone (p=0.37). Further stratification revealed superior 3-year DFS in node-negative disease (96.4%) compared to node-positive disease (82.3%), p=0.0021. Patients who achieved pCR had a significantly better 3-year DFS (89.3%) compared to those with residual disease (82.2%), p=0.0177. Rate of breast conserving surgery (BCS) was lower (15.2%) among patients who received trastuzumab alone, compared to 26.5% among those who received dual anti-HER2 [Odds Ratio (OR)= 0.50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.30-0.80,\u00a0p=0.005]. Dual anti-HER2 therapy did not significantly enhance DFS but was associated with higher BCS rates, highlighting its potential to improve surgical outcomes.",

    "title": "Assessment of the Efficacy and Pulmonary Toxicity of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2-Positive and HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer in a Tertiary Center in the United Arab Emirates.",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in patients who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. T-DXd is also indicated for unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, following prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or recurrent disease within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in treating HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients in a real-world clinical setting. In the T-DXd pivotal research, imaging assessments were conducted every six weeks with CT or MRI, but outside of a clinical trial setting, this frequent imaging is practically challenging due to resources and difficulty in reimbursing. In addition to clinical outcome assessments, we sought to review the incidence of pneumonitis in a real-world setting and to assess if the three-monthly response assessment scans would be sufficient to rule out asymptomatic pneumonitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients diagnosed with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or in situ hybridization (ISH) positive) or HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and ISH negative) MBC treated with T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg every 21 days, with standardized dose adjustments as required. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median follow-up duration was 15 months. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, and toxicity was determined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Data analysis was performed using SPSS IBM software version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, NY, US). The median age of the patients was 47 years, ranging from 29 to 86 years, with the majority being younger than 65 and predominantly women. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 at baseline. Most patients were HER2-positive, while a smaller proportion were classified as HER2-low. A significant number of patients presented with visceral disease, while a smaller subset had brain metastases at the time of baseline evaluation. Nearly half of the patients were hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and more than half had a high Ki-67 index of over 20%. The majority of patients received T-DXd as a second- or third-line treatment. Clinical responses included partial response, complete response, and stable disease. Survival outcomes showed high overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 24 months. Only one patient experienced grade 3 pneumonitis, suggesting that 12-weekly imaging assessments may be adequate for monitoring most patients. Our real-world experience confirms that the efficacy of T-DXd in UAE is consistent with published data from published phase 3 clinical trials. The incidence of clinical pulmonary toxicity is much lower than anticipated, and until further data is available, it may be reasonable to continue using the 12-weekly assessment scans to monitor patients for interstitial lung disease (ILD). Further studies are needed to determine the optimal imaging frequency\u00a0for monitoring ILD.",

    "abstract": "To explore the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in a real-world setting in a population with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, subgroup analysis was conducted based on different clinicopathological features to further explore the general characteristics of patients, tumor nature, and the effect of various lines of treatment before patients started pyrotinib on the efficacy of pyrotinib in the real-world study. The clinical pathological characteristics, drug efficacy and related adverse reactions of HER2-positive MBC patients treated with pyrotinib in six hospitals in Southeast Zhejiang Province from February 2018 to December 2023 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. A total of 342 patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled. The median follow-up time of 42.0 months. The median age of the overall population was 52 years (range from 25-90 year old). Median progression-free survival in the total population was 10.0 months, the median overall survival was 29.0 months. The (objective response rate, ORR) was 40.35% and the (disease control rate, DCR) was 83.92%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) in the total population was 10.0 months, the median overall survival was 29.0 months. And pyrotinib had better mPFS for advanced first-line treatment than for second-third-line and beyond(14.0 months vs.10.0 months vs.6.0 months, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that ECOG, HER2 status, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, number of pyrotinib treatment lines, previous lapatinib treatment, combined capecitabine therapy and trastuzumab resistance were independent prognostic factors for PFS. Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction (ADR) in 205 patients (59.94%), which could be controlled by antidiarrheal drugs. This multicenter study suggested that the use of pyrotinib for HER2 positive MBC had a relatively good efficacy, especially for those who received first-line pyrotinib treatment and those who were sensitive to previous trastuzumab treatment. Patients with brain metastasis and liver metastases also benefit from pyrotinib treatment, especially for patients treated with brain radiotherapy and/or surgery. ECOG, HER2 status, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, number of pyrotinib treatment lines, previous lapatinib treatment, combined capecitabine therapy and trastuzumab resistance were independent prognostic factors for PFS in HER2 Positive MBC patients treated with pyrotinib. The most common adverse reaction associated with pyrotinib is diarrhea, which can be well controlled through antidiarrheal treatment. Pyrotinib combined with vinorelbine has similar efficacy to pyrotinib combined with capecitabine and has fewer side effects, and can be used as an alternative to capecitabine.",

    "abstract": "Ivonescimab is a bispecific antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, yielding promising clinical outcomes for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in early-phase studies. We compared the efficacy and safety of ivonescimab with pembrolizumab in patients with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. HARMONi-2 is a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial across 55 hospitals in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer without sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocations and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 20 mg/kg ivonescimab or 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by histology, clinical stage, and PD-L1 expression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a masked independent radiographic review committee per RECIST v1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05499390; recruitment is complete, with the trial ongoing and final analysis to be reported later. Between Nov 9, 2022, and Aug 26, 2023, 398 (45%) of 879 screened patients were randomly assigned to receive ivonescimab (n=198) or pembrolizumab (n=200). At the preplanned interim analysis, median PFS was significantly longer with ivonescimab than with pembrolizumab (11\u00b71 vs 5\u00b78 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b751 [95% CI 0\u00b738-0\u00b769]; one-sided p<0\u00b70001). The PFS benefit of ivonescimab over pembrolizumab was broadly consistent within prespecified subgroups, including patients with PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) 1-49% (HR 0\u00b754 [95% CI 0\u00b737-0\u00b778]) and PD-L1 TPS of 50% of higher (HR 0\u00b748 [0\u00b729-0\u00b779]). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58 (29%) patients with ivonescimab and 31 (16%) patients with pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 14 (7%) of 197 patients on ivonescimab and 16 (8%) of 199 patients on pembrolizumab. Ivonescimab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were comparable between the two groups. Ivonescimab significantly improved PFS compared with pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with advanced PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, ivonescimab might represent another treatment option in the first-line setting for PD-L1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Akeso Biopharma.",

    "abstract": "Activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway is associated with reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and poor outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with a MEK inhibitor is synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We conducted a phase I/II trial of pembrolizumab and binimetinib in patients with metastatic TNBC with \u2264 3 prior lines of therapy. There were two dose levels (DL) with binimetinib at 45 mg at DL 0 and 30 mg at DL -1. The recommended phase II dose was the standard dose of pembrolizumab with binimetinib 30 mg twice daily. The objective response rate (ORR) was 30.4%, with a numerically higher ORR in patients without liver metastasis at 45.5%. Among patients who achieved objective responses, 80% had a duration of response > 12 months and ongoing even after stopping treatment (5.4 - 69.0 months). Patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (CPS \u2265 10) were more likely to respond with an ORR of 66.7%. However, clinical benefit was observed in 25% of patients with PD-L1-negative tumors. Consistent with preclinical studies, 4 out of 6 patients with clinical benefit had either increased PD-L1 or decreased p-ERK expressions in serial circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) after starting binimetinib. Pembrolizumab and binimetinib at 30 mg are safe with manageable toxicities. Promising activity was observed in patients without liver metastases. Future larger clinical trials are warranted to further evaluate the efficacy of this chemotherapy-free combination.",

This analysis included adults with tumor, node, metastasis stage IIIB-IV NSCLC (as defined in the 7th or 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control) treated with nivolumab monotherapy in 2L+ using data from the retrospective Epidemiological-Strategy and Medical Economics Lung Cancer database. The inclusion period was from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2020, with a follow-up until September 30, 2021. Analyses were stratified according to the duration of index nivolumab treatment and tumor programmed death ligand 1 expression levels. In total, the study included 4,001 patients (68% male; mean age [standard deviation] at index date, 63.6 [9.7] years) with a median follow-up of 34.3 months. The median nivolumab duration was 2.5 months (interquartile range, 1.4-6.3). The median overall survival (OS) from nivolumab initiation was 10.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6-10.8). The median real-world progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation or death (95% CI) were 2.2 (2.1-2.3) and 2.7 (2.5-2.8) months, respectively. In total, 2,985 (74.6%) patients discontinued index nivolumab treatment: 226 (7.6% of discontinuers) received a further immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI; 12.3% of discontinuers receiving further systemic treatment), and 1,604 (53.7%) received chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. The proportion of ICI-retreated patients was the highest among those with the longest index treatment duration (15.8% among discontinuers receiving \u226526 weeks' index nivolumab). The median OS from retreatment was longer in the resumption (ICI restart without another therapy for \u22656 weeks) compared with the rechallenge (ICI restart following non-ICI therapy) patient subgroup.

However, visual immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring is labour-intensive and prone to high interobserver variability, and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in diagnostic medicine. We conducted a diagnostic meta-analysis to evaluate AI's performance in classifying HER2 IHC scores, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting T-DXd eligibility, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 [95% CI 0.96-0.98] and specificity of 0.82 [95% CI 0.73-0.88]. Meta-regression revealed better performance with deep learning and patch-based analysis, while performance declined in externally validated and those utilising commercially available algorithms.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer affects millions globally, necessitating precise biomarker testing for effective treatment. HER2 testing is crucial for guiding therapy, particularly with novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like trastuzumab deruxtecan, which shows promise for breast cancers with low HER2 expression. Current HER2 testing methods, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), have limitations. IHC, a semi-quantitative assay, is prone to interobserver variability. While ISH provides higher precision than IHC, it remains more resource-intensive in terms of cost and workflow. However, turnaround time is typically faster than that of other advanced molecular methods such as next-generation sequencing. We adapted the clustering-constrained-attention multiple-instance deep learning model to improve IHC testing and reduce dependence on reflex fluorescence ISH (FISH) tests. Using 5,731 HER2 IHC images, including 592 cases with FISH testing, we trained two models: one for predicting HER2 scores from IHC images and another for predicting FISH scores from equivocal cases. The HER2 IHC score prediction model achieved 91%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 overall accuracy and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01. The FISH score prediction model had an ROC AUC of 0.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07, with sensitivity at 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 and specificity at 0.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03. External validation on cases from 203 institutions showed similar performance. The HER2 IHC model maintained a 91%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 accuracy and an ROC AUC of 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, while the FISH model had an ROC AUC of 0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, with sensitivity at 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 and specificity at 0.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01. Our model advances HER2 scoring by reducing subjectivity and variability in current scoring methods. Despite lower accuracy and sensitivity in the FISH prediction model, it may be a beneficial option for settings where reflex FISH testing is unavailable or prohibitive. With high specificity, our model can serve as an effective screening tool, enhancing breast cancer diagnosis and treatment selection.",

Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 44.8% of patients with mono-SHR-A1811, 71.6% with SHR-A1811 plus pyrotinib, and 38.8% with PCbHP. One patient experienced grade 2 interstitial lung disease in SHR-A1811, 9.1% of patients experienced grade 3 diarrhoea in SHR-A1811 plus pyrotinib, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. This is the first study to report the efficacy and safety of third-generation HER2-directed ADC in the neoadjuvant setting for HER2-positive breast cancer. SHR-A1811 showed robust activity, with a tolerable safety profile.",

    "abstract": "The optimal scheduling of PD-1 inhibitors with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer is unknown. We aimed to investigate the activity of two differing schedules of neoadjuvant nivolumab initiation with 12 weeks of carboplatin and paclitaxel for this patient population. Neo-N is an investigator-initiated, non-comparative, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial conducted at 12 hospitals in Australia, one in New Zealand, and one in Italy. Participants had to be aged 18 years or older; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, clinical stage I (cT1cN0) or II (cT1cN1, cT2cN0-1, or cT3cN0), oestrogen receptor expression of less than 1%, and progesterone receptor expression of less than 10%; had to be HER2 negative; and have previously untreated operable breast cancer with adequate organ function. Participants were stratified according to age and randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using a computer-generated sequence with a minimisation algorithm to either nivolumab 240 mg then 2 weeks later nivolumab 360 mg and carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks with concurrent paclitaxel 80 mg/m Between July 6, 2020, and April 1, 2022, 124 participants were enrolled and 14 were ineligible. 110 participants were randomly assigned and 108 were included in the modified intention-to treat analysis (53 in the lead-in group and 55 in the concurrent group). Median follow-up was 12 months (IQR 7-18). All patients were female with a median age of 49 years (IQR 43-60). 18 (17%) patients had clinically node-positive disease; 37 (34%) had clinical stage I, 70 (65%) had stage II, and one (1%) had stage III disease. The pathological complete response rate was observed in 27 (51% [39-63]) of 53 patients in the nivolumab lead-in group and in 30 (55% [43-66]) of 55 in the concurrent group. Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 70 (65%; 32 [60%] of 53 in the lead-in group and 38 [69%] of 55 in the concurrent group) of 108 patients, with the most common being decreased neutrophil count (25 [47%] of 53 in the lead-in group vs 28 [53%] of 55 in the concurrent group), anaemia (six [11%] vs ten [19%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (three [6%] vs three [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 16 (30%) patients in the lead-in group and 26 (47%) in the concurrent group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in seven (13%) patients in the lead-in group and 20 (36%) in the concurrent group. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. While this study did not support the hypothesis that lead-in nivolumab before chemotherapy was associated with a pathological complete response advantage, high pathological complete response rates were reached supporting shorter duration, non-anthracycline regimens in patients with newly diagnosed triple-negative breast cancer. Future trials are warranted to compare this regimen with the current standards of care. Breast Cancer Trials and Bristol Myers Squibb.",

    "abstract": "Early metabolic change on PET/CT was predictive of response to neoadjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab (HP) in TBCRC026. We hypothesized that a composite biomarker incorporating PET/CT and HER2 tissue-based biomarkers could improve biomarker performance. 83 patients with estrogen receptor-negative/HER2-positive breast cancer received neoadjuvant HP alone [pathologic complete response (pCR) 22\u00a0%]. PET/CT was performed at baseline and 15 days post initiation of therapy (C1D15). Promising imaging biomarkers included \u226540\u00a0% SULmax decline between baseline and C1D15, and C1D15 SULmax \u22643. Baseline tissue-based biomarkers included HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype (72\u00a0%, 46/64; NanoString), tumor HER2 protein abundance (median log2 13.5, range log2 7.1-15.9; NanoString DSP), and HER2 3+ (83\u00a0%, 64/77; immunohistochemistry). Logistic regressions were fitted to predict pCR with HER2/PET-CT biomarkers. The C statistic assessed overall prediction power. The optimal composite score cut-off was determined by maximizing Youden's index. Factors most predictive for pCR in single predictor models included C1D15 SULmax (OR 0.43; p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, c\u00a0=\u00a00.77), % reduction in SULmax (OR 1.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, c\u00a0=\u00a00.72) and tumor HER2 protein abundance (OR 1.75; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, c\u00a0=\u00a00.76). The composite of C1D15 SULmax and % reduction in SULmax and their interaction term, had improved probability (c\u00a0=\u00a00.89 from c\u00a0=\u00a00.78), with high sensitivity (100\u00a0%) and negative predictive value (100\u00a0%). The addition of tumor HER2 protein did not further improve prediction power (c\u00a0=\u00a00.90). The HER2/PET-CT biomarker had high prediction power for pCR, however was not superior to the prediction power of PET/CT alone. Non-invasive PET/CT biomarkers may facilitate a response-guided approach to neoadjuvant therapy, allowing intensification and de-intensification of treatment, pending further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Although HER2 positivity is prevalent in microinvasive breast cancer (MIBC), data focused on HER2-positive MIBC are limited. We investigated the clinical course and long-term outcomes of HER2-positive MIBC and evaluated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy. The study included patients with curatively resected pT1mi pN0 HER2-positive breast cancer between January 2000 and January 2020. Treatments and survival outcomes, including invasive breast cancer-free survival (IBCFS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. The analysis included 799 female patients. The median age was 51 years (range, 23-79), and 51.6% (n=412) were premenopausal. Multifocality was confirmed in 17.3% (n=138), and estrogen receptor (ER) positivity in 29.8% (n = 238). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 17.5% (n=140), with doxifluridine in 96.4% of cases. One patient (0.1%) received trastuzumab. With a median follow-up of 119.0 months (95% CI, 114.0-127.0), the 8-year IBCFS, DRFS, and OS were 91.2% (95% CI, 89.1-93.3), 97.5% (95% CI, 96.4-98.7), and 98.8% (95% CI, 98.0-99.6), respectively. No significant differences were observed between patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy. The lack of differences in IBCFS by chemotherapy was consistent across subgroups, including pre-/postmenopausal patients, grade 1-2/3 tumors, and ER-negative disease. A clinically meaningful proportion of HER2-positive MIBC patients experience IBCFS events with long-term follow-up. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve survival, potentially due to the use of an outdated, ineffective regimen. The role of modern adjuvant regimens, particularly those incorporating HER2-targeted therapy, warrants further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Improved outcomes in HER2+ female breast cancer have resulted from chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapies. However, HER2+ER+ cancers exhibit lower response rates. The phase 2 NA-PHER2 trial (NCT02530424) investigated chemo-free preoperative HER2 blockade (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) and CDK4/6 inhibition (palbociclib) with or without endocrine therapy (fulvestrant) in HER2+ER+ breast cancer. Clinical endpoints (i.e. Ki67 dynamics and pathological complete response) were previously reported. Here we report on the biomarker analysis, secondary objective of the study. Through RNA sequencing and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) assessment in serial biopsies, we identified biomarkers predictive of pCR or Day14 Ki67 response and unveiled treatment-induced molecular changes. High immune infiltration and low ER signalling correlated with pCR, while TP53 mutations associated with high Day14 Ki67. Stratification based on Ki67 at Day14 and at surgery defined three response groups (Ki67 HighHigh, LowHigh, LowLow), with divergent tumour and stroma expression dynamics. The HighHigh group showed dysfunctional immune infiltration and overexpression of therapeutic targets like PAK4 at baseline. The LowLow group exhibited a Luminal A phenotype by the end of treatment. This study expands our understanding of drivers and dynamics of HER2+ER+ tumour response, towards treatment tailoring.",

Eligible participants were aged \u226520 years with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC (any tumor PD-L1 status permitted). Participants received \u226435 doses of pembrolizumab 200\u00a0mg every 3 weeks intravenously (days 1 and 22 of 6-week cycles) plus \u226418 doses of ipilimumab 1\u00a0mg/kg every 6 weeks intravenously. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring during the DLT evaluation period (first 6 weeks of study treatment). The secondary endpoint was pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics; exploratory endpoints included evaluation of antitumor activity. Results were summarized descriptively. All 6 participants enrolled in Part D received \u22651 dose of pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab. No DLTs were observed.

Little is known about NSCLC harboring ERBB2 mutations in Latin America. This study aimed to characterize the real-world clinical characteristics and outcomes of ERBB2-mutant NSCLC in Latin America. Patients with NSCLC harboring ERBB2 mutations detected by next-generation sequencing in tumors or cfDNA were identified in databanks from 3 Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico). Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Of 1245 patients with NSCLC included from January 2015 to September 2022, 35 (2.8%) patients had tumors with ERBB2 mutations. The median age was 60 years (IQR: 49-69), 54.2% of patients were females, 59.4% were never smokers, 51.3% had baseline performance status ECOG 0, 91.5% were diagnosed with stage IV disease, and 29.7% had de novo brain metastasis. The most common ERBB2 mutations were A775_G776insYVMA (40%) and G780_P781dupGSP (20%). The most often co-mutated gene was TP53 (17.1%), and the median tumor mutation burden was 2 mut/Mb (IQR: 1-4). PD-L1 tumor proportion score was \u226550%, 1%-49%, and <1% in 11.4%, 54.2%, and 31.4%, respectively. Regarding treatment patterns, 74.2% of patients received chemotherapy (CT) plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in the first line, and 42.8% received antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting ERBB2 in further lines of therapy, especially trastuzumab emtansine (37.1%) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.7%). The median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) to the first line was 6.7 months (95%CI, 5.65-8.48). The median real-world overall survival (rwOS) for the entire cohort was 25.9 months (95% CI, 24.4-27.9). This study demonstrated that ERBB2-mutant NSCLC is uncommon among Latin American patients. Despite the vast majority of patients being treated with chemo-immunotherapy (ICB) in the first line, the median rwOS was similar to that reported for non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC.",

This multicenter, observational, real-world study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd for the treatment of Chinese patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low advanced BC. The medical records of 61 patients were collected from The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Beijing Chaoyang District Sanhuan Cancer Hospital, Beijing Jingxin Hospital, and Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), and safety. PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The primary endpoint, PFS was 10.51\u2009months (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.02-NE) in the HER2-low group and 10.18\u2009months (95% CI, 3.88-NE) in the HER2-positive group. Regarding the secondary endpoints in the HER2-low and HER2-positive groups, OS data were immature, ORR rates were 37.93% and 62.50%, DCR rates were 79.31% and 87.50%, and the median TTR rates were 1.28 and 1.31\u2009months, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, front-line treatment with T-DXd was associated with increased beneficial effects. The primary adverse events (AEs) related to T-DXd treatment were gastrointestinal reactions and bone marrow suppression, which were predominantly grades 1-2, with no severe grade 4/5 AEs reported, only one patient developed infectious pneumonia. This study was the first multicenter, real-world study of T-DXd for advanced BC in China. The findings demonstrated that T-DXd may be an effective antitumor treatment with controllable adverse reactions in patients with advanced BC irrespective of HER2 expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine resistance remains a significant therapeutic challenge in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the most common subtype, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. The interaction between ER and HER family receptors, particularly HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), drives resistance to standard therapies such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab by activating key signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK. Dysregulated miRNAs, which are non-coding gene expression regulators, have been linked to therapy response. To investigate the role of miR-99b-5p in ER-HER2/EGFR crosstalk in BT-474 cells. Experimental study. The expression profile and prognostic significance of miR- 99b-5p in breast cancer were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. BT-474 cells were transfected with miR-99b-5p mimics and inhibitors, followed by treatment with tamoxifen and trastuzumab to assess their impact on cell proliferation and ER-HER2/EGFR crosstalk. Western blotting was performed to quantify EGFR, HER2, and ESR1 protein levels. Real-time proliferation analysis evaluated changes in cell growth following miRNA transfection and drug treatment. The study revealed that miR-99b-5p is significantly overexpressed in tumors compared to normal tissues and is associated with poor patient survival and enhanced ER signaling. Transfection with miR-99b-5p mimics increased ESR1 expression and cell proliferation, even in the presence of tamoxifen or trastuzumab, indicating that miR-99b-5p contributes to therapy resistance through receptor crosstalk. Conversely, miR-99b-5p inhibition significantly restored drug sensitivity, reducing proliferation and enhancing the effectiveness of tamoxifen and trastuzumab. These findings establish miR-99b-5p as a key regulator of endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy resistance. Targeting miR-99b-5p could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to improve treatment outcomes in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer. Further research is needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and validate the therapeutic potential of miR-99b-5p inhibition in clinical applications.",

Preclinical studies that have directly compared PD-1 inhibitors support a differentiating profile associated with toripalimab compared to pembrolizumab and nivolumab with regard to their PD-1 binding sites, binding orientations, and impact on T cell function. Findings of similar or greater benefit among patients with low/no PD-L1 expression versus high/intermediate PD-L1 expression with toripalimab plus chemotherapy were also observed in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer for both overall survival and progression-free survival. However, determination of clinically-meaningful differences between PD-1 inhibitors requires sufficiently powered head-to-head RCTs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within one year postpartum. There is limited data on this, especially from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), warranting further exploration. Factors such as restricted healthcare access and resources\u00a0and cultural beliefs that influence awareness are the main barriers to LMICs. Study design This retrospective study included 44 adult patients aged 30 years and older. Only patients who received treatment and subsequent follow-up at our institution were included. The study was conducted at the Department of Medical Oncology, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore. The data were extracted from the hospital records over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020. Patients and methods A total of 44 patients were included, with a median age of 33 years. Eleven (25%) had triple-negative disease, 23 (52.3%) were hormone receptor (HR) positive and HER2 negative, three (6.8%) were HER2 positive and HR negative, and seven (15.9%) had triple-positive disease. A total of 81.8% presented with early-stage breast cancer (EBC) and received either neoadjuvant (n = 32) or adjuvant (n = 11) chemotherapy and surgery. Trastuzumab, tamoxifen, and radiotherapy were administered post-delivery. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using chi-square statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test. Survival analysis for overall survival and disease-free survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results At a median follow-up of 27 months, the estimated three-year event-free survival for EBC and locally advanced breast cancer was 82% (95% CI: 65.2-100) and 56% (95% CI: 42-75.6%), respectively, and 24% (95% CI: 10.1%-58.5%) for metastatic breast cancer. Of the 44 patients, 14 had\u00a0terminations, whereas 29 had full-term deliveries (FTDs). Patients with PABC\u00a0showed a 92.6-month mean survival, but tumor recurrence significantly impacted outcomes, with a 61.1% mortality rate and a reduced median survival of 44.5 months compared to 62.5 months in non-recurrent cases. Recurrence emerged as the strongest predictor of mortality. Conclusion Future research should improve PABC patient outcomes by improving diagnostic methods, refining treatment protocols, investigating long-term effects, developing early detection tools, tailoring treatment plans, and evaluating treatment impact on fetal health. It is essential to establish guidelines for mother and child safety and address emotional and psychological needs.",

    "title": "Exploring Zanidatamab's efficacy across HER2-positive Malignancies: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "HER2-positive cancers involve amplification or overexpression of the HER2 gene, leading to aggressive tumor growth across several cancer types, including breast, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Detection methods such as immunohistochemistry, next-generation sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization are used, with new advancements like biosensors and circulating tumor DNA offering improved diagnostic potential. Treatment strategies have evolved, including anti-HER2 drugs like trastuzumab and newer agents like zanidatamab, which show promise against HER2-positive malignancies. A comprehensive search of the following academic databases was performed including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. A detailed search string was made. Studies were selected based on whether they contained the keywords and if they reported the details of treatment for zanidatamab. A total of 16 studies were selected. Abstracts were independently examined by one author and critically reviewed by another and if there were any conflicting viewpoints they were discussed until consensus was reached. Zanidatamab has shown promising clinical outcomes in several HER2-positive cancers, including biliary tract, breast, gastric, and lung cancers, with high disease control rates and progression-free survival. Although it is not yet FDA-approved, it has received priority review for HER2-positive biliary tract cancer, with an FDA decision expected in November 2024. The safety profile of zanidatamab has been well-studied. The most common side effects include diarrhea, infusion reactions, and other mild to moderate treatment-related adverse events. In combination with Palbociclib for HER2-positive breast cancer, more severe side effects were observed, resulting in some patients discontinuing treatment. However, no treatment-related deaths have been reported across trials. While its anticancer efficacy and manageable safety profile are promising, long-term safety and efficacy data are still needed. Early clinical trials demonstrate strong efficacy, though some side effects, such as diarrhea and decreased ejection fraction, were noted. Future research should focus on understanding potential resistance mechanisms and establishing zanidatamab's broader role in the treatment landscape of HER2-positive cancers. In summary, zanidatamab has shown significant tumor response, progression-free survival, disease control, and improved quality of life in early trials, however, the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data remains a key limitation, requiring further research.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of highly cytotoxic drugs and are known as panaceas, completely changing the treatment paradigm for solid tumors. Compared with other anti-cancer drugs, do they have better efficacy and lower toxicity risks? It is necessary to summarize and analyze the published clinical research data in this area to provide additional evidence-based evidence for clinical practice. To comprehensively assess and overview the efficacy and safety of antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of solid tumors. An umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Systematic search of eight electronic databases and one registration platform including Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Web of Science (WoS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), Wan Fang Data, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) and international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) on Aug 1, 2024, to identify relevant systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Three authors completed research screening and data extraction independently. AMSTAR 2 was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) was performed to evaluate the quality of the evidence. We examined progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) as efficacy endpoints, and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) as safety profiles. A total of 16 eligible publications, including 32 clinical studies, were included in the umbrella review. The methodological quality of the included study was poor, with 2 articles of moderate-quality (12.5%), 5 articles of low quality (31.25%), and 9 articles of critically low quality (56.25%). Only one third of the evidence was of high quality. Within the included studies, breast cancer accounted for four-fifths, 2 studies were gastric cancer, and 1 study was a solid tumor. The overall results showed that ADCs significantly increased PFS and OS in patients with solid tumors, and the risk of toxicity was within an acceptable range. ado-Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) low/positive advanced metastatic breast cancer significantly prolonged PFS and OS, but the ORR showed a significant advantage. Compared with the chemotherapy group, T-Dxd significantly prolonged OS and PFS in gastric cancer patients, while T-DM1 did not. In other cancer types (ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and malignant pleural mesothelioma), ADCs tended to extend overall survival or progression-free survival compared with controls, but the difference was not statistically significant. Based on the available evidence, in breast cancer, ADCs were proved to with significant improvements in prolonging survival time and demonstrates a tolerable safety profile. Meanwhile, ADCs were proved to have enormous potential for the treatment of solid tumors. However, well-designed, multi-center RCTs need to further identify its potential in various solid tumors.

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged \u226580 years [y] are underrepresented in clinical trials. We evaluated whether age correlates with a distinct immunophenotype or impacts outcomes to first-line pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC, PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of \u226550%, and aged \u226580y. Three NSCLC cohorts were retrospectively analyzed to assess the impact of age (<80y versus \u226580y) on pembrolizumab efficacy and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cohort A encompassed patients receiving first-line pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 \u226550%. Cohort B comprised patients with tumor profiling using multiplexed immunofluorescence (ImmunoPROFILE). Cohort C included The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) databases for gene expression analysis. In Cohort A (N = 669), patients \u226580y (N = 111) showed no significant differences in objective response rate or median progression-free survival compared to younger patients (N = 558), but had shorter median overall survival and were less likely to receive second-line therapy after progression on pembrolizumab. In Cohort B (N = 567), tumors from patients \u226580y (N = 45) exhibited higher intratumoral FOXP3+ T cells and closer vicinity of PD-1+ immune cells to tumor cells compared to <80y (N = 522). Cohort C revealed a distinct immunophenotype in samples from patients \u2265 80y, with elevated specific immune cell subsets and up-regulated immune checkpoint proteins. Patients \u226580y with PD-L1-high NSCLC displayed a distinct immunophenotype in the TME but achieved similar ORR and mPFS with first-line pembrolizumab compared to younger patients. OS was shorter in older patients, who were less likely to receive second-line therapy.",

    "abstract": "Higher levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancers are associated with increased likelihood of pathologic complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) can augment immune responses to cancers, decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increasing T lymphocyte responsiveness. We have shown that the DNMTi decitabine augments the effectiveness of immunotherapy using murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. The primary objective was to determine whether DNMTi+immune checkpoint blockade would increase stromal TIL (sTIL) in primary breast cancers before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). In a phase 2 study (NCT02957968), patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer received window immunotherapy-decitabine (15 mg/m 46 patients (median age 54.5 years, range 28-72; 71.7% white, 28.3% black; 100% female) were treated. 21 patients had TNBC and received neither neoadjuvant pembrolizumab concurrently with NCT nor adjuvant pembrolizumab (Cohort A), 7 patients had TNBC and did receive concurrent and/or adjuvant pembrolizumab (Cohort A2), and 18 patients were estrogen receptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive and received neither concurrent nor adjuvant pembrolizumab (Cohort B). Blood samples collected after decitabine administration before pembrolizumab showed a 59% decrease (p<0.01) in monocytic MDSCs compared with baseline. 38 patients had paired biopsies for sTIL and 37 for PD-L1 evaluation. Cohorts A/A2 experienced an sTIL increase of 6.1% (p<0.008); Cohort B experienced an sTIL increase of 8.3% (p=0.006). PD-L1 expression increased by 73.9% (p<0.01). 14 of 43 patients (32.6%) who proceeded to resection achieved pCR (n=11 of 27 (40.1%) in Cohorts A/A2 and n=3 of 16 (18.8%) in Cohort B). The most frequently reported immune-related adverse events were adrenal insufficiency (AI) (n=6, 13.0%), maculopapular rash (n=3, 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (n=3, 6.5%). Five of the six AI instances were at least partially attributable to hypophysitis/pituitary dysfunction, and one remains uncertain. Treatment in the pre-neoadjuvant window with decitabine and pembrolizumab could sensitize breast cancers to standard NCT by recruitment of TILs to the tumor tissue. The treatment was well-tolerated.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab rezetecan (also known as SHR-A1811) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanised HER2-directed monoclonal antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. In the phase 1 portion of this phase 1/2 study, trastuzumab rezetecan showed preliminary anti-tumour activity and a favourable safety profile in patients with HER2-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We present phase 2 results from the study, which aimed to further evaluate the activity and safety of trastuzumab rezetecan at the recommended dose. In this multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial, conducted in 35 hospitals in China, we recruited patients aged 18-75 years, with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an activating HER2 mutation and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1, who had disease progression after or were intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 treatment or anti-PD-L1 treatment. Trastuzumab rezetecan was administered at 4\u00b78 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate assessed by an independent review committee in patients who received at least one cycle of study treatment. All patients who received at least one cycle of study treatment were included in safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04818333, and is ongoing but not recruiting. Between April 14, 2023, and Dec 14, 2023, 94 patients were enrolled and treated. 42 (45%) patients were male, 52 (55%) female, 92 (98%) were Han Chinese, and two (2%) were other ethnicity Chinese. At data cutoff (June 14, 2024), the median duration of follow-up was 8\u00b77 months (IQR 7\u00b70-10\u00b74). 69 (73%; 95% CI 63\u00b73-82\u00b70) of 94 patients had a confirmed objective response, as assessed by independent review committee. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (38 [40%] patients), decreased white blood cell count (25 [27%]), anaemia (22 [23%]), decreased platelet count (10 [11%]), and decreased lymphocyte count (seven [7%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 22 (23%) patients, which were decreased platelet count (six [6%]), decreased neutrophil count (six [6%]), interstitial lung disease (five [5%]), decreased white blood cell count (four [4%]), anaemia (four [4%]), vomiting (three [3%]), pneumonia (three [3%]), hyponatraemia (two [2%]), and pyrexia (one [1%]), small intestinal obstruction (one [1%]), nausea (one [1%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (one [1%]). There were no treatment-related deaths. Trastuzumab rezetecan showed clinically meaningful activity and manageable safety in patients with previously treated HER2-mutant NSCLC.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with elderly patients (aged >65 years) comprising a substantial portion of those affected. The treatment of breast cancer in this population is often complicated by frailty, comorbidities and polypharmacy. This review explores the application of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), in treating breast cancer among elderly populations. The underrepresentation of older patients in clinical trials complicates efficacy and safety assessments in this group. Current evidence indicates that ADCs are both effective and tolerable in elderly patients, demonstrating improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) alongside a manageable safety profile. Data from several trials like the EMILIA, TH3RESA and DestinyBreast studies demonstrate that T-DM1 and T-DXd maintained benefit in PFS and OS for HER2-positive breast cancer in older patients, despite a slight increase in adverse events. The ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials further confirm that SG provides significant improvements in PFS and OS in elderly patients at the cost of an increase in some toxicity. Emerging ADCs, including datopotamab deruxtecan and ARX-788, show promise but lack extensive geriatric-specific data. While the ADCs offer encouraging results in terms of efficacy and safety, with appropriate dose adjustments, further research is needed to optimize their use in elderly patients with breast cancer.",

Breast cancer cells often spread to the brain (brain metastases) or the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (leptomeningeal disease). Therapies to treat these serious conditions are limited. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which targets a protein called HER2 (found on the surface of breast cells to control their growth) and includes a powerful anti-cancer component to kill the tumor cells, has shown clinically meaningful results in both HER2-positive (high concentration of HER2 proteins) and HER2-low (low concentration of HER2 proteins) breast cancers. Interestingly, T-DXd has successfully worked in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal disease, but results in their HER2-low counterparts are limited. TUXEDO-4 is a medical study to evaluate the effectiveness of T-DXd in HER2-low breast cancer patients with recently diagnosed or worsening brain metastases, with or without aggressive leptomeningeal disease.

    "abstract": "HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is overexpressed in approximately 15-20% of breast cancers, leading to aggressive tumour growth and poor prognosis. Anti-HER2 therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, have significantly improved the outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer by blocking HER2 signalling. However, intrinsic and acquired resistance remains a major clinical challenge, limiting the long-term effectiveness of these therapies. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is essential for developing strategies to overcome it and improve the therapeutic outcomes. We generated multiple HER2-positive breast cancer cell line models resistant to trastuzumab and pertuzumab combination therapy. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify the mechanisms underlying resistance. Proteomic analysis identified 618 differentially expressed proteins, with a core of 83 overexpressed and 118 downregulated proteins. Through a series of advanced bioinformatics analyses, we identified significant protein alterations and signalling pathways potentially responsible for the development of resistance, revealing key alterations in the protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and signalling pathways, such as MAPK, TNF, and TGF\u03b2. These findings identify mitochondrial activity and detoxification processes as pivotal mechanisms underlying the resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, we identified key proteins, including ANXA1, SLC2A1, and PPIG, which contribute to the tumour progression and resistance phenotype. Our study suggests that targeting these pathways and proteins could form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "New breast cancer (BC) diagnoses will soon reach 2.5-3 million/year worldwide, with 15-25% of them being triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive type, characterized for lacking the main pharmacological targets: estrogen and progesterone receptors (ERs and PRs), as well as HER2 overexpression. Therefore, chemotherapy remains the almost-unique systemic treatment for TNBC. However, some targeted therapies are recommended for use in combination with chemotherapy; namely, PARP inhibitors for BRCA-mutated TNBC, the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, as well as the antibody-drug conjugates sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan, the latter for HER2low subtypes. Regardless of the limited benefits they provide, other treatments with similar mechanisms of action are being investigated in advanced clinical stages. Further, therapies that benefit other cancers, like PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and CDK4/6 inhibitors, are still being investigated for TNBC, although convincing results have not been obtained. Given this scenario, it might appear innovation for TNBC treatments has become stuck. However, the huge unmet medical need drives intense research into the biology of the disease. As a result, emerging disruptive therapies are being tested in early-stage trials, designed for novel targets and applying cutting-edge advances in immunotherapy and precision oncology.",

    "title": "Incidence and risk factors of trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction in a predominantly Hispanic South Texas population: a descriptive study.",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is often the first line treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. Although trastuzumab is effective, it has cardiotoxic effects and therefore requires cardiotoxicity monitoring via serial transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs). We aimed to evaluate risk factors for trastuzumab related cardiac dysfunction in a South Texas population that is uniquely a majority Hispanic population. A retrospective study was conducted of female patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who received trastuzumab treatment from 2015 to 2021. A total of 180 patients were identified. Patients without a baseline TTE and a baseline left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 53% were excluded. The final sample size included 132 patients. Cardiac dysfunction was defined as a drop in LVEF by more than 10% to less than 53% during the 1-year study period. The incidence of cardiac dysfunction was 6% in the study population. Hispanic/Latino patients composed 58% of the study population and represented 50% of patients who experienced cardiotoxicity. Of the patients who developed cardiotoxicity, 50% had hypertension, 25% had hyperlipidemia, 12.5% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 12.5% had previous coronary artery bypass grafts. A total of 12.5% had a history of radiation, 25% had a history of anthracycline therapy, 37.5% were former smokers, and 25% were former alcohol users. The incidence of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity in this Hispanic/Latino majority-minority population was 6%, which is surprisingly lower than the 9% cardiotoxicity rate observed in a predominantly white population in a previous study by Otchere et al., in 2023. Further studies are needed to determine the factors contributing to the reduced cardiotoxicity rate observed in this Hispanic population.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy (IO)-based strategies have been demonstrated to significantly prolong survival in the perioperative setting of non-oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The adoption of such strategies in clinical practice depends on heterogeneous regulatory approvals and on the agreement between medical oncologists and thoracic surgeons on patients' selection. An Expert Panel Meeting of medical oncologists and thoracic surgeons was held virtually by the Italian Association of Thoracic Oncology (AIOT) to discuss results of pivotal clinical trials with perioperative chemo-immunotherapy and reach agreement on open issues for the topic, formulating specific statements based on initially proposed discussion questions. Overall, panelists found agreement on seven statements. With regard to tissue and biomarker analysis, the role of increasing PD-L1 expression in predicting IO efficacy was recognized, whereas ctDNA and pCR were mainly attributed a prognostic role, in the absence of dedicated studies. The panelists acknowledged direct relationship between the benefit of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy approaches and the local burden of disease/mediastinal node involvement, supporting the inclusion of these factors, together with PD-L1, in selecting upfront surgery or induction treatment. The panelists agreed that the current literature data do not answer the issue of assessing the role of the adjuvant phase within a perioperative treatment strategy. Surgical considerations on the role of pneumonectomy and other approaches were also discussed. This experience highlights the importance of a synergistic approach between oncologists and surgeons to leverage the unmet needs in translating results of IO-perioperative clinical trials into clinical practice in patients with resectable NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a rare and challenging manifestation of advanced breast cancer (ABC) with severe morbidity and mortality. Patients with LM may be asymptomatic, or present with non-specific neurologic deficits, thereby possibly delaying diagnosis. Treatment typically requires a multimodal approach for effective management, symptom relief, and quality-of-life improvement. Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd), a humanized monoclonal antibody drug conjugate, demonstrated efficacy across diverse breast cancer subtypes expressing variable levels of HER2 proteins. Currently, T-DXd is the standard of care for patients with advanced, pretreated, HER2 low breast cancer. There is limited evidence of the response of brain metastases (BM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM) to T-DXd in HER2-low patients, with most data extrapolated from HER2-positive breast cancer studies. This case report presents the first documented instance of a patient with debilitating, symptomatic, untreated LM and hydrocephalus demonstrating a rapid and dramatic clinical response to T-DXd. This finding holds crucial clinical relevance, highlighting the potential benefit of initiating effective systemic therapy for LM early in treatment to address both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS disease burden, rather than delaying systemic therapy until after radiation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a major health challenge for women worldwide, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancers have a relatively high incidence and are highly aggressive. Targeted therapeutic agents, represented by trastuzumab, have been effective in improving the survival rate of HER-2-positive breast cancer patients. However, in clinical applications, this type of targeted drugs exhibits varying degrees of cardiotoxicity, and the mechanism of their cardiotoxicity is currently unclear. In this paper, we classify them into three categories: monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and antibody-drug conjugate (ADCs). We list the evidence of cardiotoxicity for various drugs based on current clinical trials and summarize their corresponding epidemiological profiles. We also discuss the regulation of cardiotoxicity from three perspectives: clinical biomarkers of cardiotoxicity, permissive cardiotoxicity, and the current status of cardiotoxicity regulation.",

    "abstract": "The study of DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02 demonstrated the favorable efficacy and optimal dosage of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in managing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had received previous treatment. The study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd in both the United States (US) and Chinese healthcare systems. Markov models were developed to evaluate the overall cost, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and life years (LYs) of treatment with T-DXd compared with docetaxel, nivolumab, and pyrotinib for patients in the US and China. The level of willingness-to-pay (WTP) in the US and China is 150,000/QALYs and 32,517/QALYs, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to ensure the precision of the model. T-DXd yielded additional QALYs of 0.63 and 0.06 with an ICER of $338997.84 and $1437258.33 per QALY, respectively, in the US compared to the docetaxel and nivolumab regimens. And T-DXd yielded additional QALYs of 0.63, 0.06, and 0.13 with an ICER of $137959.45, $623805.93, and $515447.12 per QALY, respectively, in China compared to the docetaxel, nivolumab, and pyrotinib regimens. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of drugs is the most influential factor. T-DXd provides substantial therapeutic benefit for NSCLC patients with HER2 mutations who have had previous treatment but is not deemed cost-effective in either the US or China when compared to docetaxel, nivolumab, and pyrotinib. Price reduction is perhaps the main way to make T-DXd cost-effective.",

    "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have gained much attention as non-viral gene delivery systems due to their large payload capacity, reduced immunogenicity, and cost-effective manufacturing. Surface modification of LNPs by covalent attachment of receptor ligands can improve their tissue specificity and reduce off-target effects. In the present work, DNA-LNPs were therefore designed to target breast cancer, particularly the invasive HER2-positive subtype. Targeting was mediated by trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) a monoclonal antibody binding to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2). To overcome intrinsic trastuzumab resistance for some patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, a dual-targeting strategy was employed by combining Herceptin with folate to enhance LNP uptake by cancer cells. Dual-targeted LNPs encapsulating plasmid DNA, coding for a fluorescent reporter protein (tdTomato or EGFP), were prepared using folate-conjugated PEGylated lipids. Subsequently, thiolated Herceptin was conjugated to the surface of the LNPs. At an N/P ratio of 6, small and uniform targeted LNPs were obtained, with a slightly negative \u03b6-potential. Cellular uptake and transgene expression were characterized invitro using three breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-mb453, SKBR3), which express varying level of the HER2 receptor. Cellular uptake correlated with HER2 expression levels and was significantly increased when Herceptin was combined with folate. In all tested breast cancer cell lines, dual-targeted LNPs led to an enhanced transgene expression compared to single-targeted LNPs. Furthermore, invivo zebrafish xenograft studies confirmed superior targeting and transfection efficiency of Dual-LNPs under physiological conditions. Our findings highlight the superior performance of dual-targeted LNPs to deliver a DNA expression plasmid to HER2 positive breast cancer cells, emphasizing their potential as an improved targeting and transfection strategy.",

We retrospectively reviewed all patients diagnosed with HR+/HER2- MBC metastatic breast carcinoma between 01/2023-12/2023 and characterized patients with HER2 Low, Ultralow, and Null results. 99 samples from 95 patients showed HR+/HER2- MBC.

Our one-year single-institution retrospective study shows majority of MBC are HR+/HER2 Low, followed by HR+/HER2 Ultralow.

    "title": "Comparative efficacy and safety of pyrotinib plus trastuzumab versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and trastuzumab monotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancer is an aggressive subtype that benefits from targeted therapies. Some studies have shown that pyrotinib (P) plus trastuzumab (H) has a good efficacy against early or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. However, there is still no systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib plus trastuzumab versus standard regimens in the neoadjuvant treatment of early or locally advanced breast cancer. This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab versus trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab (Per) and trastuzumab monotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wan Fang and VIP databases for relevant studies published up to August 30th, 2024. RCTs, cohort studies and retrospective studies with HER2-positive breast cancer patients who had not received breast cancer-related treatments previously were included. Treatment of P\u00a0+\u00a0H, H or Per\u00a0+\u00a0H arms with chemotherapy combined with pyrotinib plus trastuzumab, trastuzumab or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment. The primary outcome was the total pathological complete response (tpCR), and secondary outcomes included breast pathological complete response (bpCR), ORR, DCR, and grade III/IV AEs. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE. A total of nine studies (4 RCTs, 1 prospective cohort study and 4 retrospective analysis) involving 1745 patients were included. The P\u00a0+\u00a0H arm showed no significant difference in tpCR compared to Per\u00a0+\u00a0H (RR: 0.94, 95\u00a0% CI: 0.80-1.11, p\u00a0=\u00a00.46) but demonstrated a significant improvement in tpCR over trastuzumab monotherapy (RR: 1.83, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.56-2.15, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This finding was further confirmed in meta-analysis of RCTs (RR: 1.87, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.42-2.47, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The P\u00a0+\u00a0H arm had a higher incidence of grade III/IV diarrhea (RR: 10.54, 95\u00a0% CI: 5.96-18.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but similar rates of other AEs compared to the H arm. The evidence quality for tpCR (P\u00a0+\u00a0H vs. H, RCT) was high, and that for tpCR (P\u00a0+\u00a0H vs. H) was moderate, while that for tpCR (P\u00a0+\u00a0H vs. Per\u00a0+\u00a0H) was low. Pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab may offer an effective neoadjuvant treatment option for HER2-positive breast cancer, with a superior efficacy over trastuzumab alone. However, pyrotinib plus trastuzumab did not show better efficacy compared with Per\u00a0+\u00a0H. Pyrotinib plus trastuzumab was associated with more diarrhrea than trastuzumab monotherapy. In addition, P\u00a0+\u00a0H is less cost-effective compared with the combination of Per\u00a0+\u00a0H.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits low survival rates. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become first-line treatment for NSCLC, their limited response to ICI monotherapy has led to exploration of combination treatments. However, the high incidence of treatment-related adverse events associated with conventional drug combinations has highlighted the need for alternative herbal therapy. Bojungikki-tang (BJIKT), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used to treat gastrointestinal disorders and enhance immune function. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that BJIKT combined with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies exhibits significant efficacy in suppressing tumor growth by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Building on these preclinical findings, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BJIKT with pembrolizumab combination therapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. 70 individuals with stage IV NSCLC scheduled for first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy will be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The primary outcome will be progression-free survival, with secondary outcomes including disease control rate, overall survival, and quality of life assessment. Adverse events will be monitored for safety. This study will explore the synergistic mechanism of combinatorial therapy using immune profiling and multi-omics analysis, and the possibility for personalized integrative therapy based on cold-heat syndrome differentiation (SD) types in East Asian medicine. This study will provide novel evidence regarding survival outcomes, quality of life, and safety profiles of combined ICI and BJIKT therapy for advanced NSCLC. The exploratory data will contribute to tailoring treatments to immune-based SD types in NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T DXD), a new antibody drug conjugate is a new treatment option for 2nd line metastatic breast cancer (MBC) for HER2\u00a0+\u00a0or HER2 low tumors. Palliative or ablative radiotherapy (RT) may be required in patients who are being treated with T-DXd. However there is a lack of evidence regarding the safety profile of combining T-DXd with RT. TENDANCE study aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of combined T-DXd and RT. This retrospective multicenter study included 54 patients treated concurrently with T-DXd and RT for HER2+ and HER2 low MBC between February 2021 and December 2023. All data were collected from a web-questionnaire, centralized after medical records and validation of the protocol by the local ethical committee. Primary endpoint was the safety of combined therapy. Median age was 60 years. Patients who received T-DXD were further categorized into HER2+ (40.7\u00a0%), HER2 low/hormonal receptors HR+ (40.8\u00a0%) or HER2 low/HR- (18.5\u00a0%). In the HER2+ patients, T-DXd was administered as 2nd (18.2\u00a0%) or 3rd (31.8\u00a0%) or 4th (50\u00a0%) line therapy. RT was delivered using palliative (72.2\u00a0%) or ablative doses (27.8\u00a0%). Indications consisted mostly of palliative bone irradiation (46.3\u00a0%) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) (25.9\u00a0%). With the median follow-up of 9 months, 22.2\u00a0% of patients had a complete response and 77.8\u00a0% had either a partial response or stable disease. Grade 1 or 2 asthenia was observed in 51.8\u00a0% of patients, while only 16.6\u00a0% experienced other grade 1 or 2 adverse effects. There was no T-DXd therapy discontinuation related to RT. To our knowledge, TENDANCE is the largest study evaluating concurrent T-DXd and RT. This preliminary report suggests the feasibility of the combination of RT and T-DXd with manageable toxicity rate. Longer follow-up and further prospective studies are required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab has significantly improved the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting, where its combination with chemotherapy increases the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. This retrospective cohort study assesses the implications of disparities in access to trastuzumab within the Brazilian public healthcare system, focusing on pCR, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in non-metastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The study was conducted in the Hospital P\u00e9rola Byington (PEROLA), a public institution, and in the Hospital do Servidor P\u00fablico Estadual (HSPE), a private institution. pCR was defined as the absence of residual invasive or in situ tumors in the breast and axillary nodes. OS and DFS were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for a 5-year period. From 2011 to 2020, 381 patients at PEROLA and 78\u00a0at HSPE underwent NAC. Trastuzumab availability was higher at HSPE (83.4\u00a0% vs. 60.0\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Use of trastuzumab correlated with significantly higher pCR rates at both the PEROLA (54.3\u00a0% vs. 26.4\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and the HSPE (52.7\u00a0% vs. 26.4\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). HER2-positive patients with pCR at HSPE also had better OS (80\u00a0% vs. 61\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and DFS (89\u00a0% vs. 67\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) compared to those at PEROLA. There were significant differences in the provision of trastuzumab between the public and private healthcare systems, adversely affecting clinical outcomes and patient survival. The current data highlight the pressing need to address equity in cancer treatment to improve prognosis for every patient.",

    "abstract": "No treatment has been established for meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) in advanced metastatic breast cancer, and its prognosis is poor. In recent years, systemic therapies such as trastuzumab deruxtecan and tucatinib have been reported effective for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, however, these cannot be used for all MC. The difficulty in diagnosing and treating MC is attributed to its diverse pathology. As a result, in clinical practice, diagnosis is often delayed, and symptoms persist. This review focuses on whether neurological symptoms can be effectively alleviated even with unestablished treatments by classifying the pathology of MC into meningitis, hydrocephalus-related intracranial hypertension symptoms, focal brain damage such as epilepsy, cranial nerve disorders, and spinal cord symptoms and evaluating the diagnosis and condition. Hydrocephalus can be managed with drainage and ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery, and meningitis symptoms and cranial nerve disorders can be managed with whole brain radiotherapy. Antiepileptic drugs are essential for epilepsy, and supportive care is necessary, as are steroids for cranial nerve disorders. However, MC is not caused by a single condition but can occur in combination thus the therapeutic effectiveness of palliative therapy for neurological symptoms is currently unknown, and research is limited.

    "abstract": "Metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) is frequently observed in human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive breast cancer, leading to reduced quality of life and poor prognosis. Brain metastases (BMs) are common, whereas spinal cord metastases are rare and no standardized treatment approach has been reported for their management. Herein, we report the outcomes of treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in a patient with BMs and intramedullary spinal cord metastasis (ISCM) and another patient with BMs. The first patient was a woman in her 30s. After the surgery for HER2-positive right breast cancer, T-DXd was used as fourth-line treatment for multiple BMs and ISCM. Both the BMs and ISCM reduced, and partial response was maintained for 12 months. Grade 1 fatigue was the only adverse event observed in this patient. The second patient was a woman in her 40 s with multiple BMs after primary treatment for HER2-positive right breast cancer, as well as multiple bone and lymphoid node metastases. T-DXd was administered as second-line treatment. The multiple BMs have now shrunk, and the primary tumor and bone/lymph node metastases have not shown significant changes; the patient has maintained partial response for 6 months. Metastasis to the CNS has a very poor prognosis and limited therapeutic response because it is difficult for drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, T-DXd has yielded positive results for BMs in clinical trials. Additionally, a therapeutic effect of T-DXd on ISCM and BMs was observed in the reported cases.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy combined with anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy is currently a standard treatment for advanced HER2/HR-positive breast cancer (BC), although evidences showed that HR expression compromised effectiveness of the treatment. While cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy is a key therapy for the BC with HR expression, data on the effectiveness and safety of CDK 4/6 inhibitors combined with trastuzumab and endocrine therapy as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive and HR-positive metastatic BC are limited. Here, we report a case of a 46-year-old premenopausal woman diagnosed with stage 4 HER2/HR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma from both right and left breast with hypermetabolic activities in multiple lymph nodes, adrenal, bone, and skin. Due to the patient's refusal to use chemotherapy, she was started on goserelin, abemaciclib, letrozole, and trastuzumab. The patient's symptoms were relieved with near resolution of the primary breast mass and nearly all of the metastatic sites. Metabolic resolution was observed in bone lesions. The disease was under control for 57 weeks. During the treatment, neutropenia (grade 1-2) and anemia (grade 1) occurred, which spontaneously recovered. Additionally, diarrhea improved after symptomatic treatment. We believe that the combination of trastuzumab, hormone suppression, and abemaciclib is a practicable and effective treatment for HER2-positive and HR-positive metastatic BC in premenopausal patients who cannot tolerate the first-line chemotherapy.",

    "title": "Temporal and spatial composition of the tumor microenvironment predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has fundamentally changed cancer treatment. However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.",

Since 2017, targeted treatment options, such as olaparib, have been approved for the treatment of germline BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) mutated breast cancer, and immune checkpoint inhibitors for TNBC. A 45-year-old female was diagnosed with BRCA1 mutated TNBC and ovarian cancer in 2018, and adjuvant treatment was partially completed. In 2020, her CA-125 rose and olaparib was initiated. Due to tolerability, she stopped treatment and transitioned to surveillance. In 2021, imaging showed brain metastases, and she started capecitabine. In November 2021 she progressed and transferred care to us. Due to suspected dual metastatic TNBC and ovarian cancers, and ovarian tissue demonstrating a combined positive score (CPS) of 3, gemcitabine, carboplatin and pembrolizumab were initiated. After six cycles, imaging demonstrated resolution of brain lesions, and pembrolizumab maintenance was continued. In March 2023, she switched to carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab, due to suspected progression of her ovarian cancer and resolution of breast cancer.

Previous studies have shown varying effects of chronotherapy on survival rates, with some suggesting that a higher percentage of doses administered in the morning improves overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the timing of the first dose and the percentage of doses administered in the afternoon on survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients, as well as explore seasonal variations. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary cancer centre of patients diagnosed with NSCLC and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u226550% who received first-line palliative treatment with pembrolizumab or atezolizumab. Patients were categorized based on the timing of their first dose (before or after 14:30) and further stratified by the percentage of doses received after 14:30. To evaluate seasonal variance, patients were also stratified into two groups: those who received their first dose within three months before or after the winter solstice (\"Winter group\") and those who received it within three months before or after the summer solstice (\"Summer group\"). Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. We identified 349 patients who met the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in PFS or OS between patients receiving their first ICI dose before 14:30 (n=188) and those receiving it after 14:30 (n=161). However, a significant difference in OS was observed in patients who received more than 50% of their doses in the afternoon. Seasonal variations in dosing timing did not significantly impact survival outcomes. Our study suggests that the timing of the first ICI dose does not significantly affect survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients. However, patients receiving a higher percentage of their doses in the afternoon may experience poorer OS. Further prospective research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms before any changes to clinical practice can be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab (TRZ) is the first drug used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer, but some patients become resistant to it because of the PI3K/Akt pathway and other pathways that counteract it. TRZ, in conjunction with other therapeutic agents, is needed to overcome resistance. \u03b1-chaconine (CHA), a glycoalkaloid from the Solanaceae family, can suppress lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling, one of the key regulatory pathways in TRZ resistance. This study used integrative bioinformatics analysis to screen for possible targets of CHA that can help fight breast cancer that is resistant to TRZ. In vitro experiments were used to confirm the target genes using TRZ-resistant HCC-1954 (HCC-TRZ) cells for cytotoxicity, gene expression studies, and enzymatic assay. We identified several potential target genes of CHA, including EGFR, VEGF, ACHE, and ADORA. We generated HCC1954-TRZ cells, which showed an increase in cell viability after sequential treatment of the parental HCC1954\u00a0cells with TRZ. Further experiments showed the high sensitivity of HCC-TRZ toward TRZ when TRZ was combined with CHA. The combination of CHA and TRZ significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of various genes compared to a single TRZ treatment. Additionally, CHA alone and combined with CHA-TRZ inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in HCC-TRZ cells. CHA increased the sensitivity of HCC-TRZ cells to TRZ by targeting several potential target genes and AChE activity. This study highlights the potential of using CHA in combination with TRZ to overcome TRZ resistance in HER2+ breast cancer cells.",

We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of this treatment in a real-world setting. This multicenter observational study enrolled 95 consecutive cases of histologically diagnosed advanced or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS score\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0%, who received pembrolizumab as first-line treatment between February 2017 and December 2018. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. PD-L1 TPS scores were assessed immunohistochemically, using the 22C3 antibody. The median follow-up period was 71.1\u00a0months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.9\u00a0months (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]; 4.7-9.1\u00a0months), and the 2-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 24.9\u00a0%, 19.3\u00a0%, and 14.2\u00a0%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 19.1\u00a0months (95\u00a0%CI; 13.3-24.9\u00a0months). The 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 42.7\u00a0%, 33.9\u00a0%, and 24.8\u00a0%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Despite the development of HER2-targeting drugs such as trastuzumab and T-DXd, treatment resistance is a substantial challenge, often leading to relapse and distant metastasis. Tumor heterogeneity in HER2-positive breast cancer drives the evolution of resistant clones following therapeutic stress. However, the targetable drivers of anti-HER2 treatment resistance are not thoroughly identified. This study aims to use neoadjuvant-targeted therapy cohorts and a patient-derived organoid in vitro treatment model to uncover the potential targetable drivers of anti-HER2 treatment resistance. it is found that LINC01235 significantly enhances DNA replication licensing and chromosomal instability, fostering clonal expansion and evolution, and ultimately increasing resistance to therapeutic interventions. LINC01235 regulates global H3K27ac, H3K9ac, and H3K36me3 modifications, promotes H2A.Z expression in regulatory regions, and increases the accessibility of DNA licensing factors to their promoter regions. XRCC5 is identified as a key component for maintaining genomic stability, crucial for LINC01235's role in replication licensing. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies targeting LINC01235, including the use of antisense oligonucleotides or ATR inhibitors, which showed promise in overcoming treatment resistance are explored. These findings underscore the pivotal role of LINC01235 in driving resistance mechanisms and highlight novel avenues for targeted therapies to improve the outcomes of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Proteomics and metabolomics, integral combination of OMICs platform are gaining prominence in cancer research to enhance scientific knowledge of bio-molecular interactions occurs in the cellular processes during cancer progression. This approach designed to identify potential tools for addressing the complexities of this multifaceted disease. This analysis focussed on the intricate interplay between proteins and metabolites within cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment. By reviewing current proteomics and metabolomics studies, we aim to gain invaluable insights into tumour biology, progression, and its implication in therapeutic responses. This study highlights the importance of proteomics and metabolomics in discovering therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for targeted cancer treatment. Proteomics facilitates the analysis of protein expression, modifications and interactions, exemplified by the identification of HER2 mutations leads to development of breast cancer hence targeted therapies like trastuzumab could be initiated. Metabolomics reveals metabolic alternations such as elevated 2-hydroxyglutarate levels in gliomas linked to cancer progression and treatment resistance. The integration of these approaches clarifies complex signalling network driving oncogenesis and paves the way for innovative cancer therapies, including immune cheque point inhibitors. Proteomics and metabolomics have revolutionised cancer biology by revealing intricate signalling networks, metabolic dysregulations, and unique molecular alterations. This information is crucial for early cancer identification and prognosis, and for designing personalized therapeutic strategies. Innovative technologies like artificial intelligence and high-throughput mass spectrometry further enhance the potential of these studies. Fostering multidisciplinary collaboration and data-sharing is essential for maximising the impact of these approaches to cure as well as better management of the cancer.",

Biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of Luminal-HER2 type invasive ductal carcinoma. Chemotherapy was initiated with a regimen of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. Initially, the tumor flattened and significantly decreased in size. However, after 9 months of treatment, disease progression occurred, leading to sequential changes in the treatment regimen to T-DM1 and T-DXd. Despite these efforts, the tumor continued to grow rapidly. At 13 months after starting chemotherapy, the treatment effect was unsatisfactory, prompting a decision to perform a total mastectomy, including resection of the right breast tumor and the pectoralis major muscle, followed by skin grafting. The histopathological effect of the treatment was judged as Grade 1b, with intermediate tumor margins. Postoperatively, the patient received radiation therapy to the chest wall, followed by continued treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

This study aimed to compare the treatment response and real-world outcomes of NIC with the current standard of care pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (PC) in PD-L1 negative mNSCLC patients treated in clinical practice and to compare these outcomes with the results of the Checkmate-9LA trial. All mNSCLC patients with PD-L1<1% treated with NIC or PC at 2 large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands between 2019 and 2023 were included. The objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment characteristics of patients treated with NIC were compared to those of patients treated with PC. Additionally, the real-world outcomes of NIC were compared to the results from the CheckMate 9LA trial. A multivariate Cox regression was used to calculate PFS hazard ratios (HR). PD-L1 negative mNSCLC patients treated with NIC had a higher ORR than those treated with PC (41% versus 27%, P = .08). The PFS was slightly longer for patients treated with NIC versus PC (5.5 vs. 4.5 months, aHR = 0.91 [95% CI 0.59-1.58]), although not statistically significant. The treatment discontinuation rates were comparable between the real-world NIC and PC cohorts (72% vs. 68%), mostly due to disease progression (67% vs. 64%). The outcomes for patients treated with NIC in clinical practice were comparable to the Checkmate-9LA trial. For mNSCLC patients with <1% PD-L1 expression, the treatment responses to NIC were numerically better than to PC. Larger cohorts with longer follow-up periods and overall survival endpoints are needed to further establish the role of NIC in PD-L1 negative patients.",

    "abstract": "For patients with early ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-positive breast cancer, there is a need to identify biomarkers to guide treatment de-escalation. To evaluate the association of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with distant disease-free (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with ERBB2-positive early breast cancer. The ShortHER randomized clinical trial was a multicentric trial in Italy that enrolled patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer from December 2007 to October 2013. Patients received 9 weeks or 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy. Tumor samples were evaluated for TILs. Herein, patients were evaluated at a median follow-up of 9 years, and data were analyzed from February 2023 to August 2024. Four cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by 4 courses of taxanes combined with trastuzumab for 1 year (long arm) or 3 courses of taxanes combined with trastuzumab for 9 weeks followed by reduced-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy for 3 courses (short arm). The association of TILs with DDFS and OS was assessed with Cox models. Of 1253 patients enrolled in the ShortHER trial, 866 women (median [IQR] age, 56 [48-64] years) had evaluable TILs. In Cox models with relevant factors, each 5% TIL increment was associated with improved DDFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and OS (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The 10-year OS rate was 91.3% for patients with TILs 20% or higher, 93.3% for patients with TILs 30% or higher, and 98.1% for patients with TILs 50% or higher, resulting higher vs lower TIL counterparts. Patients with TILs lower than 20% showed a better outcome with the long vs short treatment (10-year DDFS, 88.7% vs 81.0%), whereas patients with TILs 20% or higher showed the opposite (10-year DDFS, 87.1% vs 92.2%; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.01). Similarly, patients with TILs 20% or higher had a 10-year OS rate of 89.3% in the long arm vs 93.1% in the short arm (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.10-1.36); patients with TILs lower than 20% had a 10-year OS rate of 91.3% in the long arm vs 86.9% in the short arm (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.82-2.23; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.06). This follow-up analysis of the ShortHER randomized clinical trial is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of an independent effect of TILs in terms of OS for patients with ERBB2-positive early breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and anti-ERBB2 therapy. Patients with TILs 20% or higher who de-escalated trastuzumab duration and chemotherapy dose were not exposed to an excess risk of distant relapse or death. EudraCT: 2007-004326-25.",

    "abstract": "Systemic corticosteroids (SCs) are associated with reduced survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy. However, the current first-line standard of care usually involves combined chemotherapy (CT) and ICIs, and the effect of SCs on survival under combined CT and ICI has never been studied. To investigate the association between SC therapy and survival under CT-ICI in advanced-stage NSCLC patients. We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all advanced-stage NSCLC patients receiving first-line CT-ICI. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to SC exposure status (\u2a7e10\u2009mg/day), adjusted in a multivariate Cox model for the following confounders: age, performance status, hospital admission prior to treatment, number of metastatic sites, brain metastases, bone metastases, PD-L1 status, and histological subtype. Multivariate analyses also explored the association between dosage and SC exposure duration and PFS. Of the 193 included patients, 43 (22.3%) were receiving SCs, mainly because of symptomatic brain metastases (in 25/43 cases, 58%). In multivariate analysis, SC therapy at a 10\u2009mg/day threshold was not associated with PFS (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-2.03,  In this group of patients receiving first-line CT-ICI for advanced NSCLC, SCs at \u2a7e60\u2009mg/day were associated with shorter PFS, but lower doses were not. Prolonged SC therapy prior to CT-ICI was associated with shorter PFS. Larger studies are required to confirm these results.",

    "abstract": "Brain metastasis occurs in about 50% of all women with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer and confers poor prognosis for patients. Despite effective HER2-targeted treatments of peripheral HER2+ breast cancer with trastuzumab and HER2 inhibitors, limited brain permeability renders these treatments inefficient for HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis. The scarcity of suitable patient-derived in vivo models for HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis has curtailed the study of molecular mechanisms that promote growth and therapeutic resistance in brain metastasis. In this study, we generated and characterized a luminal B HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis cell model (BCBM94) isolated from a patient with HER2+ brain metastasis. Repeated hematogenic xenografting of BCBM94 consistently generated breast cancer brain metastasis in mice. The clinical receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi) lapatinib blocked phosphorylation of all ERBB receptors (ERBB1-4) and induced the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in BCBM94. Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1), an ERBB3/ERBB4 ligand that is abundantly expressed in the brain, abrogated lapatinib-induced apoptosis in HER2+ BCBM94 and BT474 models. ErbB3 signaling pathways that involved PI3K-AKT and the phosphorylation of BAD at serine 136 to prevent apoptosis were essential for Nrg1-induced survival. High-throughput RTKi screening identified the brain-penetrant pan-ErbB inhibitor poziotinib as a highly potent compound that reduced cell viability in HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis in the presence of NRG1. Two weeks of poziotinib treatment successfully ablated BCBM94 and BT474 HER2+ brain tumors in vivo. In conclusion, this study established a patient-derived HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis model and identified poziotinib as a highly efficacious RTKi with excellent brain penetrability that eliminated HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis. Significance: Development of a preclinical patient-derived model to study HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis enabled the identification of the irreversible pan-ERBB inhibitor poziotinib as highly efficacious in treating brain metastatic tumors.",

    "abstract": "Data regarding the use of rechallenge trastuzumab (RTmab)-based therapies in the management of heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) in the literature are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab-based therapy in patients who experienced disease progression after receiving lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC). In this retrospective study, the data of thirty three HER2 positive metastatic BC patients who progressed after LC treatment and subsequently received trastuzumab-based treatment were evaluated. Trastuzumab was administered at an initial loading dose of 8\u2009mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 6\u2009mg/kg every 21 days. The average age of patients is 47 years (range 25-72 years). The predominant histopathological subtype was invasive ductal carcinoma, which was observed in 23 (70%) patients. Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity was also noted in 16 (48%) patients. All patients had received palliative trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (Cht) before the lapatinib. In conjunction with trastuzumab-based therapy, vinorelbine was administered to 14 (42%) patients, paclitaxel to 12 (36%), and other chemotherapeutic agents to 4 (12%). For all patients, the objective response and disease control rates were 27% and 69%, respectively. Furthermore, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-11), and the median overall survival was 20 months (95% CI: 15.1-25.8). There were no statistically significant differences in PFS rates based on several factors, including age, ER status, denovo metastasis, brain metastasis, perioperative Cht, pre-Rtmab hormone therapy, and which Cht was used along with Rtmab (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Mild to moderate adverse events were observed in 17 (52%) patients, whereas only 4 (12%) patients had Grade 3 to 4 toxicity. This study demonstrated that RTmab-based therapy is effective in patients who progressed after LC. These findings contribute to the literature by suggesting that RTmab is a viable treatment option for patients with HER2-positive metastatic BC.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the long-term cardiac effects of trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in early breast cancer (EBC) survivors. We extend the original MANTICORE trial which showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and beta-blockers (BB) could mitigate the decline in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) during the first year of trastuzumab treatment. We hypothesized that, over time, cardiac function would decline further and adverse changes in cardiac geometry would occur due to the aging of the population and prior treatment. The study enrolled 52 participants from the original MANTICORE trial cohort, with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging conducted at a median of 6.5\u00a0years post randomization to treatment. We found that, contrary to the hypothesis, participants maintained LV EF over the follow-up period. Specifically, the placebo group exhibited a recovery in LV EF to levels comparable with the treatment groups, suggesting no long-term differential impact on cardiac function. However, a significant reduction in LV mass was observed across all groups, the clinical implications of which remain unclear. The findings suggest that in a selected population receiving trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, extended cardiac imaging surveillance beyond one-year post-treatment may be unnecessary. We posit that the presence of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer influenced hypertrophic changes to cardiac geometry observed at baseline and one year, which resolved after completing HER2-blocking treatment. The study also highlights the need for further research to understand the significance of changes in cardiac geometry during and after breast cancer treatment\u200b.",

    "abstract": "Despite treatment advances for patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR)-low/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, treatments that improve clinical outcomes while mitigating toxicity are needed. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody attached via a plasma-stable cleavable linker to a topoisomerase-I inhibitor payload, has shown efficacy alone or in combination with durvalumab, a selective, high-affinity anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, in early-phase clinical studies. The primary objective of TROPION-Breast04 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant Dato-DXd plus durvalumab followed by adjuvant durvalumab with or without chemotherapy versus standard of care in patients with previously untreated early-stage TNBC or HR-low/HER2- breast cancer. This is an ongoing, international, phase III, open-label, randomized controlled study. Approximately 1728 patients (aged \u2a7e18\u2009years) will be randomized 1:1 to eight cycles of neoadjuvant Dato-DXd (6\u2009mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3\u2009weeks (Q3W)) plus durvalumab (1120\u2009mg IV Q3W) followed by nine cycles of adjuvant durvalumab (1120\u2009mg IV Q3W) with or without chemotherapy versus eight cycles of pembrolizumab (200\u2009mg IV Q3W) plus chemotherapy followed by nine cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab (200\u2009mg IV Q3W) with or without chemotherapy. Dual primary endpoints are pathological complete response by blinded central review and event-free survival by investigator assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (key), distant disease-free survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety. The study is approved by independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards at each study site. All patients will provide written informed consent. This study will evaluate the potential use of neoadjuvant Dato-DXd plus durvalumab followed by adjuvant durvalumab with or without chemotherapy versus standard of care in patients with previously untreated early-stage TNBC or HR-low/HER2- breast cancer. The findings of this trial could lead to promising treatment options for these patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06112379. TROPION-Breast04: a clinical study comparing datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) plus durvalumab before surgery followed by durvalumab with or without chemotherapy after surgery, versus standard of care treatment in people with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or hormone receptor (HR)-low/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2\u2212) breast cancer who have not received previous treatment People with TNBC have neither estrogen receptors and/or progesterone receptors nor a protein called HER2 expressed on their cancer cells. Standard treatment for early-stage TNBC that has not spread to other parts of the body and can be removed by surgery is pembrolizumab (a drug that makes cancer cells more susceptible to being killed by the immune system) plus chemotherapy before surgery, and pembrolizumab after surgery. People with HR-low/HER2\u2212 breast cancer (BC) do not have HER2 but have low levels of estrogen/progesterone receptors on their cancer cells and may be treated similarly to those with TNBC. Some people with high-risk early-stage TNBC or HR-low/HER2\u2212 BC experience a recurrence of their cancer after standard treatment. Therefore, new therapies that stop cancer returning and improve long-term outcomes are needed. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate that consists of an antibody (datopotamab) and an anticancer drug payload (DXd), joined via a stable cleavable linker. In people with TNBC that has spread to other parts of the body, promising outcomes have been observed with Dato-DXd alone or in combination with durvalumab (a drug that makes cancer cells more susceptible to being killed by the immune system). In the TROPION-Breast04 study, approximately 1700 people with early-stage TNBC or HR-low/HER2\u2013 BC who have not received previous treatment will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive Dato-DXd plus durvalumab followed by surgery and durvalumab with or without chemotherapy, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by surgery and pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy. TROPION-Breast04 will show if Dato-DXd plus durvalumab before surgery followed by durvalumab with or without chemotherapy after surgery can help people with early-stage TNBC and HR-low/HER2\u2013 BC live longer without their cancer returning versus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy before surgery followed by pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy.",

The emergence of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors offers new therapeutic options for patients with advanced NSCLC, but a comprehensive evaluation of their efficacy and safety is still lacking. In the present study randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 2005 to May 2023 were identified through searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase. Analysis focused on 10 PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for stages III and IV NSCLC in studies evaluating overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), the objective response rate, the disease control rate (DCR) and the incidence of severe treatment-related and immune-related adverse events. A total of 37 RCTs involving 31,779 patients were included in the analysis. Compared with chemotherapy, tislelizumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab all significantly improved OS, with tislelizumab showing the highest probability of being the best treatment for improving OS and DCR. While cemiplimab and tislelizumab had the highest probabilities of improved PFS, no significant differences were observed across all PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Combination therapies, such as nivolumab or cemiplimab with chemotherapy, increased OS and PFS but also increased the incidence of severe treatment-related adverse events. In particular, cemiplimab and pembrolizumab were associated with a greater risk of severe immune-related adverse events. In conclusion, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, especially tislelizumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, were effective first-line treatments for NSCLC, providing survival benefits. However, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with chemotherapy increased the risk of severe adverse events. Further research is needed to optimize treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration approved cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy (CCT) as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). However, whether CCT presents a cost-effective alternative to the previously preferred first-line treatment, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (PCT), remains uncertain. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CCT vs PCT as the first-line treatment for aNSCLC from a US health care payer perspective. A 3-state partitioned survival model with a 10-year horizon was constructed. Clinical data were derived from the EMPOWER-Lung 3, KEYNOTE-407, and KEYNOTE-189 trials. Costs and quality of life were obtained from published 2024 US list prices and literature. The cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. All outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Scenario analyses, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses were performed for patients with different programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels. In the base-case analysis, the total cost of PCT was $207,926 with 1.609 QALYs, whereas CCT had a total cost of $175,247 with 1.657 QALYs. Results from the scenario analyses were consistent with the base-case analysis, indicating that CCT was a dominant treatment strategy over PCT (ICER\u2009=-$675,304 per QALY). The cost of pembrolizumab highly impacted the ICER. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY, CCT would be accepted as a cost-effective option 96.9% of the time. In subgroup analyses, CCT remained a dominant alternative to PCT for patients with PD-L1\u2009levels of at least 50% and 1%-49%. This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that CCT is a dominant first-line treatment option for aNSCLC with PD-L1\u2009levels of at least 1% compared with PCT.",

This study assessed 5-year outcomes of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy in a large, multicenter, real-world cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS\u226550%, referred to as Pembro-real 5Y. Individual patient-level data (IPD) from the experimental arm of the KEYNOTE-024 trial were extracted (KN024 IPD cohort) to compare the long-term outcomes between the two cohorts. To further assess the reproducibility of clinical trial results, we reconstructed the \"KN024 look-alike\" cohort by excluding patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS)\u22652, those requiring corticosteroids with doses \u226510\u2009mg of prednisolone/equivalent, patients with positive/unknown epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase genotype, and those with pre-existing autoimmune disease. We additionally provided a hierarchical organization of determinants of long-term benefit through a conditional inference tree analysis. The study included 1050 patients from 61 institutions across 14 countries, with a median follow-up of 70.3 months. The 5-year survival rate was 26.9% (95% CI: 23.8% to 30.2%), and median OS was 21.8 months (95%\u2009CI: 19.1 to 25.7), while 32 (3.0%) patients who achieved a complete response remained progression-free at the data cut-off. The KN024 look-alike cohort had a 5-year survival rate of 29.3% (95% CI: 25.5% to 33.6%) and a median OS of 27.5 months (95%\u2009CI: 22.8 to 31.3). Neither the overall study population nor the KN024 look-alike cohort exhibited significantly different OS compared with the KN024 IPD cohort. By the data cut-off, 1015 patients (96.7%) had permanently discontinued treatment: 659 (64.9%) due to progressive disease, 156 (15.4%) due to toxicity, 77 (7.6%) due to treatment completion, and 106 (10.4%) due to other reasons. Overall, 222 participants (21.1%) were treated for a minimum period of 24 months, among them the 5-year survival rates were: 31.7%, 72.7%, 78.6%, 84.2% for patients who discontinued treatment due to progressive disease, toxicity, treatment completion, and other reasons, respectively. This study provides valuable real-world evidence that confirms the long-term efficacy of pembrolizumab outside of clinical trials. Hierarchical organization indicates ECOG-PS, age and PD-L1-TPS as the most important predictors of 5-year survival, potentially informing clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options for HER2-mutant patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are limited. New agents, including zongertinib, a HER2-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), are being investigated in clinical trials. However, published clinical data on the efficacy and safety of zongertinib are limited to data from a single phase I trial including only 36 patients with NSCLC. We report real-world data on six consecutive patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC who received zongertinib through a named patient use program between December 2023 and June 2024. Radiological response evaluation and blood testing were routinely performed every two to three months, and adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5. All patients were diagnosed with a metastatic adenocarcinoma, had previously progressed on at least one line of chemotherapy and had been previously treated with trastuzumab-deruxtecan (two had to stop treatment because of pneumonitis). Three patients (50%) presented with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \u22652. A clinical and radiological benefit was achieved in all patients (complete response (1), partial response (4), and stable disease (1)). In one patient with brain metastases, a complete response was achieved. Treatment with zongertinib is ongoing in all patients. Adverse events were reported in one patient (elevated blood pressure (grade 1). Zongertinib may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for HER2-mutant NSCLC patients even if they are heavily pretreated, have a reduced performance status or have a history of pneumonitis and brain metastases.",

Currently, there is limited understanding of pre-treatment risk factors for pneumonitis associated with T-DXd. Consecutive breast cancer patients who received at least one dose of T-DXd at a single academic cancer study between January 1, 2019, and February 20, 2024, were identified for analysis. Pneumonitis was documented by the treating oncologist at the time of toxicity and retrospectively independently confirmed by a member of the study team through chart and radiologic review. Pre-treatment variables of interest were collected, including patient demographics, radiation dosimetry variables, and chest imaging abnormalities. Of 179 total patients, 23 (12.8%) had pneumonitis after T-DXd exposure. Patients with pneumonitis had lower baseline oxygen saturation (98% vs. 97%, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and were more likely to have received abemaciclib (26.1% vs. 9.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.03) before T-DXd. Multiple pre-treatment variables were not found to be associated with T-DXd pneumonitis, including chest imaging abnormalities (41.9% vs. 47.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.59), prior immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (16.0% vs. 8.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.50) and prior chest or breast radiation (61.5% vs. 47.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.20). On multivariate analysis, prior treatment with abemaciclib remained significantly associated with T-DXd pneumonitis (OR 3.25 [1.07-9.11], p\u2009=\u20090.04), while neither pre-treatment chest imaging abnormalities nor prior chest or breast radiation were associated (OR 1.60 [0.62-4.20], p\u2009=\u20090.33); OR 0.51 [0.20-1.33], p\u2009=\u20090.17). In this cohort, prior treatment with abemaciclib may be a risk factor for T-DXd pneumonitis. Conversely, pre-treatment chest imaging abnormalities, prior immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, and prior chest or breast radiation did not increase the risk of T-DXd pneumonitis. Larger studies are warranted to validate these findings toward an improved understanding of risk factors for pneumonitis after T-DXd exposure.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive improvements achieved by endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and the forthcoming availability of alternative endocrine manipulations and targeted therapies, hormone-receptor positive/HER2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) is almost inevitably destined to become endocrine- refractory. At this time chemotherapy has been recently challenged and partly replaced by new targeted options as antibody-drug conjugated (ADCs). Trastuzumab-deruxtecan has been proven meaningfully superior to chemotherapy either in 1st and later lines after progression to CDK4/6i in HER2-low ABC and results with other ADCs as Sacituzumab Govitecan and Datopotamab-deruxtecan are promising, but the definition of cross-resistance between these drugs sharing either antibody or payload is crucial before implementing them in a useful sequence. While PARP inhibitors are the standard 2nd line in patients with gBRCA mutation, it is not still known whether patients with mutations of PALB2 or of other homologous recombinant defect (HRD)-related genes will benefit of the same treatment. On the other hand, the results obtained with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in HR+\u202f/HER2-ABC contrarily to the early setting are disappointing up to now, but investigations of ICIs in combination with other targeted drugs which may increase immune response and the search for better markers of activity are under way. Moreover the anticipation in upfront treatment of ADCs or PARPi in patients with features of putative endocrine resistance and/or of less sensitiviy to CDK4/6i and the choice of therapy in patients recurring during or soon after adjuvant CDK4/6i and olaparib represent further challenges for the future.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor-low (ER-low) breast cancer (BC) present clinicopathological features and disease behavior resembling triple-negative breast cancer, but have been frequently excluded from pivotal trials designed for the latter. Since neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (P\u2009+\u2009CT) is the new standard of care for stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we aimed to access the effectiveness of this therapy for ER-low tumors. We evaluated patients with ER-low BC included in the Neo-Real/ GBECAM-0123 study, a real-world data study evaluating patients treated with neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT since July 2020 across ten cancer centers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT through pathologic complete response (pCR). Twenty patients were included in this analysis. Median age was 40\u00a0years (range 28-64). Most patients had grade 3 tumors (n\u2009=\u200918, 90%), with a median Ki67 index of 75% (range 30-95%), and 70% had stage II tumors. All the twenty patients were submitted to surgery, with a pCR observed in 12 cases (pCR rate of 60%). Receiving less than 6 cycles of pembrolizumab was associated with a trend towards worse pCR rates (20% vs 73.3%). The clinicopathological features and the response to neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT observed in this ER-low BC cohort are similar to that observed in TNBC. Patients with stage II-III ER-low/HER2- BC should be treated with neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT following the treatment standards for TNBC, and proper adherence to the regimen is relevant to improve effectiveness.",

We evaluated the HLA genotype of the germline and available tumor samples in 42 patients with programmed death-ligand 1 expression of 50% or higher undergoing pembrolizumab immunotherapy. The HLA allele expression was correlated with tumor response, disease survival, and the occurrence of pneumonitis. It was observed that the germline HLA-C homozygosity and HLA-DRB1\u221713 expression were related to a worse progression-free survival and treatment response. Importantly, all patients (7/7 patients) who developed pneumonitis in our cohort expressed the HLA-DPB1\u221702 allele, and the incidence of pneumonitis was 31.8% (7/22 patients) in patients expressing this allele compared with 0% (0/20 patients) in those without this allele ( Taken together, this study evaluated the impact of HLA status in both germline and tumor samples in patients with NSCLC with high programmed death-ligand 1 expression, and the high incidence of immunotherapy-induced pneumonitis in patients expressing the HLA-DPB1\u221702 allele may suggest a routine HLA typing and closer monitoring in this patient subset.",

    "abstract": "In the randomized phase III TASUKI-52 trial, nivolumab with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab significantly prolonged the progression-free survival (PFS) of treatment-naive patients with advanced or recurrent nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we report the long-term outcomes of patients treated with nivolumab plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with 3\u00a0years of follow-up. Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations were randomized (1:1) to receive either nivolumab or placebo, in addition to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, every 3\u00a0weeks. Treatment was continued for a maximum of six cycles. The endpoints included PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory analyses included efficacy and safety in subgroups. A total of 550 patients were randomized to the nivolumab arm (n\u00a0=\u00a0275) and placebo arm (n\u00a0=\u00a0275). At the minimum follow-up of 36.1\u00a0months, PFS was consistently longer in the nivolumab arm than in the placebo arm (median, 10.6 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.73; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), with PFS rates of 20.2\u00a0% vs. 4.9\u00a0%. The median OS was 31.6\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI, 26.8-36.5) in the nivolumab arm and 24.7\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI, 21.1-28.0) in the placebo arm (HR, 0.71; 95\u00a0% CI, 0.57-0.88), with OS rates of 44.2\u00a0% and 32.3\u00a0%, respectively. Of note, PFS and OS favored the nivolumab arm across patients with different PD-L1 expression levels, and regardless of baseline brain metastasis status. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 76.2\u00a0% and 74.9\u00a0% of the patients in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively, while no new safety concerns were identified. Nivolumab, in addition to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, remained to demonstrate significantly longer PFS and long-term OS benefit compared with placebo in the first-line treatment of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.

    "title": "Evidence for cytoprotective autophagy in response to HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies.",
    "abstract": "The advent of HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab has significantly improved the clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2 and, more recently, also for gastric cancers. However, the development of resistance, as is frequently the case for other antineoplastic modalities, constrains their clinical efficacy. Multiple molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways have been investigated for their potential involvement in the development of resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, among which is autophagy. Autophagy is an inherent cellular mechanism whereby cytoplasmic components are selectively degraded to maintain cellular homeostasis via the generation of energy and metabolic intermediates. Although the cytoprotective form of autophagy is thought to predominate, other forms of autophagy have also been identified in response to chemotherapeutic agents in various tumor models; these include cytotoxic, cytostatic, and nonprotective functional forms of autophagy. In this review, we provide an overview of the autophagic machinery induced in response to HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies, with a focus on trastuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine, in an effort to determine whether autophagy targeting or modulation could be translated clinically to increase their effectiveness and/or overcome the development of resistance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This manuscript is one in a series of papers that interrogate the role(s) of the autophagy induced in response to antineoplastic agents in various cancer models. This series of papers was developed in an effort to establish whether autophagy targeting or modulation is likely to be an effective adjuvant strategy to increase the efficacy of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. This review explores the relationship between the autophagic machinery and HER2-targeted therapies.",

    "title": "Targeting PCSK9, through an innovative cVLP-based vaccine, enhanced the therapeutic activity of a cVLP-HER2 vaccine in a preclinical model of HER2-positive mammary carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "HER2-targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients, leading to significant improvements in tumor response rates and survival. However, resistance and incomplete response remain considerable challenges. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of dyslipidemia by enhancing the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptors, however recent evidence also shows links between PCSK9 and cancer cells. We present an innovative immunization approach combining capsid virus-like particle (cVLP)-based vaccines against HER2 and PCSK9. The therapeutic activity of the combined vaccine was evaluated in female mice challenged with HER2-positive mammary carcinoma cells. Controls included untreated mice and mice treated with cVLP-PCSK9 and cVLP-HER2 as standalone therapies. Antibodies elicited by vaccinations were detected through ELISA immunoassay. The functional activity of the antibodies was tested in 3D-soft agar assay on human HER2\u2009+\u2009\u2009+\u2009\u2009+\u2009trastuzumab sensitive and resistant cells. Mice vaccinated with cVLP-HER2\u2009+\u2009cVLP-PCSK9 displayed tumor regression from the 40th day after cell challenge in 100% of mice remaining tumor-free even 4\u00a0months later. In contrast, 83% of mice treated with cVLP-HER2 vaccine alone experienced an initial tumor regression, followed by tumor relapse in 60% of subjects. Untreated mice and mice treated with the cVLP-PCSK9 vaccine alone developed progressive tumors within 1-2\u00a0months after cell injection. The combined vaccine approach elicited strong anti-human HER2 antibody responses (reaching 1-2\u00a0mg/ml range) comprising multiple immunoglobulins isotypes. cVLP-PCSK9 vaccine elicited anti-PCSK9 antibody responses, resulting in a marked reduction in PCSK9 serum levels. Although the anti-PCSK9 response was reduced when co-administered with cVLP-HER2, it remained significant. Moreover, both cVLP-HER2\u2009+\u2009cVLP-PCSK9 and cVLP-HER2 alone induced anti-HER2 antibodies able to inhibit the 3D growth of human HER2\u2009+\u2009\u2009+\u2009\u2009+\u2009BT-474 and trastuzumab-resistant BT-474 C5 cells. Strikingly, antibodies elicited by the combined vaccination were more effective than those elicited by the cVLP-HER2 vaccine alone in the inhibition of trastuzumab-resistant C5 cells. The results indicate that cVLP-PCSK9 vaccination shows adjuvant activity when combined with cVLP-HER2 vaccine, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy against HER2-positive breast cancer and holding promise in overcoming the challenges posed by resistance and incomplete responses to HER2-targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Although there are a number of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combinations that can be applied to the treatment of perioperative non-small cell lung cancer patients, the optimal treatment combination strategy has not yet been determined. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.go and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from major international conferences for literature related to neoadjuvant immunotherapy combinations published as first-line treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer from the start of the library to 20 February 2024, and performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We analyzed nine studies involving 3431 patients, including eight perioperative neoadjuvant immunotherapy combinations for non-small cell lung cancer. For patients without programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) selection, Toripalimab plus chemotherapy provided the best Pathological complete response (PCR) benefit (OR\u2009=\u200932.89,95% CI:7.88-137.32), best Major Pathological response (MPR) benefit (OR\u2009=\u200910.25, 95% CI: 5.81-18.10) and best Event-free survival (EFS) benefit (HR\u2009=\u20090.40,95% CI: 0.28-0.57). Nivolumab plus chemotherapy provided the best surgical resection rate (OR\u2009=\u20091.71, 95% CI:0.87-3.40) and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy provided the best R0 surgical resection rate (OR\u2009=\u20092.20, 95% CI:1.28-3.79). In contrast, the combination of ipilimumab, nivolumab and chemotherapy, and the combination of toripalimab and chemotherapy were associated with the lowest incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above during neoadjuvant therapy. Our findings suggest that: Toripalimab plus chemotherapy showed better neoadjuvant efficacy and may have an overall survival benefit, but also increased the incidence of serious adverse events during neoadjuvant therapy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the UAE and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Although early diagnosis contributes to favorable prognoses, novel treatment modalities like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have significantly broadened the therapeutic landscape for patients in metastatic settings. The recognition of \"HER2-low\" expression as a targetable category has caused a paradigm shift in the management of breast cancer. Although initially developed to target HER2-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an ADC, has now also been approved to treat metastatic or unresectable HER2-low breast cancers. Despite the inherent specificity of an ADC, the risk of off-site toxicity exists and is an essential component while assessing the risk-benefit ratio of the treatment. Developing strategies to balance efficacy and safety is crucial, especially for newly approved therapies like T-DXd. Regional perspectives, cultural beliefs, and demographic factors influence treatment decisions and outcomes. The objective of this paper is to establish a UAE-specific consensus among oncologists on practical T-DXd treatment considerations and management of associated side effects. Establishing a consensus on monitoring and managing T-DXd side effects among experts can promote informed decision-making.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the analytical and clinical validity of the approved (United States and Japan) plasma-based Guardant360 companion diagnostic (CDx) test for selecting patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 [ERBB2])-mutated (HER2m) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) treatment. Concordance between the Guardant360 CDx test and the plasma-based AVENIO ctDNA Expanded Kit Assay (AVENIO), as well as the tissue-based clinical trial assays (CTAs) was investigated. Clinical utility was assessed by comparing T-DXd clinical efficacy results of patients in DESTINY-Lung01/02 who tested positive for HER2 mutations using the Guardant360 CDx test to benchmark efficacy results from DESTINY-Lung01/02. Finally, concordance between the Guardant360 CDx test and the tissue-based Oncomine Dx Target (ODxT) test was explored. High concordance was observed between the Guardant360 CDx test versus AVENIO [positive percent agreement (PPA), 98.8%; negative percent agreement (NPA), 91.5%] and CTAs (DESTINY-Lung01 Cohort 2-PPA, 91.0%; NPA, 100%; DESTINY-Lung02 arm 1-PPA, 86.0%; NPA, 100%). Confirmed objective response rates were similar in patients with HER2m NSCLC identified by the Guardant360 CDx test and by CTAs. There was a high level of agreement between the Guardant360 CDx test and the ODxT test. The Guardant360 CDx test demonstrated analytical and clinical validity for identifying patients with HER2m NSCLC for T-DXd therapy; results support plasma-based testing when tissue-based testing is not feasible.",

    "title": "Very Early Health Technology Assessment for Potential Predictive Biomarkers in the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing treatment is currently prescribed as first-line treatment for all patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver mutations. However, only 30-45% of patients show no progression within 12 months after treatment start. Various biomarkers are being studied to save costly and potentially harmful treatment in non-responders. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of implementing a hypothetical predictive biomarker for ICI-containing treatment response compared with standard of care (e.g., no implemented biomarker) for pembrolizumab-containing treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC in the Netherlands. Standard-of-care-based and predictive-biomarker-based strategies were compared using Markov models for three first-line pembrolizumab-containing treatments depending on a patient's tumor programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and histology. A Dutch healthcare system perspective was adopted. Assuming a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve of 1.0 in identifying responders, alternative treatments were offered for non-responders in the predictive-biomarker-based strategy. Parameters and assumptions were based on real-world data from surveys, literature using a targeted search, expert opinion, and registries. Outcomes included differences in costs, survival (life years (LYs)), and survival corrected for health-related quality of life (QoL) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the predictive-biomarker- and standard-of-care-based strategy. Implementing a predictive biomarker in pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment led to a mean survival reduction of 24 days (-\u20090.067 LYs) (18 days corrected for QoL (-\u20090.049 QALYs)), with cost savings of \u20ac22,606 compared with standard of care. Pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab-pemetrexed-platinum treatments showed survival reductions of 4.5 and 3.9 months, respectively (3.6 and 2.8 months corrected for QoL), with cost savings of \u20ac24,345 and \u20ac28,456. Sensitivity analyses confirmed consistent cost savings and survival reductions. Survival losses were mainly observed due to the lower survival rates associated with the alternative first-line treatment options available for non-responders in the predictive-biomarker-based strategy within each pembrolizumab-containing treatment regimen. Pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment also showed survival gains under certain conditions related to QoL and survival estimates. Our study highlights the importance of careful de-implementation of ICI-treatments in advanced NSCLC, balancing costs reductions and side effects without comprising survival. In the pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment regimen, the survival loss could be considered negligible. Future research should define acceptable tradeoffs and thresholds for de-implementation, considering factors such as survival of alternative treatments and responder classification to guide predictive biomarker implementation and optimize health resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "The potential benefits of pyrotinib for patients with trastuzumab-insensitive, HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer remain unclear. This prospective, multicentre, response-adapted study evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding pyrotinib to the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with a poor response to initial docetaxel plus carboplatin and trastuzumab (TCbH). Early response was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after two cycles of treatment. Patients showing poor response, as defined by RECIST 1.1, could opt to receive additional pyrotinib or continue standard therapy. The primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/isN0) rate. Of the 129 patients enroled, 62 (48.1%) were identified as MRI-responders (cohort A), 26 non-responders continued with four more cycles of TCbH (cohort B), and 41 non-responders received additional pyrotinib (cohort C). The tpCR rate was 30.6% (95% CI: 20.6-43.0%) in cohort A, 15.4% (95% CI: 6.2-33.5%) in cohort B, and 29.3% (95% CI: 17.6-44.5%) in cohort C. Multivariable logistic regression analyses demonstrated comparable odds of achieving tpCR between cohorts A and C (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.04, 95% CI: 0.40-2.70). No new adverse events were observed with the addition of pyrotinib. Patients with co-mutations of TP53 and PIK3CA exhibited lower rates of early partial response compared to those without or with a single gene mutation (36.0% vs. 60.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.08). These findings suggest that adding pyrotinib may benefit patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Further investigation is warranted to identify biomarkers predicting patients' benefit from the addition of pyrotinib.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1, encoded by PDCD1) regulatory network participates in glioblastoma multiforme development. However, such a network in trastuzumab-resistant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer remains to be determined. Accordingly, this study was aimed to explore the PD-1 regulatory network responsible for the resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab through a bioinformatics approach. The study used data mining tools like cBioportal and OMIM to identify genes involved in the programmed cell death-1-trastuzumab resistance regulatory network. The network was further examined using various tools like WebGestalt, DAVID, STRING, Cytoscape, CytoHubba, GEPIA, TNMPlot, and ROCPlot. The PDCD1 regulatory network in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer is linked to Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), interleukin (IL)-10, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC), and FCGR2B. These factors have a significant prognostic power in pathological complete response in breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab. Infiltration of B cells, CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages, and regulatory T cells is directly correlated with PTR expression. The study identified four genes (CTLA4, IL10, PTPRC, and FCGR2B) that are linked to the regulatory network of PD-1 in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells. Further research is needed to develop the therapeutic target against trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Receptor CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was evaluated as a target for detection and treatment of breast cancer. CDCP1 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in tumors from 423 patients [119 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); 75 HER2+; and 229 ER+/HER2-, including 228 primary tumors and 229 lymph node and 47 distant metastases). Cell cytotoxicity induced in vitro by a CDCP1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of the human/mouse chimeric antibody ch10D7 and the microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), was quantified, including in combination with HER-targeting ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Detection of CDCP1-expressing primary and metastatic xenografts in mice was examined by PET-CT imaging using zirconium-89-labeled ch10D7. The impact of ch10D7-MMAE on tumor burden and survival in vivo, including in combination with T-DM1, was quantified in cell line and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. CDCP1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of malignant cells of 70% of TNBC, 80% of HER2+ tumors, and increases in ER+/HER2- tumors from 44.9% in primary tumors to 56.4% in lymph node metastases and 74.3% in distant metastases. PET-CT imaging with zirconium-89-labeled ch10D7 is effective for the detection of primary and metastatic CDCP1-expressing TNBC in mice. ADC ch10D7-MMAE kills CDCP1-expressing cells in vitro and controls primary and metastatic TNBC xenografts in mice, conferring significant survival advantages over chemotherapy. It compares favorably to T-DM1 in vivo, and ch10D7-MMAE combined with T-DM1 showed the most potent efficacy, markedly reducing tumor burden of CDCP1+/HER2+ xenografts and prolonging mouse survival, compared with T-DM1 or ch10D7. CDCP1-directed molecular imaging has the potential to identify aggressive breast cancers for CDCP1-targeted treatment.",

    "abstract": "Primary breast squamous cell carcinoma (PBSCC) is a unique histopathological type of breast cancer. The majority of current case reports of PBSCC are triple-negative tumors with poor prognosis. Due to its heterogeneous clinical course, no unified management is achieved. Here, we report a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive case with good clinical outcome, which may contribute to the development of appropriate guidelines and imprecise management of PBSCC. A 45-year-old female presented with a painless mass in the medial-upper quadrants of right breast and the imaging examination suggested a malignant tumor. She received modified radical mastectomy and axillary sentinel lymph node dissection of the right breast, and the pathological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma with HER2 over-expression. Subsequently, she underwent post-operative chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, T-docetaxel and trastuzumab (AC-TH) and then received maintenance treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Clinical follow-up suggests that she had achieved clinical complete remission and has survived for over 4 years. The diagnosis of PBSCC relies on histomorphology, due to non-specific imaging manifestations. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining helps to clarify the pathological type, hormone receptor status, HER2 amplification and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which is essential for clinical decision-making. HER2-positive PBSCC patients can benefit from AC-TH chemotherapy and 1-year anti-HER2 therapy is necessary to good prognosis. If possible, dual anti-HER2 therapy combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is recommended. Finally, positive clinical prognosis of PBSCC may be attributed to early detection, immediate surgery, precise diagnosis and proper adjuvant treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is the preferred treatment approach for stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). Real-life data comparing regimens with or without anthracyclines combined with two HER2 drugs is lacking. We compared the efficacy and toxicity of two commonly used regimens. Retrospective data were collected on patients newly diagnosed with clinical stage II-III HER2-positive BC and treated at Sheba Medical Center, Israel, between September 2017 and June 2022 with either neoadjuvant DCbHP (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) or ACTHP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel trastuzumab pertuzumab). PCR (pathological complete response) (ypT0/isN0) was evaluated in both cohorts and according to HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (3+ or 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] positive), estrogen receptor (ER), tumor size and nodal status. The toxicity indices evaluated were reductions in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), dose reductions, hospitalizations and febrile neutropenia. Here, 106 received ACTHP and 73 received DCbHP. Median age at diagnosis, ER status, HER2 IHC (2+/FISH pos or 3+) and nodal status were balanced. PCR occurred in 63.1% of patients, 67.0% and 57.5% in the ACTHP and DCbHP groups, respectively ( PCR rates were similar overall between ACTHP and DCbHP; however, in the HER2 3+ subgroup, ACTHP demonstrated increased efficacy. DCbHP was significantly less cardiotoxic.",

NMA was executed using WINBUGS (Microsoft Excel). Three molecular subgroups were analyzed: HER2-low, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and the ESR1 mutation subgroup for selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). A total of 14 studies were included. In the HER2-low group, Sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan had a similar efficacy (HR, 95% CI): PFS (0.98; 0.63-1.43) and OS (1.08; 0.76-1.55). In PI3K/AKT/mTOR-altered cases, capivasertib was superior to alpelisib PFS (0.77; 0.53-1.12), and OS (0.80; 0.48-1.35). SERDs had worse PFS and OS versus ongoing CDK 4/6i (ribociclib). No therapy emerged as the unequivocal choice in the post-CDK 4/6i domain in unselected subgroups. In the HER2-low population, a similar efficacy and different toxicity spectrum was seen.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (TDXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate that has demonstrated impressive activity in randomized controlled clinical trials in the context of patients with HER2-amplified and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to review the activity and adverse event profile of TDXd in heavily pretreated breast cancer patients in real practice. We describe a single-center retrospective case series of metastatic breast cancer patients who were treated with TDXd. The outcomes of interest were the overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and grade 4-5 adverse events. Objective responses and PFS were assessed in accordance with RECIST 1.1 criteria. We identified 38 patients treated with TDXd. Of these, 15 patients had classically defined HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer, 4 of whom had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. A total of 23 patients had HER2-low breast cancer, 2 of whom had active CNS disease. Of the 33 patients evaluable for response, 21 (63%) patients had a response to treatment, including three (9%) complete responses. Outcomes were similar between patients with a HER2+ and HER2-low status, as well as in patients with or without CNS metastases. No patients experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicities, and four of thirty-eight patients (10.5%) experienced pneumonitis (two patients with grade 3 pneumonitis, one patient with grade 2 and one patient with grade 1), resulting in TDXd discontinuation for three patients (with steroid administration in two patients). TDXd demonstrates impressive activity with manageable adverse event profiles in this heavily pretreated population that includes patients with active CNS metastases.",

Recent results demonstrated high intracranial efficacy with Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd). However, a real-world evidence is lacking in literature. We conducted a multicenter, observational, retrospective real-world analysis on 39 cases collected at 12 Italian Oncological Units. Patients with brain metastases (BMs) from HER2\u2009+\u2009BC treated with T-DXd in various treatment lines were enrolled. Primary endpoint was the intracranial overall response rate (iORR). Secondary endpoints were intra- and global progression free survival (iPFS - gPFS); other secondary objectives were the intracranial disease control rate (iDCR), duration of response (iDoR), clinical benefit rate at 6 and 12 months (iCBr), overall survival, and safety. iORR was 59%, iPFS was 15.6 months, gPFS was 11.8 months. iDCR was 94.9%, iDoR was 11.9 months, and iCBr at 6 and 12 months were 69.2% and 59%, respectively.

Given the increasing utilization of T-DXd, we sought to determine how HER2 status might change following T-DXd therapy. We retrospectively reviewed patients with MBC who received T-DXd at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. We included patients with paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies assessed for HER2 status using IHC. We included 41 patients with MBC who received treatment with T-DXd and had paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies assessed for HER2 status using IHC. HER2 loss was observed in 11 patients [32.4% of 34 patients with pre-treatment HER2 expression (1+, 2+, or 3+)] following treatment with T-DXd. In addition to the 11 patients with HER2 loss, another 10 patients (29.4%) had a decrease in HER2 score after treatment with T-DXd. HER2 loss and decrease in HER2 expression are common in patients with MBC receiving treatment with T-DXd. Reevaluation of HER2 status following T-DXd treatment should be considered prior to alternate HER2-targeted therapies that require HER2 overexpression for efficacy.",

It is currently unknown if specific monitoring is beneficial in the early detection of ILD in these patients. We describe the efficacy and feasibility of a novel ILD monitoring protocol in breast cancer patients treated with T-DXd at our institution. An ILD monitoring protocol developed at our institution included baseline and ongoing monitoring with pulmonary function testing (PFTs) and high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) at pre-specified intervals. Patients with metastatic HER2+ or HER2-low breast cancer treated at Huntsman Cancer Institute who received \u2265 1 cycle of T-DXd between 2020 and 2023 were included (n\u2009=\u200968). Patient outcomes and provider adherence to the protocol were retrospectively evaluated. Providers were classified as \"no adherence\" if they did not elect to participate in any elements of the recommended protocol or as \"some adherence\" if they had at least some monitoring per protocol. 10 cases of ILD were identified with an incidence of 12% (3/25) in the no adherence group and 16% (7/43) in the some adherence group. ILD cases in the no adherence group included one grade 2 and two grade 5 cases. The some adherence group included three grade 1 and four grade 2 cases. An ILD monitoring protocol consisting of baseline PFTs and ongoing monitoring with PFTs and HRCT is a feasible approach as evidenced by a majority provider adherence rate. This type of protocol may be effective in preventing severe cases of ILD and identifying grade 1 events that may permit treatment re-challenge.",

    "abstract": "Background Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is a highly aggressive subtype characterized by a high recurrence rate. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2, has shown improved outcomes; however, its effectiveness in cases with brain metastases remains unclear. The T-DM1 biosimilar has emerged as a cost-effective treatment option. Objectives The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of the T-DM1 biosimilar by evaluating progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary objective focused on analyzing the safety profile, including the incidence and characteristics of adverse events (AEs) during T-DM1 treatment. Materials and methods In this retrospective, single-center study, 30 HER2-positive breast cancer patients were treated with T-DM1 at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg, administered intravenously every 21 days. The primary outcomes measured were PFS, OS, time to treatment failure (TTF), complete response (CR), and partial response (PR). The secondary endpoint was the documentation of AEs. Results All patients, with a median age of 57 years, received prior HER2-targeted therapy, and five (16.6%) patients had undergone brain radiotherapy. CR was achieved in 20 (66.6%) patients, while 10 (33.3%) patients attained PR. PFS, OS, and TTF were approximately 14, 24, and 13 months, respectively. Common adverse events included elevated transaminases, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, the majority of which were controllable and reversible. Conclusion This study provides important insights into the efficacy and safety of the T-DM1 biosimilar. The findings indicate that T-DM1 is effective in enhancing OS and managing advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, including selective patients with brain metastases.

    "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are novel immunotherapeutic agents that have been approved for first-line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, which have completed phase 3 clinical trials, as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed to extract eligible literature up to October 2023. Findings included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted based on PD-L1 expression levels and histological type. We analyzed 29 studies including 18,885 patients. In analyses of all patients, penpulimab plus chemotherapy led the way for OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40-0.75) and PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.27-0.67). Regarding OS, for patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550%, 1%-49% and <1%, camrelizumab + chemotherapy (HR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.21-1.11), cemiplimab + chemotherapy (HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.32-0.79) and nivolumab + ipilimumab (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51-0.81) were considered optimal treatments. Compared with chemotherapy, monotherapy with nivolumab, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab had lower odds of TRAE grade \u22653. In all patients, penpulimab plus chemotherapy was the most effective therapy, but treatment preferences varied by PD-L1 expression, histology type and associated outcomes. Safety at the individual patient level must be a high priority in the decision-making process. Further validation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "[ 64 Cu]Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab represents a novel immunopositron emission tomography (immunoPET) agent with emerging diagnostic applications in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-expressing breast cancer (BC). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the current diagnostic utilities of [ 64 Cu]Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET/computed tomography (CT) and explores tumor uptake metrics in HER2-positive BC lesions. A systematic literature search of PubMed , Scopus , and Ovid databases was conducted using relevant keywords to identify eligible studies. Of the 123 articles reviewed, six met the inclusion criteria. Qualitative data analysis was applied to all included studies. Several promising utilities were identified, including [ 64 Cu]Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab's capacity to detect HER2-positive primary BC lesions, lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Additionally, [ 64 Cu]Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET/CT demonstrated potential in predicting therapy response in HER2-positive lesions. The overall lesion detectability was 91% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81-98%] for HER2-positive BC. HER2-positive BC lesions exhibited significantly higher maximum standardized uptake values compared to HER2-negative lesions, with a weighted mean difference of 2.14 (95% CI, 0.18-4.09; P \u2005=\u20050.03). These findings underscore the need for further large-scale and prospective investigations of this promising radiotracer in the near future.",

    "title": "CD36 enrichment in HER2-positive mesenchymal stem cells drives therapy refractoriness in breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Growing evidence shows that the reprogramming of fatty acid (FA) metabolism plays a key role in HER2-positive (HER2\u2009+) breast cancer (BC) aggressiveness, therapy resistance and cancer stemness. In particular, HER2\u2009+\u2009BC has been defined as a \"lipogenic disease\" due to the functional and bi-directional crosstalk occurring between HER2-mediated oncogenic signaling and FA biosynthesis via FA synthase activity. In this context, the functional role exerted by the reprogramming of CD36-mediated FA uptake in HER2\u2009+\u2009BC poor prognosis and therapy resistance remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether enhanced CD36 in mesenchymal HER2\u2009+\u2009cancer stem cells (CSCs) is directly involved in anti-HER2 treatment refractoriness in HER2\u2009+\u2009BC and to design future metabolism-based approaches targeting both FA reprogramming and the \"root\" of cancer. Molecular, biological and functional characterization of CD36-mediated FA uptake was investigated in HER2\u2009+\u2009BC patients, cell lines, epithelial and mesenchymal CSCs. Cell proliferation was analyzed by SRB assay upon treatment with lapatinib, CD36 inhibitor, or Wnt antagonist/agonist. Engineered cell models were generated via lentivirus infection and transient silencing. CSC-like properties and tumorigenesis of HER2\u2009+\u2009BC cells with or without CD36 depletion were examined by mammosphere forming efficiency assay, flow cytometry, cell sorting, ALDH activity assay and xenograft mouse model. FA uptake was examined by flow cytometry with FA BODIPY FL C16. Intratumor expression of CSC subsets was evaluated via multiplex immunostaining and immunolocalization analysis. Molecular data demonstrated that CD36 is significantly upmodulated on treatment in therapy resistant HER2\u2009+\u2009BC patients and its expression levels in BC cells is correlated with FA uptake. We provided evidence of a consistent enrichment of CD36 in HER2\u2009+\u2009epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like CSCs from all tested resistant cell models that mechanistically occurs via Wnt signaling pathway activation. Consistently, both in vitro and in vivo dual blockade of CD36 and HER2 increased the anti-CSC efficacy of anti-HER2 drugs favoring the transition of the therapy resistant mesenchymal CSCs into therapy-sensitive mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)-like epithelial state. In addition, expression of CD36 in intratumor HER2\u2009+\u2009mesenchymal CSCs is significantly associated with resistance to trastuzumab in HER2\u2009+\u2009BC patients. These results support the metabolo-oncogenic nature of CD36-mediated FA uptake in HER2\u2009+\u2009therapy-refractory BC. Our study provides evidence that targeting CD36 might be an effective metabolic therapeutic strategy in the treatment of this malignancy.",

Histological quantification of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumors is a widely adopted marker for predicting the efficacy of ICI treatment. However, its use in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is occasionally challenging because of the difficulty of tissue sampling. The aim of this study was to identify new predictive factors for ICI treatment in patients with MPE. A total of 22 patients with MPE were included. Initially, we surveyed several parameters of pleural effusion in relation to overall survival (OS). Next, we attempted to reflect the response to ICI treatment  The parameter analysis demonstrated that the levels of albumin and the percentage of lymphocyte were significantly correlated with OS in all patients.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are relevant models for precision medicine. However, there are no collections derived from South American BC patients. Since ethnicity significantly impacts clinical outcomes, it is necessary to develop PDX models from different lineages. Our goals were to a) develop BC PDX from our population; b) characterize the expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors, basal and luminal cytokeratins, EGFR and HER2; c) identify PDX mutations; d) evaluate the response to treatments selected based on their biological and genetic features, and e) perform BC tissue cultures (BCTC) from PDX tissues and compare in vivo and ex vivo results. Surgical fragments were maintained in a culture medium and inoculated subcutaneously into untreated NSG female mice, or treated with estradiol pellets. Other fragments were fixed in formalin for diagnosis and immunohistochemistry, and a third piece was frozen at -80\u00b0C for molecular studies or whole exome-sequencing. Tumors were serially transplanted into NSG mice. Once the PDX was established, in vivo and ex vivo drug responses were evaluated. Eight PDX were established: two ER\u2009+\u2009[BC-AR685 (PR\u2009+) and BC-AR707 (PR-)], one from a triple-negative (TN) recurrence whose primary tumor was ER\u2009+\u2009(BC-AR485), one HER2\u2009+\u2009(BC-AR474) and four TN primary tumors (BC-AR553, BC-AR546, BC-AR631 and BC-AR687). BC-AR685 had higher levels of PR isoform A than isoform B and was sensitive to mifepristone, tamoxifen, and palbociclib. BC-AR707 was inhibited by tamoxifen and testosterone. BC-AR474 was inhibited by trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine. BC-AR485 was sensitive to doxorubicin and resistant to paclitaxel in vivo and ex vivo. BC-AR687 carried a PIK3CA (C420R) mutation and was sensitive to alpelisib and mTOR inhibitors. All PDX expressed AR with varying intensities. GR and AR were co-expressed in the ER\u2009+\u2009tumors and in 3 TN PDX. We report the first PDX originated from South American countries that were genetically and biologically characterized and may be used in precision medicine studies. PDX expressing AR and/or GR are powerful tools to evaluate different endocrine treatment combinations even in TN tumors.",

    "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancer (BC), which constitutes 13% to 15% of cases, shows variable response to anti-HER2 therapies. HER2 positivity, defined as protein overexpression (immunohistochemistry [IHC] score 3+) or equivocal expression (IHC 2+) with evidence of HER2 gene amplification, determines the eligibility for anti-HER2 therapy. The MammaTyper assay (Cerca Biotech GmbH) is an RT-qPCR BC subtyping platform based on the micro RNA expression of ERBB2, ESR1, PGR, and MKI67. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the MammaTyper assay in predicting the response of HER2-positive patients to therapy. A well-characterized HER2-positive BC cohort of 287 cases diagnosed at Nottingham University hospitals between 2006 and 2018 was included. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: a trastuzumab-treated group (n\u00a0= 159) and a chemotherapy-only treated group (n\u00a0= 128). Tumor clinicopathologic characteristics were matched between the 2 groups. Cases with discordant HER2 status were validated through staining of surgical excision specimens. ERBB2 micro RNA identified 251/287 (87.5%) cases as HER2-positive, 10.8% (31/287) as HER2 low and 1.7% (5/287) as HER2 negative. According to the MammaTyper assay, ERBB2-positive patients treated with anti-HER2 therapy had significantly prolonged 5-year disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.56, P\u00a0= .003 and hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.62, P\u00a0= .023, respectively). MammaTyper-defined HER2-enriched subtype showed a better response to anti-HER2 therapy compared with IHC-defined subtypes, with significant differences in both 5-year disease-free survival and BC-specific survival (P\u00a0= .01 and < .001, respectively). Patients who were ERBB2 negative did not show a survival difference between the group of patients who were treated with trastuzumab and those who were treated with chemotherapy only (P > .05). Validation analysis revealed that 11/36 ERBB2-negative cases were IHC 2+/ISH positive with very low level of gene amplification and 25 cases were false classified as HER2-positive using current protocols. Combining the MammaTyper assay with IHC to assess HER2 status improves the identification of HER2-positive patients with BC who would benefit from anti-HER2 therapy.",

    "abstract": "The approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan has prompted the subgrouping of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancers (BCs) to HER2 0 and HER2 low on the basis of immunohistochemistry, although the biological significance of these subgroups remains uncertain. This study is aimed to better understand the molecular and genetic differences among HER2- tumors stratified by quantitative levels of HER2. We analyzed the transcriptomic and genomic data from the Molecular Taxonomy of BC International Consortium (discovery cohort) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (independent validation cohort). HER2- BCs, including hormone receptor positive and triple negative, were divided into three subgroups based on ERBB2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels: minimal, moderate and enhanced. We observed significant differences in mutational and transcriptional profiles across the subgroups. Tumors with enhanced ERBB2 mRNA expression had a higher prevalence of PIK3CA mutations and increased estrogen receptor signaling, while tumors with minimal ERBB2 mRNA expression displayed higher expression of proliferation and immune-related genes. We identified a distinct subgroup of BCs characterized by a large deletion of chromosome 17q12 (17q12del) with heterozygous loss of ERBB2, very low ERBB2 mRNA and HER2 protein expression. This subgroup was also enriched for heterozygous losses of TP53 and other tumor suppressor genes. Analysis of two large real-world cohorts of patients with HER2- metastatic BC (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute cohort n\u00a0= 1063 and Memorial Sloan Kettering MetTropism cohort n\u00a0= 1018) showed that patients with 17q12del and heterozygous loss of ERBB2 had poorer overall survival (OS). We identified a biologically and clinically distinct subgroup of BCs characterized by a 17q12del with a heterozygous loss of ERBB2 and low ERBB2 mRNA and HER2 protein expression. In two large real-world cohorts of patients with HER2- metastatic BC, this subgroup was associated with poor OS, highlighting its clinical significance.",

HER2DX was analyzed in baseline biopsy tissues from 23 patients with stage III HER2-positive IBC on a phase II trial (NCT01796197) treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and paclitaxel (THP). To assess the assay's predictive accuracy for pCR in IBC, clinical-pathological features and outcomes from this IBC cohort were compared with 156 patients with stage III HER2-positive non-IBC from four different cohorts. Comparative analyses included HER2DX scores, gene signatures, and expression of individual genes between patients with IBC and non-IBC. Notable differences in clinicopathological characteristics included higher pertuzumab and chemotherapy usage and lower axillary burden in patients with IBC compared with non-IBC. In the combined cohort (n\u00a0= 179), HER2DX pCR score and pertuzumab use were significant predictors of pCR, but not IBC status. The pCR rates in patients treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy (including IBC and non-IBC) were 68.9%, 58.5%, and 16.3% in the HER2DX pCR-high, -medium, and -low groups, respectively. Comparative gene expression analysis indicated minor differences between IBC and non-IBC affecting individual HER2, immune, and proliferation genes. The HER2DX pCR score could predict pCR in stage III HER2-positive IBC following treatment with de-escalated neoadjuvant systemic therapy and in stage III HER2-positive non-IBC. Elevated pCR rates in HER2-positive IBC with high HER2DX pCR scores suggest there may be a role for treatment de-escalation in these patients and confirmatory studies are justified.",

The study included a cohort of 31 heavily pretreated female patients with HER2-mutated metastatic breast cancer who were also HER2 negative per local testing. Hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients also received fulvestrant. The overall response rate (primary endpoint) was 41.9% (90% confidence interval (CI): 26.9-58.2). Secondary endpoints of duration of response and progression-free survival were 12.6\u2009months (90% CI: 4.7 to not estimable) and 9.5\u2009months (90% CI: 5.4-13.8), respectively. No new safety signals were detected. Responses were observed across various HER2 mutations, including mutations in the tyrosine kinase and extracellular domains. The chemotherapy-free regimen of tucatinib and trastuzumab showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity with durable responses and favorable tolerability in heavily pretreated patients with HER2 mutations. These data support further investigation of HER2-targeted therapies in this patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04579380 .",

    "title": "HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Treatment and Resistance.",
    "abstract": "HER2-positive (+) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, a narrative that changed drastically with the advent and approval of trastuzumab, the first humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2. In addition to another monoclonal antibody, more classes of HER2-targeted agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates were developed in the years that followed. While these potent therapies have substantially improved the outcome of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, resistance has prevailed as a clinical challenge ever since the arrival of targeted agents. Efforts to develop new treatment regimens to treat/overcome resistance is futile without a primary understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of resistance. Resistance could be attributed to mechanisms that are either specific to the tumor epithelial cells or those that emerge through changes in the tumor microenvironment. Reactivation of the HER receptor layer due to incomplete blockade of the HER receptor layer or due to alterations in the HER receptors is one of the major mechanisms. In other instances, resistance may occur due to deregulations in key downstream signaling such as the PI3K/AKT or RAS/MEK/ERK pathways or due to the emergence of compensatory pathways such as ER, other RTKs, or metabolic pathways. Potent new targeted agents and approaches to target key actionable drivers of resistance have already been identified, many of which are in early clinical development or under preclinical evaluation. Ongoing and future translational research will continue to uncover additional therapeutic vulnerabilities, as well as new targeted agents and approaches to treat and/or overcome anti-HER2 treatment resistance.",

    "abstract": "The role of anthracyclines in the treatment of early breast cancer (EBC) is increasingly being challenged, especially in de-escalation strategies. However, owing to their immunogenic effects, anthracyclines are promising combination partners with immunotherapies. In the randomized phase 2 trial ABCSG-52 (EudraCT no. 2019-002364-27), we investigated epirubicin plus immunotherapy in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive EBC. A total of 58 patients were randomized 1:1 to two cycles of a chemotherapy-free induction phase (part 1) of dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (TP) plus the anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody atezolizumab (TP-A) or TP alone. Thereafter, all patients received four cycles of TP-A in combination with epirubicin (part 2). The primary endpoint, pathological complete response (pCR), was met in 35 patients (60.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 47.5% to 71.9%), 19 patients (65.5%) in the TP-A group and 16 patients (55.2%) in the TP group. The residual cancer burden 0/I rate and objective response rate (secondary endpoints) in all patients with evaluable data were 80.0% (n\u2009=\u200944/55; 95% CI 67.6% to 88.4%) and 89.3% (n\u2009=\u200950/56; 95% CI 78.5% to 95.0%), respectively. Grade \u22653 adverse events were reported in 17 patients (29.3%). Based on our findings, we conclude that a neoadjuvant chemotherapy de-escalation immunotherapy regimen with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, atezolizumab and epirubicin is effective and safe in patients with HER2-positive EBC.",

A three-state partitioned survival model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the local healthcare system perspective. Key effectiveness data, including progression-free survival and overall survival from the pivotal EMILIA trial, were used alongside local clinician inputs. Health state utilities (in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) were obtained from the literature and direct medical costs obtained from the public health institutions in Singapore. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on cost-effectiveness. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for T-DM1, compared to lapcap and trascap, were S$472,600 and S$495,200 per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed high ICERs, with a 50% price reduction for T-DM1 resulting in an ICER above S$200,000. At current prices, T-DM1 is unlikely to be a cost-effective use of Singapore's limited healthcare budget. These findings can help inform policymakers, alongside other considerations, on funding decisions.",

    "abstract": "Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy have a high risk of recurrence and death. The primary analysis of KATHERINE, a phase 3, open-label trial, showed that the risk of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) than with trastuzumab alone. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla after neoadjuvant systemic treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab to receive T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. Here, we report the prespecified final analysis of invasive disease-free survival and the second interim analysis of overall survival. With a median follow-up of 8.4 years, T-DM1 sustained the improvement in invasive disease-free survival over trastuzumab (unstratified hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.66). Seven-year invasive disease-free survival was 80.8% with T-DM1 and 67.1% with trastuzumab (difference, 13.7 percentage points). T-DM1 also led to a significantly lower risk of death than trastuzumab (unstratified hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87; P\u2009=\u20090.003). Seven-year overall survival was 89.1% with T-DM1 and 84.4% with trastuzumab (difference, 4.7 percentage points). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were noted in 26.1% of the patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.7% of those in the trastuzumab group. As compared with trastuzumab, T-DM1 improved overall survival with sustained improvement in invasive disease-free survival among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy.

In this updated meta-analysis, we explore the effectiveness of T-DXd in a large subset of patients with HER2-positive BC and CNS disease. A systematic search was made on September 16th, 2024, for studies investigating T-DXd in the scenario of HER2-positive BC and brain metastases (BMs) and/or leptomeningeal disease (LMD). We used random effects models for all statistical analyses. We included 18 studies with 786 HER2-positive BC patients with CNS involvement (16 studies with 750 BMs patients and three studies with 36 LMD patients). We observed high overall antitumor responses (objective response rate [ORR], 60.4\u00a0%; disease control rate [DCR], 94.4\u00a0%; and clinical benefit rate [CBR], 79.3\u00a0%) and a 12-month PFS of 64.7\u00a0% and OS of 82.7\u00a0%. Intracranial ORR, DCR, and CBR were seen in 62.2\u00a0%, 88.6\u00a0%, and 68.6\u00a0% of patients, respectively, and 67.4\u00a0% achieved intracranial PFS at 12\u00a0months. Both stable and active BMs subgroups derived similar benefit from T-DXd. Better intracranial responses were seen for 33 patients with untreated BMs compared to 56 patients with previously treated or progressing lesions (odds ratio 3.82, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 1.3-10.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). For the LMD group, T-DXd elicited intracranial ORR and CBR in 59.4\u00a0% and 94.1\u00a0% of patients, respectively. This updated meta-analysis continues to support the overall and intracranial activity of T-DXd in patients with HER2-positive BC and CNS involvement, including those with LMD.",

Consecutive operable BC patients receiving postoperative RT and trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab between January 2017 and September 2020\u00a0at seven tertiary hospitals in China were retrospectively reviewed. Cardiac examinations included echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), NT-proBNP, and cTnI at baseline before RT and during the follow-up. The cardiac event is any new-onset symptomatic heart disease or abnormality in the cardiac examination after RT. In total, 681 patients were enrolled in the analysis, of whom 567 were treated with trastuzumab-alone and 124 patients received dual anti-HER2 therapy. The median follow-up was 11 months. Multivariate analysis showed that left-sided breast cancer (HR 2.38; 95%CI 1.65-3.44, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and IMN RT (HR 1.47; 95\u00a0% CI 1.01-2.15, P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.047) are independent risk factors for ECG abnormalities. Age >50 years is an independent risk factor for developing LVDD (HR 5.16; 95%CI 1.17-22.73, P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.030).

At the current data cut off overall survival analysis, T-DXd demonstrated a substantial improvement in overall survival over T-DM1. This secondary analysis use of DESTINY-Breast03 aimed to further evaluate the treatment differences using quality-adjusted survival time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) methods. Patients' survival data was divided into three health states: time spent with grade 3-4 adverse events (TOX), time without adverse events before disease progression (TWiST), and time from disease progression to death (PROG). Mean health state duration was weighted by patients' mean utility score in each health state based on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and summed to obtain the Q-TWiST value. A threshold utility analysis was also conducted using a range of hypothetical utility scores to assess the impact on Q-TWiST values obtained. T-DXd was associated with a substantial and clinically important improvement in Q-TWiST compared to T-DM1 (mean difference = 3.80 months, 95\u202f% CI: [1.91, 5.62], nominal P-value <0.001; relative gain = 11.64\u202f%). The robustness of the results was supported by threshold utility analysis. T-DXd produced a substantial improvement in quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity when accounting for time on treatment exposure compared to T-DM1. Consequently, T-DXd is shown to improve both length and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The low incidence and poor prognosis primary trastuzumab resistance (PTR) in HER2-positive breast cancer has limited research into possible treatments. Thus, it remains unclear whether this group of patients could benefit from nontargeting HER2 antiangiogenic therapy. We collected the medical data for HER2-positive patients with PTR who received apatinib 250 mg and trastuzumab-based chemotherapy (ATBC) between March 18, 2017, and March 31, 2022. All patients had progressed on \u22652 anti-HER2 treatments, including trastuzumab and small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We evaluated tumor response and safety profiles to ATBC over a median follow-up time of 34.5 months. A total of 198 consecutively HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients were reviewed; 20 were PTR and received ATBC. The clinical benefit rate of the total cohort was 55.0%. No patient showed a complete response. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 5.7 months (95% CI 2.9-8.5) and 24.6 months (95% CI 6.9-42.4), respectively. The estimated 2-year survival rate was 46.7% (95% CI 38.4-81.6%). The most common nonhematologic adverse events were hypertension (70.0%), hand-foot skin reaction (55.0%), proteinuria (40.0%), and cardiovascular decrease of LVEF (20.0%). No new toxicities were observed. ATBC had favorable effects for PTR breast cancer patients in later line treatment. The toxicity of the triple-combination regimen was tolerable; thus, further research should focus on identifying PTR patients who could benefit from ATBC.",

    "abstract": "Sushi domain-containing protein 2 (SUSD2), a transmembrane protein containing a sushi motif, has been reported to have tumor-promoting functions in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism of SUSD2 and its function in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer have not been fully identified as yet. In this study, we explored the potential of targeting SUSD2 to overcome trastuzumab (TRZ) resistance in HER2+ breast cancer. SUSD2 expression was found to be significantly increased in HER2-overexpressing cells. Endogenous SUSD2 expression was observed in HER2+ breast cancer cells but not in estrogen receptor-positive or triple-negative breast cancer cells. We also found that SUSD2 expression was positively correlated with HER2 expression in a publicly available human primary breast cancer dataset. Although SUSD2 expression was associated with HER2, its expression levels were not affected by TRZ. Through kinase array experiments, we found that SUSD2 expression was modulated downstream of STAT3-dependent signaling in breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2. STAT3 activity was increased in EGFR+ HER2+ breast cancer cells compared to EGFR+ cells. Furthermore, we observed that SUSD2 expression was decreased by C188-9, a STAT3-specific inhibitor. Finally, we analyzed the association between patient survival and SUSD2 expression in breast cancer. Our results showed that SUSD2 expression had a negative correlation with the relapse-free survival of patients with EGFR+ HER2+ breast cancer when compared to EGFR+ breast cancer patients. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SUSD2 expression is mediated by STAT3 and imply the potential of using SUSD2 as a biomarker to stratify HER2+ breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Up to 23% of breast cancer patients recurred within a decade after trastuzumab treatment. Conversely, one trial found that patients with low HER2 expression and metastatic breast cancer had a positive response to trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd). This indicates that relying solely on HER2 as a single diagnostic marker to predict the efficacy of anti-HER2 drugs is insufficient. This study highlights the interaction between histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) and HER2 as an adjunct predictor for trastuzumab response. Furthermore, modulation of HER2 expression by HNMT may explain why those with low HER2 expression still respond to T-Dxd. We investigated the impact of HNMT protein expression on the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy in both in vivo and ex vivo models of patient-derived xenografts and cell line-derived xenografts. Our analysis included F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to assess the interaction strength between HNMT and HER2 proteins in trastuzumab-resistant and sensitive tumor tissues. Additionally, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), cleaved luciferase, and immunoprecipitation to study the interaction dynamics of HNMT and HER2. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of HNMT activity on the binding of anti-HER2 antibodies to their targets through flow cytometry. We also observed the nuclear translocation of HNMT/HER2-ICD cells using fluorescent double staining and DeltaVision microscopy. Finally, ChIP sequencing was employed to identify target genes affected by the HNMT/HER2-ICD complex. This study highlights HNMT as a potential auxiliary biomarker for diagnosing HER2\u2009+\u2009breast cancer. FRET analysis demonstrated a significant interaction between HNMT and HER2 protein in trastuzumab-sensitive tumor tissue (n\u2009=\u200950), suggesting the potential of HNMT as a predictor of treatment response. Mechanistic studies revealed that the interaction between HNMT and HER2 contributes to increased HER2 protein expression at the transcriptional level, thereby impacting the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy. Furthermore, a subset of triple-negative breast cancers characterized by HNMT overexpression was found to be sensitive to HER2 antibody-drug conjugates such as T-Dxd. These findings offer crucial insights for clinicians evaluating candidates for anti-HER2 therapy, especially for HER2-low breast cancer patients who could gain from T-Dxd treatment. Identifying HNMT expression could help clinicians pinpoint patients who would benefit from anti-HER2 therapy.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab-pertuzumab (HP) plus taxane is a current standard first-line therapy for recurrent or metastatic human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer (BC). We investigated noninferiority of eribulin to a taxane when combined with dual HER2 blockade as first-line systemic treatment for locally advanced/metastatic HER2+ BC. In the phase III EMERALD trial (target sample size, 480; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03264547/UMIN000027938), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m Between August 2017 and June 2021, 446 patients (median age, 56.0 years) were enrolled. The median PFS was 14.0 and 12.9 months in the eribulin group (n = 224) and taxane group (n = 222 [docetaxel/paclitaxel, n = 186/36]), respectively (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.19]), which confirmed the noninferiority of the study regimen. The median OS was 65.3 months in the taxane group but has not been reached in the eribulin group. Median time to QoL deterioration was numerically longer with eribulin than with taxane. Adverse event (AE) rates were similar, despite the longer duration of eribulin use. Infusion reaction, skin-related AEs, diarrhea, and edema were more common with taxane, whereas neutropenia was more common with eribulin. The results suggested that eribulin + HP is an option for first-line treatment of locally advanced/metastatic HER2+ BC.",

Three ADCs have proven benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer: trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan (SG). There are over two hundred investigational ADCs on the horizon, as pre-clinical studies work to identify novel ADC targets and structures. In this new frontier, translational efforts are underway to personalize the use of ADCs, including refining HER2 quantification and elucidating genetic, epigenetic, and post-translational mechanisms of resistance. ADCs have provided important treatment options for patients with breast cancer. As patients become eligible for more than one ADC, there is an unmet need to identify the appropriate timing and sequence of these therapies to maximize their efficacy.",

Our team's previous research has shown significant therapeutic effects of novel anti-HER2 ADCs in patients with TKIs treatment failure. Unfortunately, there is currently no data available to compare novel anti-HER2 ADCs with HP combined with chemotherapy regimens. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of novel anti-HER2 ADCs with that of the HP combined with chemotherapy regimen in patients for whom TKI treatment failed. HER2-positive MBC who used novel anti-HER2 ADCs and HP combined with a chemotherapy regimen from January 2019 to August 2023 were included, and all patients received TKIs. The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while the secondary study endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety. A total of 150 patients, of which 83 are in the novel anti-HER2 ADCs group and 67 are in the HP combined with chemotherapy. Among these novel anti-HER2 ADCs, 36 patients received treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd), and 47 patients received treatment with other new types of ADCs. The median PFS of the novel anti-HER2 ADCs group and HP combined with the chemotherapy group were 7.0 months and 8.9 months, respectively, with ORR of 51.8% and 26.9%, and CBR of 69.9% and 65.7%, respectively. In subgroup, patients receiving T-Dxd showed improvement in PFS compared to the HP combined with chemotherapy group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the novel anti-HER2 ADCs group and the HP combined with chemotherapy group were neutropenia and gastrointestinal symptoms. In HER2-positive MBC for whom TKI treatment has failed, novel anti-HER2 ADCs and the HP combined with chemotherapy regimen both showed moderate efficacy and tolerable toxicity. Novel anti-HER2 ADCs are the preferred treatment recommendation for TKI failure patients. Meanwhile, based on the results of this study, the HP combined with chemotherapy regimen may also be an option, especially for patients with low accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer subtypes are delineated by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, pivotal in treatment selection. HER2-positive tumors typically respond to targeted therapies, whereas HER2-negative tumors lack HER2 overexpression. However, a subset exhibits low HER2 expression without amplification, termed HER2 low breast cancer. Despite being distinct, its clinicopathological characteristics and therapeutic implications remain less understood. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on histologically confirmed breast cancer cases from January 2022 to December 2023. Clinicopathological data including age, tumor size, nodal involvement, and hormone receptor status were collected. Immunohistochemistry categorized tumors into luminal, triple-negative, and HER2-enriched subtypes. HER2 expression was re-evaluated, classifying tumors into HER2 low and HER2-negative based on staining intensity and amplification status. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Seventy female patients with breast cancer were included, exhibiting diverse clinicopathological features. HER2 low tumors (40%) were significantly associated with higher tumor stage (P=0.03), nodal involvement (P=0.01), and positive androgen receptor expression (P=0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed HER2 low hormone receptor-positive cases (78.6%) were associated with higher tumor stage (P=0.01) and nodal involvement (P=0.01), while HER2 low triple-negative cases (21.4%) demonstrated distinct characteristics such as higher histological grade (P=0.02). This study underscores the complexity of HER2 low breast cancer and its implications for clinical management, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment strategies. It provides insights into the clinicopathological parameters of HER2 low breast cancers, highlighting their diverse characteristics and clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed neoplasm all over the world and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Breast cancer prognosis has significantly improved in the last years due to the advent of novel therapeutic options, both in the early and in advanced stages. However, the spread of the disease to the brain, accounting for 15-30% of the metastatic diagnoses, is challenging, and its poor prognosis represents an unmet medical need, leading to deterioration of quality of life and causing morbidity and mortality. Generally, triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer subtypes more frequently spread to the brain or in the leptomeningeal space. Consequently, according to international guidelines, several systemic treatments can be offered as a first option in some subsets of patients. However, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to offer the most appropriate strategy to patients. Antibody-drug conjugates such as trastuzumab deruxtecan or sacituzumab govitecan along with small molecules have led to important achievements in the treatment of brain metastases from HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. In this narrative review, we will focus on the molecular features leading to the development of brain metastases and explore the risk and the prognostic factors involved in the development of brain metastases. Finally, we will review the major achievements in the treatment landscape of brain metastases from breast cancer and novel medical approaches.",

Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for resectable LCC; however, its efficacy is limited in advanced stages, necessitating adjuvant therapies to reduce postoperative recurrence risk. Recent advances in immunotherapy have shown promising survival benefits. Here, we present a case of LCC successfully treated with a combination of surgery and pembrolizumab. A 56-year-old male smoker, diagnosed with LCC and staged as T2N1M0 postoperatively, developed recurrent disease one month after surgery, as evidenced by enlarged left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes on chest CT. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, guided by high PD-L1 expression. However, after three cycles, chemotherapy was discontinued due to severe side effects, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was initiated. After 21 cycles, there was substantial regression of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. The patient remained progression-free after 24 cycles of treatment. This case underscores the potential of combining surgical resection with immunotherapy as an effective strategy not only for resectable LCC but also for other rare NSCLC subtypes with high PD-L1 expression.",

Patients with evaluable active BMs (defined as newly diagnosed and untreated or progressing with measurable tumor-related size after previous local therapy) from HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) and treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) included in these studies were eligible. The primary endpoint was intracranial objective response rate (ORR-IC) by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)-BM criteria. Overall, 37 patients were assessable for intracranial response assessment. BMs progressing after prior local therapy were present in 64.9% of patients. The median patient age was 49.1 years. All patients had received prior trastuzumab and the median number of prior systemic treatment lines was 3 (0-13). The pooled ORR-IC by RANO-BM criteria was 64.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 47.5% to 79.8%] with low heterogeneity observed between the studies included. The clinical benefit rate by RANO-BM was 81.1% (95% CI 64.8% to 92.0%). The median progression-free survival was 13.3 months (95% CI 8.4-22.6 months) and the median overall survival was 22.5 months (95% CI 14.9 months-not achieved) with high heterogeneity between studies and numerically longer in patients with few prior treatment lines. Quality of life remained stable throughout treatment, with no new safety concerns. This patient-level pooled analysis of DEBBRAH, TUXEDO-1, and the DFCI/Duke/MDACC cohort indicates clinically relevant intracranial activity of T-DXd in patients with active HER2-positive BC, BMs, and extensive systemic pretreatment. The results therefore support the use of T-DXd when clinically indicated irrespective of BMs.",

    "title": "Impact of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy and its discontinuation on cardiac function and mortality in patients with early-stage breast cancer: An analysis based on the Japanese Receipt Claim Database.",
    "abstract": "Standard trastuzumab therapy can reduce the risk of early recurrence of HER2-positive breast cancer. However, trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction may force the discontinuation of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. Incidentally, there are still unclear whether or not trastuzumab treatment should be continued in the setting of reduced cardiac function. We aimed to investigate the association between trastuzumab discontinuation, the development of cardiac dysfunction during trastuzumab treatment, and all-cause mortality using the JMDC as the Japanese claims database. Between 2010 and 2019, 1779 women with early-stage breast cancer underwent surgery with adjuvant trastuzumab therapy (TZ). A 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching was conducted for patients who completed or discontinued TZ. The rates of cancer therapy-related-cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT) and mortality in the TZ completion and discontinuation groups were compared. After PS matching, the TZ completion group (CMP_PSM: n\u00a0=\u00a083) and discontinuation group (INT_PSM: n\u00a0=\u00a083) were included in the study. TZ was administered for 12 and 5 months in CMP_PSM and INT_PSM, respectively. The cumulative incidence of CTR-CVT was significantly higher in CMP_PSM than INT_PSM (log-rank test, P\u00a0=\u00a0.0096). The mortality rate was significantly higher in INT_PSM than in CMP_PSM. The all-cause mortality in INT_PSM tended to increase at a constant rate after treatment, even after discontinuation. Our findings suggest that discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment worsens patient prognosis due to insufficient treatment of breast cancer rather than due to the cardiovascular toxicity of the drug.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical target in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). This review highlights the current treatment landscape, lessons learned from past clinical trials, and prospects for future treatment strategies for HER2-positive AGC. Trastuzumab had been the standard treatment for HER2-positive AGC for a decade, and subsequently, trastuzumab deruxtecan, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), emerged with an impressive response. Recently, the addition of pembrolizumab to first-line chemotherapy plus trastuzumab has become a novel standard treatment. Past clinical trials of HER2-targeted therapies, which succeeded in HER2-positive breast cancer but failed in AGC, have deepened our understanding of resistance mechanisms. Based on these results, several clinical trials of novel HER2-targeted therapies, including immunologic approaches such as CAR-T cells and vaccines, are currently ongoing. Circulating tumor DNA is also expected to be a tool for real-time biomarker analysis. Additionally, ADCs with a bystander effect have the potential to expand the scope of HER2-targeted therapies to HER2-expressing, including HER2-low AGC. Learning from past trials, further development of novel HER2-targeted therapies is underway, expanding their scope to HER2-expressing AGC. Meanwhile, selecting optimal treatment is a challenging issue in cases with HER2-low AGC overlapping with other biomarkers like CLDN18.2.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy varies significantly with hormone receptor (HR) status for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer (BC). Despite extensive research on HER2\u2009+\u2009BC, the optimal neoadjuvant strategy for HR+/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC remains inconclusive. This study aimed to identify the optimal neoadjuvant regimen for HR+/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC treatment. We conducted a systematic search for trials comparing neoadjuvant regimens for HR+/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC and a network meta-analysis. Odds ratios for pathological complete response (pCR) and hazard ratios for event-free survival (EFS) were calculated. Treatment regimens were ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. 20 trials with 2809 patients were included. In pCR analysis, three neoadjuvant regimens sequentially ranked at the top, namely those comprising T-DM1, pertuzumab with trastuzumab, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor with trastuzumab, demonstrating significantly higher pCR rates than monotherapies. In EFS analysis, pertuzumab with trastuzumab ranked the first while T-DM1 containing regimen ranked the last. Anthracycline-free regimens showed a marginally higher pCR rate than anthracycline-containing regimens, while carboplatin-containing regimens demonstrated a numerically higher pCR rate than carboplatin-free regimens. Significant heterogeneity was observed in endocrine therapy analysis, which may be caused by different strategies for incorporating endocrine therapy. In conclusion, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab stands out as the optimal neoadjuvant HER2-targeting regimen for HR+/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC Furthermore, anthracycline-free carboplatin-containing chemotherapy emerges as a promising combination treatment. Further investigation is required to clarify the role of endocrine therapy in HR+/HER2\u2009+\u2009BC to guide its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "This study was aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (pembrolizumab combination therapy) and compare it with standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy alone) as a first-line treatment for metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC from the perspective of Taiwan's third-party-payer public health-care system. We used a partitioned survival model with an estimated time horizon of 10 years. The partitioned survival model uses Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free and overall survival from the KEYNOTE-189 clinical trial. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) values were based on utility values by progression status calculated from the KEYNOTE-189 trial. This study examined costs related to treatment regimens, disease management, second-line therapy, end-of-life care, and adverse event management. Cost and utility were discounted at 3% per year. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at 3 \u00d7 Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP), equivalent to NT$2,788,290. In the base-case scenario, pembrolizumab combination therapy resulted in an expected gain of 0.89 QALYs and an incremental cost of NT$2,201,203 relative to chemotherapy alone. The ICER was NT$2,478,601/QALY. In the analysis of the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) \u2265 50% subgroup, the patients who received pembrolizumab combination therapy gained 1.12 QALYs more than those who received chemotherapy alone, and the incremental cost was NT$2,522,528. Therefore, the ICER for this subset of patients was NT$2,258,358/QALY. In conclusion, pembrolizumab combination therapy is a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The relative cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab combination therapy is greatest for patients with PD-L1 TPS \u226550%.",

    "abstract": "Most of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients will experience tumor progression with immunotherapy (IO). Preliminary data suggested an association between high plasma HGF levels and poor response to IO in advanced NSCLC. Our study aimed to evaluate further the role of the HGF/MET pathway in resistance to IO in advanced NSCLC. We included retrospectively 82 consecutive NSCLC patients from two academic hospitals. Among them, 49 patients received ICIs alone or in combination with chemotherapy (CT), while 33 patients received chemotherapy alone as the control group. We analyzed plasma HGF levels by ELISA and expression of PD-L1, MET/phospho-MET, and CD8+ T-Cell infiltration on lung tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry. We investigated the contribution of HGF/MET to IO response by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with or without pembrolizumab, with recombinant HGF, or cocultured with NSCLC patients-derived explants. Additionally, c-MET inhibitors were used to evaluate the contribution of MET activation in NSCLC-mediated immunosuppression. High HGF levels were associated with high progression rate with IO (p\u2009=\u20090.0092), but not with CT. ELISA analysis of supernatants collected from cultured NSCLC cells showed that HGF was produced by tumor cells. Furthermore, when activated PBMCs were cultured in the presence of recombinant HGF or on NSCLC monolayer, the proliferation of CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes was inhibited, even in the presence of pembrolizumab. The addition of HGF/MET inhibitors restored lymphocyte activation and induced IFN\u03b3 production. In conclusion, inhibiting the HGF/MET signaling pathway could be a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting immune checkpoints, such as PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4, have transformed the treatment of patients with lung cancers. Unprecedented rates of durable responses are achieved in an imperfectly characterized population of patients with metastatic disease. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been explored in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancers. Following a traditional paradigm, antibody therapies were first studied in the adjuvant setting, after surgery and chemotherapy. Pivotal trials supported global approvals of the PD-L1/-1 antibodies atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in this setting. Exciting observations were made when checkpoint inhibitors were moved to the preoperative window. Several signal-finding studies explored a limited number of cycles prior to surgery and reproducibly reported complete or major histopathologic responses. So far, six published phase III trials have demonstrated the superiority of combining the PD-1/-L1 antibodies nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, tislelizumab, or toripalimab with 3 to 4 courses of preoperative platinum-based chemotherapy over preoperative chemotherapy alone in terms of response rates and survival endpoints. Those patients achieving complete or major histopathologic responses experienced particularly favorable long-term outcomes. It is yet unclear whether there is true synergism between immunotherapy and chemotherapy and whether outcomes are further improved by adding postoperative checkpoint inhibition. Although these pivotal trials qualify neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy as another option in curative lung cancer treatment, there is hope that the chemotherapy backbone will be ultimately replaced by rationally selected and targeted combination partners. In this work, the current status and future avenues of neoadjuvant combination immunotherapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subgroup of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen and the human epidermal 2 receptor and also a lack of targeted therapy options. Chemotherapy has so far been the only approved treatment option, and patients with metastatic cancer have a dismal prognosis with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 14\u2009months. Identification of druggable targets for metastatic TNBC is therefore of special interest. A systematic search was performed, to review the existing evidence on targeted therapies in metastatic TNBC. A total of 37 phase 2/3 studies were identified, evaluating 29 different targeted agents. In this review, results on progression free survival (PFS) and OS are presented. In most of the studies included, no improvement was observed for neither PFS nor OS; however, a few studies did show improvement with targeted agents and have led to new treatment options in subgroups of patients. The antibody drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, demonstrated superior PFS and OS in comparison to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab and pembrolizumab is now recommended as a first-line treatment option for patients with expression a PD-L1 positive tumor. Finally, the poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors talazoparib and olaparib are recommended, as first-line treatment options in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, but an immune checkpoint inhibitor should be considered for the subset of these patients who are PD-L1 positive.",

Several factors such as antibiotic exposure, low body mass index (BMI), certain metastatic location or poor performance status may influence outcomes. We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis in a cohort of patients with advanced high PD-L1 expression NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab in clinical practice. We sought to evaluate clinical outcomes according to several factors. Among the 494 included patients, median age was 67.29 years, 77% were male, 54% and 38% were former or current smokers, respectively; 84% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0-1, and 48% had a BMI of <25. 32% of patients had bone metastases, 32% brain metastases and 16% liver metastases. 35% of patients had exposure to antibiotics (AB), 44% to corticosteroids and 62% to proton pump inhibitors (PPi). With a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 15.9m (95% CI 13.1 to 18.8) and 9.9m (95% CI 7.7 to 12.1), and the overall response rate (ORR) was 43%. After univariate analysis, median OS in patients with ECOG-PS 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 was 36.7m vs. 14.8m vs. 2.7m (p<0.001). Median OS in patients who received treatment with corticosteroids vs. patients without exposure was 11.4m vs. 22.3m (p<0.001). After multivariate analysis, corticosteroid exposure (HR 1.41) and ECOG-PS (HR 2.40) maintained a prognostic impact. First-line pembrolizumab outcomes in advanced high PD-L1 expression NSCLC patients could be negatively influenced by corticosteroid exposure or poor ECOG-PS.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of progesterone and estrogen receptors and low (or absent) HER2 expression. TNBC accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers. It is associated with younger age, a higher mutational burden, and an increased risk of recurrence and mortality. Standard treatment for TNBC primarily relies on cytotoxic agents, such as taxanes, anthracyclines, and platinum compounds for both early and advanced stages of the disease. Several targeted therapies, including bevacizumab and sunitinib, have failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in TNBC. The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized cancer treatment. By stimulating the immune system, ICIs induce a durable anti-tumor response across various solid tumors. TNBC is a particularly promising target for treatment with ICIs due to the higher levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), increased PD-L1 expression, and higher mutational burden, which generates tumor-specific neoantigens that activate immune cells. ICIs administered as monotherapy in advanced TNBC yields only a modest response; however, response rates significantly improve when ICIs are combined with cytotoxic agents, particularly in tumors expressing PD-L1. Pembrolizumab is approved for use in both early and advanced TNBC in combination with standard chemotherapy. However, more research is needed to identify more potent biomarkers, and to better elucidate the synergism of ICIs with other targeted agents. In this review, we explore the challenges of immunotherapy in TNBC, examining the mechanisms of tumor progression mediated by immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, and the signaling pathways involved in both primary and acquired resistance. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing clinical trials underway to investigate novel immune-targeted therapies for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options. Currently, programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have become the first choice for breast cancer immunotherapies. Despite paclitaxel being considered a cornerstone drug in breast cancer treatment, the effectiveness, safety, and optimal drug selection for its combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors remain uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis, performing a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the inception of each database through May 18, 2024. Selected trials were those that assessed the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for the treatment of TNBC. The primary endpoint assessed was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), overall response rate (ORR), and Pathological complete response (pCR). This study is registered in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42023429651. A total of 8 RCTs meeting our eligibility criteria were included, involving 4626 patients who received either Paclitaxel (Paclitaxel-placebo/chemotherapy) or a combination of durvalumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, toripalimab with paclitaxel. The pooled results demonstrated that Durvalumab combined with Paclitaxel significantly reduced the hazard ratio for OS (surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA]: 91.05%) and PFS compared with Paclitaxel alone (SUCRA: 83.52%). Additionally, Durvalumab plus Paclitaxel significantly improved the ORR compared with Paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR]: 2.30; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10-5.20). For safety outcomes, Atezolizumab plus Paclitaxel showed a favorable profile in AEs, with no significant differences observed between groups. In the pCR study, Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel was the most effective treatment option (SUCRA: 81.85%). When combined with paclitaxel, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exhibit a favorable survival benefit. The combination of Durvalumab and paclitaxel represents the optimal treatment option. In the future, attention should be paid to the TNBC subtypes and drug dosage, as these factors may help to design personalized TNBC treatment programs.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of immunotherapy for estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has not been proven. We conduct a phase 1b/2 trial to assess the efficacy of combining pembrolizumab (anti-PD1 antibody), exemestane (nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor), and leuprolide (gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) for 15 patients with premenopausal ER+/HER2- MBC who had failed one to two lines of hormone therapy (HT) without chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival rate at 8\u00a0months (i.e., 64.3%) is achieved. Moreover, 5 of the 14 evaluable subjects exhibited partial responses (overall response rate\u00a0= 35.7%). The combination of anti-PD1 antibody and anti-hormone therapy is associated with an enhanced immunoreactive microenvironment influencing treatment efficacy, as observed in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples through NanoString analysis. Post-treatment tumors are associated with increased immune response and immune cells. The findings indicate that combining HT with anti-PD1 antibody is a promising treatment strategy for patients with premenopausal ER+/HER2- MBC. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02990845).",

    "title": "Independent Validation of a HER2-Low Focused Immunohistochemistry Scoring System for Enhanced Pathologist Precision and Consistency.",
    "abstract": "For 2 decades, the American Society of Clinial Oncology-College of American Pathologists human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing criteria have included 0 and 1+ scores, but this distinction was inconsequential. Now, based on the DESTINY Breast-04 Trial (DB-04) results, for patients with metastatic breast cancer it underpins eligibility for trastuzumab-deruxtecan treatment. Discerning 0 from 1+ immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is challenging, as HER2 low is not a biologically distinct cancer subset, there are no reference standards or controls, and second-tier tests (eg, in situ hybridization) do not apply. Prior reports cast doubt on the reliability of pathologists' IHC scoring, with resulting treatment misalignments. With institutional review board approval, our group of 9 breast pathologists from 8 Australian laboratories had previously established HER2-low-focused scoring conventions, based on the American Society of Clinial Oncology-College of American Pathologists 2018 HER2 guidelines, and specifying common staining pitfalls. We reported the results of the first set of 60 breast cancers evaluated with these methods. After a 5-month washout, for the present validation study, we have compiled a second set of 64 HER2-negative invasive breast cancer core biopsies, all assessed with the Ventana 4B5 HER2 assay. We have each scored digitized images of HER2 IHC slides of the cases. Using the majority opinion as the target score, we have calculated our performance metrics. We have compared the results of our performance in set 1 and set 2 to assess the effectiveness of our approach and learning retention. The cases in this validation set included 40 (62.5%) HER2 low, 10 (17.2%) ultralow (UL), and 13 (18.8%) null cancers. Concordance was not achieved in 1 case. For distinguishing HER2 low from other cancers (UL and null combined) the mean values of our performance metrics were accuracy 89.58%, sensitivity 90.83%, specificity 87.50%, positive predictive value 95.63%, negative predictive value 83.59%, and Cohen kappa score 0.81. Comparing these results with our initial study, we have maintained our high level of performance across these parameters. Our mean kappa score is now in the excellent range for concordance. Maintaining high performance across a range of measures in 2 separate data sets validates the effectiveness of our HER2-low-focused scoring conventions. Having validated our approach, we will use these reference case sets with expert-level consensus scores for peer training and updating our national HER2 IHC external quality assurance program. In our ongoing studies, we are also assessing the performance of software algorithms to determine their suitability for the prescreening of HER2 IHC slides.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment have shown high efficacy for about 15 cancer types. However, this therapy is only effective in 20-30% of cancer patients. Thus, the precise biomarkers of ICI response are an urgent need. We conducted a prospective observational study of the prognostic potential ofseveral existing and putative biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in acohort of 85 patients with lung cancer (LC) receiving PD-1 or PD-L1 targeted ICIs. Tumor biosamples were obtained prior to ICI treatment and profiled by whole exome and RNA sequencing. The entire 403 putative biomarkers were screened, including tumor mutation burden (TMB) and number of cancer neoantigens, 131 specific HLA alleles, homozygous state of 11 HLA alleles and their superfamilies; four gene mutation biomarkers, expression of 45 immune checkpoint genes and closely related genes, and three previously published diagnostic gene signatures; for the first time, activation levels of 188 molecular pathways containing immune checkpoint genes and activation levels of 19 pathways algorithmically generated using a human interactome model centered around immune checkpoint genes. Treatment outcomes and/or progression-free survival (PFS) times were available for 61 of 85 patients with LC, including 24 patients with adenocarcinoma and 27 patients with squamous cell LC, whose samples were further analyzed. For the rest 24 patients, both treatment outcomes and PFS data could not be collected. Of these, 54 patients were treated with PD1-specific and 7 patients with PD-L1-specific ICIs. We evaluated the potential of biomarkers based on PFS and RECIST treatment response data. In our sample, 45 biomarkers were statistically significantly associated with PFS and 44 with response to treatment, of which eight were shared. Five of these (CD3G and NCAM1 gene expression levels, and levels of activation of Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, Growth hormone signaling, and Endothelin molecular pathways) were used in our signature that showed an AUC of 0.73 and HR of 0.27 (p=0.00034) on the experimental dataset. This signature was also reliable (AUC 0.76, 0.87) for the independent publicly available LC datasets GSE207422, GSE126044 annotated with ICI response data and demonstrated same survival trends on independent dataset GSE135222 annotated with PFS data. In both experimental and one independent datasets annotated with samples' histotypes, the signature worked better for lung adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell LC. The high reliability of our signature to predict response and PFS after ICI treatment was demonstrated using experimental and 3 independent datasets. Additionally, annotated molecular profiles obtained in this study were made publicly accessible.",

    "abstract": "In the DESTINY-B04 trial, patients with pretreated HER2 low metastatic breast cancer (defined as immunohistochemistry score of 1+ or 2+ and negative in situ hybridization) had significant survival improvement with Trastuzumab therapy. The goal of our study was to compare the HER2 immunohistochemistry scores of paired primary and metastatic breast cancer, with emphasis on HER2 low criteria and its implications for detailed immunohistochemistry interpretation. Using the pathology database from 2011, we identified 272 cases of primary breast cancers with paired metastases. We reviewed and performed immunohistochemistry concordance between the primary and metastases and calculated the HER2 low incidence. Compared to the primary, HER2 immunohistochemistry score in the metastases remained the same in 156/272 cases (57%) and by immunohistochemistry was: 0 (67/114 = 59%), 1+ (22/52 = 42%), 2+ (34/67 = 51%), 3+ (33/39 = 85%) and HER2 low (85/119 = 71%). The HER2 score changed from 0 to HER2 low in 46 cases (17%) and vice versa in 30 (11%). The concordance rate of HER2 immunohistochemistry scores was 57%, highest in 3+ cases, followed by HER2 low and then HER2 negative. The incidence of HER2 low was higher in the metastases by 6% compared to the primary. HER2 should be tested in all metastases and compared with the primary, due to differences in scores as seen in 28% of our cases, which may have clinical implications in the new HER2 low era.",

    "abstract": "The clinical benefits of pyrotinib plus taxanes or vinorelbine have not been studied systemically. Consequently, we conducted a prospective evaluation to assess the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib plus taxanes or vinorelbine in patients with human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients with HER2-positive MBC were included to receive pyrotinib combined with taxanes or vinorelbine in Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and adverse effects (AEs). Between December 22, 2020 and January 11, 2023, a total of 101 patients were assigned to pyrotinib plus taxanes (n = 83) and pyrotinib plus vinorelbine (n = 18) groups. As of May 24, 2023, the median PFS for all patients was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-15.7). The median PFS was significantly longer in pyrotinib plus taxanes group than in pyrotinib plus vinorelbine group (median PFS, 12.2 months [95% CI, 9.2-18.6] vs. 8.4 months [95% CI, 5.5-13.7]; P = .005). All the treatment-related side effects were tolerated. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 side effects included diarrhea (22.8%), leukopenia (19.5%), and neutropenia (18.2%). Pyrotinib plus taxanes could be an alternative or even the preferred treatment strategy for patients with HER2-positive MBC after trastuzumab and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We also suggest that pyrotinib combined with vinorelbine has a therapeutic potential. This trial was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER-2) targeted drugs are used in only HER-2 overexpressed cancers. However, only a small portion of these cancer types are HER-2 overexpressed. In this study, we aimed to upregulate HER-2 receptors in MCF-7 breast cancer and HT-29 colon cancer cell cultures, which these cells are not HER-2 upregulated in natural status. We used a 10-day non-cytotoxic lapatinib dose to upregulate HER-2 receptors. HER-2 levels of these cell lines were tested with ELISA and immunofluorescence tests before and after 10\u00a0days of lapatinib administration. After upregulation of HER-2, we administered trastuzumab, and T-DM1 to these cell lines to observe whether there is an increase in anticancer activity. We used a cell viability test to show the cytotoxicity of trastuzumab and T-DM1. Also, we used ELISA and immunofluorescence for HER-2 pathway proteins to understand the mechanism of increased anti-cancer activity. We showed that administration of lapatinib for 10\u00a0days leads to overexpression of HER-2 receptors on both MCF-7 and HT-29 cells. A significant increase in the cytotoxicity of trastuzumab or T-DM1 was observed after 10\u00a0days of lapatinib administration. We named this method the smash method, which is the volleyball term. In volleyball, the ball is raised while low and quickly hits the ground again, just like we do with the HER-2 receptor. The smash method can switch HER-2 negative or HER-2 low tumors into HER-2 overexpressed, iatrogenically. Thus, we can use her2-targeted therapies in all cancer patients instead of a small portion.",

    "abstract": "Therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer significantly impact patient outcomes, quality of life, and health care systems. While chemotherapy and trastuzumab improve survival in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, variability in clinical and biological characteristics leads to different response to therapies and outcomes. Clinical guidelines provide general recommendations, but significant uncertainty persists in identifying an optimal treatment plan for individual patients. The HER2DX genomic test informs treatment decisions for stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer by integrating biological factors and clinical factors (tumor size and nodal status). It provides three scores relevant to patient management: long-term prognosis (risk score), likelihood of achieving pathological complete response (pCR score), and ERBB2 mRNA expression (ERBB2 score). This article offers an expert overview of HER2DX, covering score interpretation, clinical applications, ongoing studies, and future directions. By analyzing the genomic profiles of HER2-positive tumors, HER2DX provides independent information regarding therapeutic responses and disease prognosis, thereby enabling physicians to navigate the increasing complexity of managing patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Key findings show that HER2DX predicts relapse-free survival and probability of pCR to a variety of neoadjuvant therapy regimens, which aids in personalizing treatment plans that could reduce over-treatment and under-treatment. The article underscores expert recommendations to help integrate HER2DX into clinical practice, aiming to enhance decision making and clinical outcomes.",

However, no direct comparison between the two exists, nor with the more recent datopotamab-deruxtecan (Dato-DXd). We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare efficacy and safety of T-DXd and SG in CT-pretreated HR+\u00a0and TN/HER2-low MBC and assess their benefit over standard CT, exploring also a comparison with Dato-DXd. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for PFS/OS. P-score was used for treatment ranking. Three RCTs (956 patients) were included in the primary analysis and 5 (1,445) in the exploratory NMA with Dato-DXd. In HR+/HER2-low, T-DXd showed no significant difference in PFS and OS when compared to SG. Similarly, in TN/HER2-low, PFS and OS did not differ significantly between the two ADCs. The P-score analysis favored T-DXd over SG in HR+/HER2-low in PFS (0.90 vs. 0.60) and OS (0.89 vs. 0.60). SG was favored over T-DXd in OS in TN/HER2-low (0.80 vs. 0.69). Similar results were obtained for HR+\u00a0MBC when including Dato-Dxd, which showed the worst performance, while T-DXd was the only ADC significantly outperforming CT in OS. The ADCs showed significantly better PFS and OS than CT in HR+/HER2-low and TN/HER2-low (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). SG had higher rates of neutropenia, diarrhea and alopecia vs. T-DXd, which showed more thrombocytopenia, fatigue and nausea. Pneumonitis and cardiotoxicity were typically T-DXd-related, and T-DXd showed more toxicity-related discontinuations. Similar efficacy with T-DXd and SG in HER2-low MBC was observed, regardless of HR status. Safety profile, local drug-approval criteria and guidelines, patients' preferences and overall quality of evidence should ultimately guide therapeutic decision-making. Dato-DXd role remains uncertain.",

The primary outcome of interest was progression-free survival (PFS). Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4. was used for the data analysis. Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 2468 advanced and metastatic TNBC were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. PFS surge with combined therapy was observed in White (HR 0.80 [0.70, 0.91], p\u2009=\u20090.0007) and Asian ethnicities (HR 0.73 [0.58, 0.93], p\u2009=\u20090.01) but not in Blacks (HR 0.72 [0.42, 1.24], p\u2009=\u20090.24). Overall, patients with distant metastasis demonstrated to derive the PFS benefit from additional immunotherapy (HR 0.87 [0.77, 0.99], p\u2009=\u20090.03); however, metastasis to individual distant site was associated with failure to achieve any treatment difference (Bone: HR 0.79 [0.41, 1.52], p\u2009=\u20090.49; Lung: HR 0.85 [0.70, 1.04], p\u2009=\u20090.11; Liver: HR 0.80 [0.64, 1.01], p\u2009=\u20090.06). While number of metastases\u2009>\u20093 also showed to impact the PFS advantage (HR 0.89 [0.69, 1.16], p\u2009=\u20090.39). While patients, regardless of prior chemotherapy, experienced a notable enhancement in PFS with ICT (Overall: HR 0.79 [0.71, 0.88], p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Yes: HR 0.87 [0.76, 1.00], p\u2009=\u20090.05; No: HR 0.67 [0.56, 0.80], p\u2009<\u20090.00001), those previously exposed to chemotherapy exhibited a significantly smaller PFS advantage compared to those without prior chemotherapy, as evidenced by a significant subgroup difference (Test for subgroup difference: P\u2009=\u20090.02, I2\u2009=\u200982.2%). Patients lacking PD-L1 expression also failed to achieve any additional benefit from immunotherapy (PD-L1-: HR 0.95 [0.81, 1.12]; p\u2009=\u20090.54; PD-L1+: HR 0.73 [0.64, 0.85], p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Age, ECOG status, and presentation with de novo metastasis/recurrent shown no impact on IT-associated PFS advantage. Patient- and treatment- related factors such as ethnicity, distant metastases, number of metastases (>\u20093), previous exposure to chemotherapy and PD-L1 expression, seem to influence or restrict the advantage in progression-free survival associated with the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy, as opposed to chemotherapy alone, in patients with advanced and metastatic TNBC. Larger studies are warranted to validate these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), we investigated tumor and immune changes during neoadjuvant treatment and their impact on residual disease (RD) biology and prognostic implications across four neoadjuvant studies of trastuzumab with or without lapatinib, and with or without chemotherapy: CALGB 40601, PAMELA, NeoALTTO, and NSABP B-41. We compared tumor and immune gene expression changes during neoadjuvant treatment and their association with event-free survival (EFS) by uni- and multivariable Cox regression models in different cohorts and timepoints: 452 RD samples at baseline including 169 with a paired RD, and biomarker changes during neoadjuvant therapy, evaluating model performance via the c-index. Analysis of 169 paired tumor samples revealed a shift in intrinsic subtype proportions from HER2-enriched at baseline (50.3%) to normal-like (49.1%) followed by luminal A (18.9%) in RD. This luminal phenotypic change was supported by decreased correlation to the HER2-enriched centroid, ERBB2, and HER2 amplicon genes and increased correlation to the luminal A centroid (Wilcoxon test P < 0.001). Additionally, RD showed relative immune activation marked by significant increases in B-cell, CD8 T-cell, and natural killer cell signatures (Wilcoxon test P < 0.05). In multivariable Cox models, intrinsic subtypes at baseline provided more prognostic information, while immune gene expression signatures provided more prognostic information in RD. Notably, the best multivariable EFS model (c-index\u00a0= 0.77) integrated the immunoglobulin G signature from RD samples (adjusted hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.67, adjusted P\u00a0= 0.002). In patients with HER2-positive EBC and RD, tumor biomarkers provide more prognostic information at baseline. In contrast, immune biomarkers perform better for EFS prognosis in RD.",

    "abstract": "Small intestinal metastasis from primary breast cancer remains a rare clinical occurrence. Despite extensive research into its clinicopathological features and treatment options, the specific pathogenesis and optimal management strategies remain incompletely understood. This case report presents a patient with breast cancer that metastasized to the small intestine. The primary breast tumor was diagnosed as classic invasive lobular carcinoma. Subsequent surgical intervention successfully addressed the intestinal obstruction and confirmed the metastatic origin of the small intestinal tumor. Interestingly, the metastatic lesions exhibited features suggestive of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. A PET-CT scan was performed to evaluate the distant metastasis status of this patient. Notably, hormonal receptor status shifted from positive to negative, while HER2 expression changed from negative to low between the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. The presence of an undiagnosed pleomorphic component in the primary tumor might explain the disease's progressive nature. In this case, systemic treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan yielded favorable therapeutic outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest that re-evaluation of receptor status in breast cancer metastases is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies. Furthermore, a combination of palliative resection of small intestinal metastases and targeted therapy for HER2-low breast cancer may potentially improve survival.",

    "abstract": "HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is characterized by the overexpression of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene, which promotes aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis. Targeting the ERBB2 pathway with single-agent therapies has shown limited efficacy due to resistance mechanisms and the complexity of gene interactions within the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to explore potential drug synergies by analyzing gene-drug interactions and combination therapies that target the ERBB2 pathway in HER2+ breast tumors. Using gene co-expression network analysis, we identified 23 metabolic pathways with significant cross-linking of gene interactions, including those involving EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K, mTOR, and others. We visualized these interactions using Cytoscape to generate individual and combined drug-gene networks, focusing on frequently used drugs such as Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Lapatinib, and Cetuximab. Individual networks highlighted the direct effects of these drugs on their target genes and neighboring genes within the ERBB2 pathway. Combined drug networks, such as those for Cetuximab with Lapatinib, Cetuximab with Erlotinib, and Erlotinib with Lapatinib, revealed potential synergies that could enhance therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously influencing multiple genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that a network-based approach to analyzing drug combinations provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of HER2+ breast cancer and offers promising strategies for overcoming drug resistance and improving treatment outcomes.",

This narrative review explores key predictive factors influencing the efficacy of ADCs, focusing on HER2-targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, as well as sacituzumab govitecan for triple-negative breast cancer. HER2 expression, TROP-2 levels, hormone receptor status, and the tumor microenvironment emerge as critical biomarkers for patient selection and therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, we discuss resistance mechanisms, such as antigen loss, impaired drug internalization, and the role of circulating tumor DNA in predicting ADC response. Finally, future perspectives on the sequential use of ADCs and potential combination therapies are highlighted, along with emerging agents targeting alternative antigens like HER3 and LIV-1. Overall, identifying predictive biomarkers and overcoming resistance mechanisms are essential for optimizing the use of ADCs in metastatic breast cancer, thereby improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Among them, human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is more malignant. Fortunately, many anti-HER2 drugs are currently used in clinical treatments to increase patient survival. However, some HER2+ patients (~15%) still develop drug resistance after receiving trastuzumab treatment, leading to treatment failure. Using CCLE and METABRIC database analyses, we found that fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) mRNA was highly detected in tumors from HER2+ breast cancer patients (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and was associated with poorer survival in breast cancer patients. Through retrospective immunohistochemical staining analysis, we detected higher expression of FGFR4 protein in breast cancer tissues collected from patients who were resistant to trastuzumab therapy compared with breast cancer patients who responded to treatment. An FGFR4 inhibitor (FGF401) effectively inhibits tumor growth in trastuzumab-insensitive patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor-bearing mice. For molecular mechanism studies, we demonstrated that HER2/FGFR4 protein complexes were detected on the cell membrane of the tumor tissues in these trastuzumab-insensitive PDX tumor tissues. After trastuzumab treatment in these drug-resistant breast cancer cells, FGFR4 translocates and enters the nucleus. However, trastuzumab-induced nuclear translocation of FGFR4/HER2-intracellular domain protein complex in trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells is blocked by FGF401 treatment. We believe that FGFR4 overexpression and complex formation with HER2 can serve as molecular markers to assist clinicians in identifying trastuzumab-resistant tumors. Our results suggest that FGF401 combined with trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer may be a potential new treatment strategy.",

    "title": "Complete Remissions of HER2-Positive Trastuzumab-Resistant Xenografts Using a Potent [225Ac]Ac-Labeled Anti-HER2 Antibody-Drug Radioconjugate.",
    "abstract": "There is overwhelming interest to use actinium-225 ([225Ac]Ac) to develop targeted \u03b1 therapies. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are highly cytotoxic. Combining [225Ac]Ac with an ADC to develop an antibody-drug radioconjugate [225Ac]Ac-macropa-trastuzumab(T)-PEG6-emtansine (DM1), is expected to be more effective than its ADC (T-PEG6-DM1) against breast cancer. [89Zr]Zr-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl desferrioxamine (DFO)-T-PEG6-DM1 (imaging) and [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 (radiotherapy) were developed. Biodistribution and safety evaluations of [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 were carried out in non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. MicroPET imaging and biodistribution were done using [89Zr]Zr-DFO-T-PEG6-DM1, and radiotherapy using [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 was carried out in athymic BALB/c nude mice bearing trastuzumab-resistant HCC1954 and trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1)/trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 tumor-bearing mice. After 7 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 was stable in both human serum (89.2% \u00b1 0.9%) and PBS (82.8% \u00b1 0.4%). T-PEG6-DM1 (8 mg/kg) and [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 (3 \u00d7 18 kBq) administered separately in non-tumor-bearing mice 10 days apart were well tolerated biochemically and hematologically. Imaging and biodistribution showed high tumor uptake of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-T-PEG6-DM1 in tumor-bearing mice at 120 hours after injection: 38.1% \u00b1 2.8% IA/g (HCC1954) and 14.6% \u00b1 1% IA/g (JIMT-1). In HCC1954 tumor-bearing mice, all treatment groups had complete remission (8/8), indicative of the responsiveness of the xenograft to T-DM1-based treatments, whereas for JIMT-1 xenografts (having 1/8 complete remission) at 23 days after treatment, tumor volumes were 332.1 \u00b1 77.5 vs. 244.6 \u00b1 63 vs. 417.9 \u00b1 62.1 vs. 102.4 \u00b1 18.5 for the saline (negative control), T-DM1 (positive control), T-PEG6-DM1, and [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1, respectively. [225Ac]Ac-macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 is more potent than ADC against trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer and necessitates clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies to engage anti-tumor innate immunity are still underdeveloped. Imprime PGG (imprime), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), through pattern recognition receptors, successfully illicit a broad-based innate immune response in preclinical models against various cancers. We aimed to study safety and efficacy of imprime in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We conducted an investigator-initiated, multi-institutional, single-arm, phase Ib/II trial in previously treated, advanced stage NSCLC patients. Primary endpoints were maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of imprime for the phase Ib, and progression-free survival (PFS) for the phase II study (NCT03003468). All 33 eligible patients were included in the safety analysis. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed and the imprime dose of 4 mg/kg was determined as the MTD. Thirty patients treated at the MTD (phase Ib, 6; phase II, 24) were included in the efficacy analysis. Median length of follow-up was 10.8 months. Confirmed objective response rate was 10% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2-27%], with one complete and two partial responses. Median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.4-7.0), and 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 37% and 17%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 11.1 months, and 6- and 12-month OS rates were 75% and 46%. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the impact of age, sex, race, disease-stage, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, and prior immunotherapy on PFS and OS. Of these, prior immunotherapy negatively influenced OS [hazard ratio (HR): 2.95, 95% CI: 1.21-7.24]. Overall, the combination was safe and tolerable. The combination of imprime and pembrolizumab is tolerable but did not improve the outcome of advanced stage NSCLC patients who previously progressed on anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 immunotherapies. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of therapeutic PAMPs to mount a strong innate immune response against cancer.",

This was a retrospective cohort study that included 255 HER2-positive breast cancer patients who received adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of HER2-positive breast cancer and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy; disease stage I-III; <70 years; and a baseline echocardiogram showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 55%. The Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model were used. In all, 15.3% (39/255) of patients presented with cardiotoxicity. Treatment was suspended in 92.3% (36/39) of patients who presented with cardiotoxicity during trastuzumab treatment. The treatment was suspended in 46 of 255 patients and it was permanently interrupted in 84.8% (33/46) of these patients, with 84.8% (28/33) due to cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity was not associated with disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI = 0.79-2.78) or overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.68; 95%CI= 0.83-3.41).

    "abstract": "Adenosine metabolism in the breast cancer microenvironment is critical for tumor immunity. However, the prognostic significance of adenosine in breast cancer remains unclear. We aimed to dynamically monitor serum adenosine levels in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and to explore its predictive significance in trastuzumab therapy. The sequencing and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and GSE176078. Adenosine-related differentially expressed genes was analyzed by \"DESeq2\" package. Multivariate Cox and lasso-penalized Cox regressions were used to construct prognostic risk signatures. The risk scores were calculated from the identified expression of the hub genes. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using R with related packages. We also enrolled the metastatic breast cancer patients with HER2-positive from in our center and classified them into different groups according to the clinical outcomes assessed by enhanced CT. The adenosine levels were dynamically detected, and the difference in immune microenvironment between the subgroups was assessed by the immune cells that were recorded in our center. A total of 109 breast cancer patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled, and the expressions of 22 adenosine-related genes were filtered and matched from the TCGA database. The survival model based on the 15 differentially expressed genes was established, and the risk scores of each patient were the prognostic risk factors. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing data identified transcriptomic differences in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. We also confirmed the predictive value of serum adenosine in the clinical progression of HER2-positive MBC patients. The different immune microenvironment between the subgroups supported the reliability of the predictive ability of adenosine in HER2-positive MBC patients. The dynamic change of adenosine is a predictive biomarker for monitoring disease progression. The adenosine metabolism-based signature has the potential application in the prognosis of HER2-positive MBC patients.",

    "abstract": "Since 2020, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has been used in France for patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive or HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and potential toxicities among patients receiving T-DXd for HER2-positive and HER2-low mBC. Using the French National Health Data System (SNDS), we identified patients who initiated T-DXd for mBC from 30 September 2020 to 30 September 2023. Follow-up data were available through 31 December 2023. Patients were categorized into three groups according to HER2 expression and line of treatment: HER2-positive mBC receiving T-DXd in the third (HER2+ 3L) or second line (HER2+ 2L) and HER2-low mBC receiving T-DXd in the second line (HER2-low2L). We describe their characteristics and report the Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS) and incidence of hospitalization. The cohort comprised 5890 patients, including 2010 (34.1%) HER2+ 3L, 1260 (21.4%) HER2+ 2L, and 2620 (44.5%) HER2-low2L. For the three respective groups, the median age at inclusion was 59 years [interquartile range (IQR) 51-69 years], 59 years (50-68 years), and 61 years (52-70 years); 34.8%, 30.2%, and 16.0% had brain metastases; 14.2%, 13.7%, and 13.4% had a current or history of cardiovascular disease. Median OS was 30.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 28.1-33.5 months] for HER2+ 3L patients, was not reached for HER2+ 2L patients, and was 16.8 months (95% CI 14.5 months-not reached) for HER2-low2L patients. The incidence of hospitalization for cardiac, respiratory, digestive, and hematological disorders was similar for HER2-positive patients treated in the second or third line, whereas HER2-low patients had higher incidence rates for these events. In this large French observational study, T-DXd users were older, had more comorbidities, and had more brain metastases than patients included in registration trials. The rapid expansion of clinical indications of T-DXd calls for proactive surveillance and timely management of potentially life-threatening T-DXd-related toxicity.",

Trastuzumab, the first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, serves as the standard first-line treatment for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, as recommended by multiple clinical guidelines.Currently, accumulated clinical evidence reveals a considerable degree of variability in the response of HER2+ breast cancer to trastuzumab treatment. Specifically, over 50% of patients either do not respond to or develop resistance against trastuzumab.The specific mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab are currently unclear.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used to treat cancer patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a high expression level of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) could benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. However, treating NSCLC patients with PD-L1 negative is still a clinical challenge. The utilization of new-type tumor markers as predictive indicators of therapeutic efficacy, with the aim of guiding clinical medication strategies, has emerged as a paramount focus of clinical investigation and interest. We reported a 72-year-old male with cough diagnosed as poorly differentiated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (cT3N2M1, stage IV). He tested negative for driver gene mutations, and PD-L1 negative (\uff1c1%), but a high tumor mutational burden (30.9 and 39.1 mutations/Mb in the lung tissue and blood, respectively), and positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The patient received pembrolizumab monotherapy. After 8 treatment cycles over 5 months, repeat examinations showed significantly reduced lung mass and circulating tumor DNA abundance. The patient reached clinical complete remission and had long-term survival with no significant adverse events. A comprehensive evaluation of multiple tumor biomarkers should be considered in NSCLC patients. Pembrolizumab monotherapy could benefit NSCLC patients with negative driver genes, PD-L1 negative, a high tumor mutational burden, and positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.",

Thus, the concomitant use of docetaxel with drugs that inhibit or induce these transporters or CYP3A4 requires careful attention. A 58-year-old woman was receiving clarithromycin (400 mg twice daily), rifampicin (450 mg once daily) and ethambutol (500 mg once daily) for nontuberculous mycobacteriosis. The patient was diagnosed as having stage IV HER2-positive breast cancer, which was treated with a regimen of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg), pertuzumab (first dose: 840 mg; second dose onward: 420 mg) and docetaxel (75 mg/m",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and adjuvant pembrolizumab have been established as the optimal systemic therapies for patients with early stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, their efficacy and feasibility in the Japanese population remain unexplored. This study included patients with early stage TNBC or low estrogen receptor (ER) positivity (1-9%) with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2- (HER2-) negative breast cancer who received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy from October 2022 at Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. Information regarding clinicopathological features, systemic therapy, treatment outcomes, and adverse events of patients who underwent surgery by February 2024 was retrospectively collected. Overall, 69 patients received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy, and 46 underwent surgery by February 2024. The median age of the patients was 53.5\u00a0years, and 80.4% and 19.6% had stage II and III disease, respectively. TNBC and ER-low HER2-negative breast cancer accounted for 82.6% and 17.4% cases, respectively. Overall pathological complete response rate was 56.5%, with 87.5% in patients with ER-low HER2-negative tumors. The completion rates for neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, chemotherapy, and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy were 65.2%, 56.5%, and 52.2%, respectively. Furthermore, 80.4% and 15.2% of patients experienced grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and immune-related adverse events, respectively, and 34% experienced unexpected hospitalization during neoadjuvant treatment. The efficacy and safety profiles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the Japanese population are consistent with previous reports. This regimen may have therapeutic potential against ER-low HER2-negative tumors and TNBC.",

    "abstract": "With the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of unresectable/metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low has emerged as a clinically actionable biomarker. There is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of HER2-low breast cancer patients. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the clinicopathological characteristics, the evolution of HER2-low status, and its impact on the prognosis of hormone receptor (HoR)-negative/HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. This pooled analysis included 350 metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from November 2007 to July 2022. Patients were categorized into HER2-0 and HER2-low groups based on their HER2 status. Baseline clinicopathological characteristics, evolution of HER2 status between primary and metastatic lesions, and treatment efficacy were compared between the two groups. Among the 350 mTNBC patients, 34.9% (122/350) were HER2-low and 65.1% (228/350) were HER2-0. Significant differences were observed between HER2-low and HER2-0 patients in terms of age and menopausal status. HER2-low patients were older (54  In mTNBC patients, those with HER2-low status had similar responses to platinum-based chemotherapy as HER2-0 patients. There was significant discordance in HER2 status between primary and metastatic lesions. Patients with discordant HER2 status had better responses to platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore, for patients with HER2-0 primary lesions, re-evaluation of HER2 status in metastatic lesions through biopsy may offer new treatment opportunities.",

She had recently received the third dose of the second cycle of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel) and was due to receive the next dose. Initial assessment revealed hyperglycemia with ketosis without acidosis. The patient was treated with fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion under the diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) guidelines of the hospital and was eventually transitioned to a basal-bolus insulin regimen, which was continued after discharge. Based on the temporal relationship between pembrolizumab therapy and the onset of diabetes, along with the patient's persistent insulin dependence, a diagnosis of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) was established. The patient has clinically improved, chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been discontinued, and surgical intervention is planned. This case highlights the importance of recognizing ICI-DM as a rare immune-related adverse event\u00a0in patients who receive immunotherapy with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors.",

Although several adverse events (AEs) have been reported, there remains a need for a comprehensive evaluation of its safety profile. To quantify the signals of ado-trastuzumab emtansine associated AEs, we employed the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) algorithms. Between Q1 2013 and Q4 2022, 3699 patient reports of AEs associated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine were received, including 440 cases of ado-trastuzumab emtansine-induced bleeding events. Of the 3699 patient reports, 142 significant disproportionality preferred terms (PTs) were identified. New AEs have been identified with ado-trastuzumab emtansine administration, including telangiectasia, spider nevus, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, radiation necrosis, and corneal disorders. The most common bleeding events were observed in the digestive system (27.05%), respiratory system (35.00%), and nervous system (14.55%). Hemorrhagic adverse events exhibited early failure-type characteristics. This analysis offers the most comprehensive overview of ado-trastuzumab emtansine induced hemorrhage to date, shedding new light on this severe complication. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these positive PTs can provide useful insights for further research.",

These patients may benefit from more effective and less toxic therapies. To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral (IT) delivery of conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) in combination with ERBB2-targeted therapies. This phase 1 (lead-in phase of a single-center phase 2 trial) nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, Florida). Patients were enrolled from October 2021 to October 2022. Data were analyzed in 2023 Patients with early-stage ERBB2-positive breast cancer with tumors 1 cm or larger were eligible. Treatment included IT delivery of cDC1, 6 times weekly, followed by paclitaxel, 80 mg/m2, intravenously, 12 times weekly. Trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg) and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg) were administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 cycles starting from day 1 of cDC1 injections. Two dose levels (DLs) of IT cDC1 (DL1\u2009=\u200950 million and DL2\u2009=\u2009100 million cells) were evaluated, including 6 patients in each DL. The primary outcomes were the safety and immune response, and the secondary outcomes were the antitumor efficacy as measured by breast magnetic resonance imaging and residual cancer burden at surgery following neoadjuvant therapy. Twelve ERBB2-positive patients were enrolled and received treatment (DL1\u2009=\u20096 and DL2\u2009=\u20096). Nine patients had hormone receptor-positive disease and 3 had hormone receptor-negative disease, with clinical stage I (n\u2009=\u20095), II (n\u2009=\u20094), and III (n\u2009=\u20093). The most frequently observed adverse events with cDC1 were grade 1 to 2 chills (50%), fatigue (41.7%), headache (33%), and injection site reactions (33%). DL2 was associated with a diminished anti-ERBB2 CD4 T-helper 1 blood response with a concomitant increase in innate and adaptive responses within the tumor. Preimmunotherapy and postimmunotherapy breast magnetic resonance imaging results showed 9 objective responses, 6 partial responses, 3 complete responses, and 3 stable diseases. Following surgery, 7 patients had a pathologic complete response. In this nonrandomized clinical trial, the addition of IT cDC1 and trastuzumab/pertuzumab before neoadjuvant chemotherapy was well tolerated with manageable adverse effects. Based on safety and immunogenicity, DL2 was selected for the phase 2 dose. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05325632.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Surgery and radiation therapy are localized therapies for early-stage and metastatic breast cancer. The management of breast cancer is determined in large part by the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), HR (hormone receptor), ER (estrogen receptor), and PR (progesterone receptor) status. Our views of breast cancer are evolving as its molecular hallmarks are examined, which now include immunohistochemical markers (ER, PR, HER2, and proliferation marker protein Ki-67), genomic markers (BRCA1/2 and PIK3CA), and immunomarkers (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PDL1). About two-thirds of malignancies of the breast are HR-positive/HER2-negative; accordingly, endocrine-based therapy is a major treatment option for these patients. Hormonal or endocrine therapy includes selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene, tamoxifen and toremifene, selective estrogen-receptor degraders (SERDs) including elacestrant and fulvestrant, and aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. A variety of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are used to treat HR-negative breast cancer patients. These agents include taxanes (docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and paclitaxel), anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin), anti-metabolites (capecitabine, gemcitabine, fluorouracil, methotrexate), alkylating agents (carboplatin, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide), and drugs that target microtubules (eribulin, ixabepilone, ado-trastuzumab emtansine). Patients with ER-positive tumors are treated with 5-10 years of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. For patients with metastatic breast cancer, standard first-line and follow-up therapy options include targeted approaches such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and anti-PDL1 immunotherapy, depending on the tumor type and molecular profile.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in precision medicine have shifted the treatment paradigm of brain metastases (BM) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and melanoma, especially through targeted therapies focused on specific molecular drivers. These novel agents have improved outcomes by overcoming challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resistance mechanisms, enabling more effective treatment of BM. In NSCLC, therapies such as osimertinib have improved efficacy in treating EGFR-mutant BM, with emerging combinations such as amivantamab and lazertinib offering promising alternatives for patients resistant to frontline therapies. In HER2-positive breast cancer, significant advancements with tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have transformed the treatment landscape, achieving improved survival and intracranial control in patients with BM. Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), novel therapies such as sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) offer new hope for managing BM. For melanoma, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and ipilimumab has proven effective in enhancing survival for patients with BM, both in BRAF-mutant and wild-type cases. Developing targeted therapies penetrating the BBB has revolutionized\u00a0BM treatment by targeting key drivers like EGFR, ALK, HER2, and BRAF. Despite improved survival, challenges persist, particularly for patients with resistant genetic alterations. Future research should optimise combination therapies, overcome resistance, and refine treatment sequencing. Continued emphasis on personalized, biomarker-driven approaches offers the potential to further improve outcomes, even for complex cases.",

A cellular uptake assay demonstrated that FITC-labeled Tra-CM-MSN were taken up by SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, which illustrated that Tra-CM-MSN had good targeting ability compared with CM-MSN and MSN. In vivo imaging experiments demonstrated significant accumulation of FITC-labeled Tra-CM-MSN in tumor tissues, further proving that Tra-CM-MSN have superior targeting properties. Cell apoptosis experiments suggested that Tra-CM-MSN-PYR significantly inhibited the proliferation of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. The results of in vivo animal experiments also showed that Tra-CM-MSN-PYR significantly inhibited tumor growth. These results indicate that Tra-CM-MSN-PYR has potential application as a targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer in the future.",

We compared survival outcomes according to the type of adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy in patients with pCR after chemotherapy with TP. Patients who achieved pCR in both the breast and axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TP were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to assess the impact of different adjuvant therapies on RFS and DRFS. In total, 386 patients were included, with 69 (17.9%) receiving adjuvant TP and 317 (82.1%) receiving adjuvant T alone. At a median follow-up of 49 months, the 3-year RFS rate was 96.1%. There was no significant difference in the 3-year RFS between groups (94.2% in TP and 95.6% in T), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 0.37-3.55, P = .806). In the clinical node-positive group (n = 294), there was no difference in survival between groups (HR 1.64, 95% CI, 0.58-4.65, P = .35). The multivariate analysis showed no significant predictors of recurrence or distant recurrence, including clinical tumor size, nodal status, ER/PR/HER2 status, and adjuvant radiotherapy receipt. Among 11 patients with brain metastasis after pCR, there was no difference according to the type of adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy.

However, we are currently unable to depict the molecular heterogeneity of this disease with sufficient granularity. Here, by performing gene expression profiling in HER2-positive breast cancers from patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab in the ALTTO clinical trial (NCT00490139), we identify and characterize five molecular subtypes associated with the risk of distant recurrence: immune-enriched, proliferative/metabolic-enriched, mesenchymal/stroma-enriched, luminal, and ERBB2-dependent. Additionally, we validate the biological profiles of the subtypes and explore their prognostic/predictive value in external cohorts, namely the NeoALTTO trial (NCT00553358), SCAN-B (NCT02306096), I-SPY2 (NCT01042379), METABRIC and TCGA. Immune-enriched tumors present better survival outcomes, in contrast to mesenchymal/stroma-enriched and proliferative/metabolic-enriched tumors, while luminal and ERBB2-dependent tumors are characterized by low and high rates of pathological complete response, respectively. Of note, these molecular subtypes provide the rationale for treatment approaches leveraging the heterogeneous biology of HER2-positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "A previous phase 2 trial showed promising outcomes for patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer using neoadjuvant de-escalation chemotherapy with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with the standard regimen of docetaxel plus carboplatin, both with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, as neoadjuvant therapies for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. HELEN-006 was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done at six hospitals in China. We enrolled patients aged 18-70 years with untreated, histologically confirmed stage II-III invasive HER2-positive breast cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Using an interactive response system, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) under a permuted block randomisation scheme (block size of four), stratified by tumour stage, nodal status, and hormone receptor status. Patients received either intravenous nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m Between Sept 20, 2020, and March 1, 2023, 789 patients were screened for eligibility, 689 of whom were randomly assigned (343 to the nab-paclitaxel group and 346 to the docetaxel plus carboplatin group). All 689 patients were Asian women. 669 patients received at least one dose of the study treatment and were included in the full analysis set (332 in the nab-paclitaxel group and 337 in the docetaxel plus carboplatin group). Median age of the patients was 50 years (IQR 43-55). Median follow-up time was 26 months (IQR 19-32). 220 (66\u00b73% [95% CI 61\u00b72-71\u00b74]) patients in the nab-paclitaxel group had a pathological complete response, compared with 194 (57\u00b76% [52\u00b73-62\u00b79]) in the docetaxel plus carboplatin group (combined odds ratio 1\u00b754 [95% CI 1\u00b710-2\u00b714]; stratified p=0\u00b7011). 100 (30%) patients in the nab-paclitaxel group and 128 (38%) in the docetaxel plus carboplatin group had grade 3-4 adverse events. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were nausea (22 [7%] in the nab-paclitaxel group vs 76 [23%] in the docetaxel plus carboplatin group), diarrhoea (25 [8%] vs 55 [16%]), and neuropathy (43 [13%] vs eight [2%]). Serious drug-related adverse events were reported in three (1%) patients in the nab-paclitaxel group and five (2%) in the docetaxel plus carboplatin group. No treatment-related deaths were reported in either group. These findings might suggest a potential advantage of nab-paclitaxel combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab compared with the standard regimen in neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, suggesting that this new combination might establish a new standard for neoadjuvant treatment in this patient population.

Their targeted approach delivers potent anti-cancer drugs to cancer cells bearing specific surface antigens, thereby maximizing anti-cancer effects and minimizing systemic toxicity. Currently, there are three ADCs available for use in breast cancer: trastuzumab emtansine for HER2 positive breast cancer (early stage and metastatic), trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2 positive and HER2 low breast cancer (metastatic) and sacituzumab govitecan for triple negative and hormone receptor positive (HR\u2009+), HER2 negative breast cancer(metastatic). Trials have shown that these drugs have improved both progression free survival and overall survival in the metastatic setting, and trastuzumab emtansine has improved overall survival in early-stage breast cancer as well. The future of this class of compounds is very exciting. This field is rapidly evolving with new ADCs being investigated and clinical trials looking at the use of known ADCs in earlier stage disease.",

    "abstract": "Different molecular subtypes, including HER2-positive, have been identified in breast cancer. The overexpression of HER2 triggers downstream signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Until recently, trastuzumab has been used as a single HER2-targeted therapy in Egypt. However, resistance to trastuzumab has been reported. Previous studies have demonstrated the genetic variants that affect the trastuzumab response. However in Egypt, few studies investigated molecular biomarkers such as p53 that might affect the trastuzumab response. Therefore, we aimed to extend the genetics workup of Her2 + BC to include important oncogenes and other vital cancer pathways. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were collected from 24 HER2+ BC Egyptian patients, twelve patients in complete remission for 2 years or more from the start of trastuzumab and twelve resistant patients who relapsed or developed metastasis within 2 years from the start of trastuzumab. Somatic mutations in hotspot regions of 17 genes were further investigated using next-generation sequencing. Among the total number of identified variants (106 variants), PIK3CA showed the most frequent variants, with more variants occurring in the resistant group than in the responsive group (P= 0.004). The frequency of PIK3CA mutations was greater in resistant patients than in responsive patients (P= 0.036). Additionally, there was a significant correlation between PIK3CA mutations and pathological complete response (pCR) (P=0.036). Most of PIK3CA variants in resistant patients were detected in exon 9 and 20. The PIK3CA variants His1047Tyr, Glu545Lys, His701Pro, Lys111Glu, Val344Gly and Tyr1021Cys were found only in the resistant patients, suggesting that they are associated with trastuzumab resistance. PIK3CA variants were more frequent in resistant HER2+ BC patients than in responsive patients, with a significant correlation between PIK3CA mutation and a lower pCR rate. PIK3CA variants within exon 9 and 20 (such as Glu545Lys and His1047Tyr respectively) were associated with trastuzumab resistance.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the targeted therapy of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in recent years. In this context, new biomarkers enable personalized therapy management and individualized therapy monitoring. Therefore, the systemic treatment is based increasingly on the biological characteristics of the tumor disease. Given the challenges of obtaining fresh tumor tissue through biopsies, the significance of liquid biopsies for assessing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA is of growing importance for the detection of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Multiple studies have shown that the number of CTCs decreases under therapy, especially under anti-HER2-targeted therapy, and that the expression of the HER2 status on CTCs could play a role in predicting therapy response and therapeutic monitoring. The aim of this study was to analyze the HER2 status of CTCs in mBC patients before and after 3 months of systemic therapy to evaluate changes in the number of HER2-positive CTCs. The study focuses on HER2-low, which plays an increasingly important role in clinical practice due to new developments of HER2 targeting antibody-drug conjugates. In this context, temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the disease represent a major diagnostic challenge. A total of 324 patients with complete immunohistochemistry of biopsied metastases were divided into five groups: HER2 negative (-)/hormone receptor (HR) negative (-), HER2 -/HR positive (+), HER2 +/HR\u00b1, HER2-low/HR+, and HER2-low/HR-. Before and after 3 months of a new therapeutic line for mBC, CTCs were enumerated and analyzed for HER2 expression using the CellSearch\u00ae system. Overall survival of all subgroups was calculated. The analyses revealed a discrepancy between the HER2 status of CTCs and corresponding tumor tissues in 98 patients (30.2%). The number of CTCs in general and the number of HER2+ CTCs decreased during systemic treatment, mainly in HER2+ tumors, but also in the other subgroups. Discrepancy in the HER2 status of the metastases and of CTCs was observed in approximately one-third of patients. Measuring HER2 on CTCs could potentially offer a means to longitudinally monitor HER2 status during therapy and simultaneously address challenges such as tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, the predictive value of HER2 on CTCs should be further investigated in clinical trials.",

Study participants were prospectively assigned to one of four arms. Patients with normal LVEF and GLS remained in Arm A. Patients whose GLS decreased by >\u200915% from baseline or to < -15% during follow up were randomized 1:1 to prophylactic carvedilol (Arm B) or no therapy (Arm C).

    "abstract": "Among the known breast cancers, the subtype with HER2 receptors-overexpressing cells is associated with a poor prognosis. The adopted monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab has improved clinical outcomes, but it is associated with drug resistance and relatively high costs. The present work adopted the peptide solid-phase synthesis method to synthesise branched poly(\u03b5-lysine) peptide dendrons with 8 branching arms integrating, at their carboxy terminal molecular root, either an arginine or the HER2 receptor-binding sequence LSYCCK or the scramble sequence CSCLYK. These dendrons were synthesised in quantities higher than 100 mg/batch and with a purity exceeding 95%. When tested with two types of breast cancer cells, the dendrons led to levels of inhibition in the HER2 receptor-overexpressing breast cancer cells (SKBR3) comparable to Trastuzumab and higher than breast cancer cells with low receptor expression (MDA-MB-231) where inhibition was more moderate. Noticeably, the presence of the amino acid sequence LSYCCK at the dendron molecular root did not appear to produce any additional inhibitory effect. This was demonstrated also when the scramble sequence CSCLYK was integrated into the dendron and by the lack of any antiproliferative effect by the control linear target sequence. The specific inhibitory effect on proliferation was finally proven by the absence of cytotoxicity and normal expression of the cell migration marker N-Cadherin. Therefore, the present study shows the potential of poly(\u03b5-lysine) dendrons as a cost-effective alternative to Trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.",

    "title": "Navigating the implementation gap for Trastuzumab's journey from health insurance to patient access: a preliminary study in a hospital in China.",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody for breast cancer, faces global accessibility challenges, primarily due to high costs. This study examines how changes in medical insurance policies and price adjustments influence Trastuzumab utilization in China, focusing on implementation challenges and their impact on drug accessibility and affordability. This retrospective study investigated Trastuzumab utilization among HER2-positive breast cancer patients at a tertiary hospital from May 2013 to December 2022 in JX, a prefecture-level city in eastern China. Patients were stratified based on their CerbB2 indicator, because those with a 2\u2009+\u2009CerbB2 status require further FISH testing to confirm Trastuzumab eligibility. We analyzed the utilization rates of both FISH test and Trastuzumab using logistic regressions, identifying factors that influence their usage. 766 patients were included. The utilization rate of Trastuzumab among patients with CerbB2 3+\u2009rose from 40.40 to 77.94% in September 2017 following the expansion of insurance coverage, and further increased to 90.41% after a price reduction in 2020. The FISH test was not covered by health insurance, and it was not available in the local hospital until Trastuzumab became available in JX city. For patients with CerbB2 2+, the proportion undergoing the FISH test increased dramatically from 8.89 to 82.08% after the price reduction in 2020. The mere inclusion into basic medical insurance, regardless of insurance types, significantly increased the utilization of Trastuzumab and the FISH test. However, rural patients in JX city are still facing financial burdens with Trastuzumab's out-of-pocket cost accounting for 62.9% of their annual disposable income in 2020. Our findings indicate that insurance coverage and price reduction significantly increased Trastuzumab utilization. However, failure to improve the accessibility of the FISH test can pose challenges in enhancing the uptake of Trastuzumab among eligible patients. With the expiration of Trastuzumab's patent and the development of affordable biosimilars, there are now greater opportunities to enhance treatment access globally. These insights can inform policy makers of implementation guidance about providing financial support for breast cancer patients in other LMICs.",

Accurate individual prognosis is essential for determining appropriate adjuvant treatment and early intervention. This study aims to enhance relapse and metastasis prediction using an innovative framework with machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) techniques. The developed framework is analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, which has 123 HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Our two-stage experimental approach first applied six basic ML models (support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting) and then ensembled these models using weighted averaging, soft voting, and hard voting techniques. The weighted averaging ensemble approach achieved enhanced performances of 88.46% accuracy, 89.74% precision, 94.59% sensitivity, 73.33% specificity, 92.11% F-Value, 71.07% Mathew's correlation coefficient, and an AUC of 0.903. This framework enables the accurate prediction of relapse and metastasis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients using H&E images and clinical data, thereby assisting in better treatment decision-making.",

We report a phase II clinical trial of atezolizumab following PD-1 directed therapy (NCT03014648). Previously treated advanced NSCLC patients were enrolled in cohorts based on response to prior nivolumab or pembrolizumab therapy; progressive disease (Cohort 1); stable disease (Cohort 2), or partial or complete response (Cohort 3). Atezolizumab was administered 1200mg IV every three weeks. The primary endpoint was best overall response by RECIST v1.1. Within each cohort, a stopping rule for futility was implemented using Simon\u2019s optimal two-stage design if none of the first eleven evaluable patients within a cohort had an objective response. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and treated with atezolizumab, 24 of whom had subsequent radiographic imaging. In Cohort 1, two of 17 patients achieved a PR (11.8%; 95% CI 1.5\u201336.4%) lasting 9 months and 3 months. While Cohort 1 met criteria to proceed to the second stage of the two-stage design, this and other cohorts closed prematurely due to slow accrual. One additional patient had a PR in Cohort 3 lasting 21 months. Grade \u22653 TRAEs occurred in 14.3% of patients. Durable responses were noted in patients with PD-1 experienced advanced NSCLC. A response rate of about 10% suggests a benchmark against which novel immunotherapy combinations should be measured in immunotherapy experienced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Current standard of care for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is first-line treatment with chemotherapy in combination with the HER2-targeting monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. While this treatment approach is associated with improved clinical outcomes, there is a treatment burden associated with the invasive and time-consuming nature of separate intravenous (IV) administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab. In 2020, a novel subcutaneous (SC) formulation of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab with recombinant human hyaluronidase, available as a fixed-dose combination vial that can be administered in 5-8 minutes, was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. A UK cancer centre set out to switch all patients currently receiving IV infusion of pertuzumab and trastuzumab over to the combined SC injection in a safe and timely manner and to initiate all future patients on the combined SC injection. Organisational governance approval was obtained before a novel project model approach was used to implement the treatment switch which incorporated aspects such as education and multidisciplinary team collaboration. Of the 97 eligible patients, 99% were switched to the combined SC injection safely and effectively over a 4-week period. Between 1st April 2021 and 30th September 2022, 3062 hours of pharmacy aseptic preparation time and 6764 hours of day unit chair time were saved. The number of aseptic unit operation days above the maximum capacity was reduced post-switch. This initiative demonstrated the ability to rapidly and effectively transition >95% of eligible breast cancer patients from separate IV trastuzumab and pertuzumab to a fixed combined SC formulation. Patient benefits included shorter administration appointments and a less invasive form of treatment, whereas healthcare system benefits included substantial savings in aseptic preparation time and chair time, and a meaningful increase in clinic capacity. The reported treatment-switch process provides a model that can be adopted by other centres wishing to implement similar treatment switches.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females worldwide. Despite significant advancements in treatment, drug resistance remains a major challenge, limiting the effectiveness of therapies and leading to dismal outcomes. Approximately 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients develop resistance to trastuzumab, and patients with triple-negative breast cancer often experience resistance to first-line therapies. The drug resistance mechanisms involve altered drug uptake, enhanced DNA repair, and dysregulated apoptosis pathways. MicroRNAs are essential in regulating cellular processes involved in both homeostasis and disease. Recent data suggest that microRNAs can overcome drug resistance by regulating the pathways that confer drug resistance. Combining different conventional anticancer agents with microRNA therapies holds promise for enhancing treatment effectiveness against drug resistant breast cancer. Advancements in nano-drug delivery systems have facilitated the effective delivery of microRNAs by improving their stability, targeting specific cells, and enhancing cellular uptake. This review elucidates the recent advancements in microRNA-based therapies, their effects on gene expression, and their clinical efficacy in overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer.",

Treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with anti-HER2-monoclonal antibodies, specifically trastuzumab and pertuzumab, is considered standard of care in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings and in the first-line setting for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are commonly administered intravenously. Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of trastuzumab alone and as a combined product of pertuzumab and trastuzumab are now available for clinical use. Phase III trial results demonstrate that the efficacy and safety of SC trastuzumab and fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf for subcutaneous (PH FDC SC) injection and the intravenous (IV) formulation counterparts are comparable. SC formulations of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies offer several advantages over IV counterparts, including shorter administration time, less need for IV access, and better resource utilization for treatment facilities. This review summarizes the clinical data supporting the use of SC trastuzumab and PH FDC SC injection in treating early-stage and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and highlights the benefits of SC injection compared to the IV formulations.",

This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the baseline SII in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients receiving chemotherapy plus trastuzumab without or with pertuzumab. Data were collected from 774 patients from the CLEOPATRA trial, 196 patients from the H0648G trial, and 229 patients from six clinical centers in China. Patients were divided into the low and high SII subgroups according to the median SII value. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was used to control bias. Associations between the SII and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. In the CLEOPATRA trial, a lower SII was associated with better PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.65, P = 0.02) and OS (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.88, P = 0.02) in the trastuzumab and docetaxel groups, as well as improved PFS in the trastuzumab and pertuzumab and docetaxel groups (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.77, P < 0.01) after IPTW. In the H0648G trial, a lower SII was associated with better PFS (P = 0.04) and OS (P = 0.02) in HER2-positive MBC patients receiving trastuzumab-based therapy. According to real-world data, a lower SII predicted an improvement in PFS for patients treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab without or with pertuzumab (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). A low baseline SII is associated with better survival outcomes among HER2-positive MBC patients receiving trastuzumab-based first-line therapy.",

    "abstract": "Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has demonstrated substantial antitumor activity and durable responses in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. We report here the treatment outcomes of T-DXd in a patient with HER2+ breast cancer with brain metastases that repeatedly recurred and progressed after two lines of salvage therapy. In 2016, a 23-year-old G0P0 female with risk factors including menarche at age 9 years, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and a strong family history of cancer was diagnosed with bilateral, triple-positive breast cancer. She received chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapies, total mastectomy, and locoregional radiotherapy, but a brain metastasis in the left parieto-occipital lobe was detected in 2020. After receiving capecitabine, lapatinib, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, and tamoxifen, multiple new lesions appeared in the brain after 14 months. The patient then received capecitabine, neratinib, GnRH agonist, and letrozole; however, her brain metastases still progressed after 7 months. In 2022, she started T-DXd treatment. Good response to treatment was observed 4 months later, including a continuous decrease in the cancer antigen 15-3 level, a reduction in the size of the major brain tumor, and the absence of new lesions. Now aged 30, the patient is continuing to receive T-DXd treatment to prevent recurrence. We conclude that T-DXd was effective for the treatment of brain metastases in this young patient with triple-positive metastatic breast cancer who had multiple risk factors and had received several anti-HER2 therapies prior to T-DXd.",

    "abstract": "Multiple first-line treatment options have been developed for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in each subgroup determined by predictive biomarkers, specifically driver oncogene and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status. However, the methodology for optimal treatment selection in individual patients is not established. This study aimed to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based personalized survival prediction model according to treatment selection. The prediction model was built based on random survival forest (RSF) algorithm using patient characteristics, anticancer treatment histories, and radiomics features of the primary tumor. The predictive accuracy was validated with external test data and compared with that of cox proportional hazard (CPH) model. A total of 459 patients (training, n\u2009=\u2009299; test, n\u2009=\u2009160) with advanced NSCLC were enrolled. The algorithm identified following features as significant factors associated with survival: age, sex, performance status, Brinkman index, comorbidity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, histology, stage, driver oncogene status, tumor PD-L1 expression, administered anticancer agent, six markers of blood test (sodium, lactate dehydrogenase, etc.), and three radiomics features associated with tumor texture, volume, and shape. The C-index of RSF model for test data was 0.841, which was higher than that of CPH model (0.775, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, the RSF model enabled to identify poor survivor treated with pembrolizumab because of tumor PD-L1 high expression and those treated with driver oncogene targeted therapy according to driver oncogene status. The proposed AI-based algorithm accurately predicted the survival of each patient with advanced NSCLC. The AI-based methodology will contribute to personalized medicine. The trial design was retrospectively registered study performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine (approval: 2020\u2009-\u20090287).",

Nivolumab represents a significant advancement for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the absence of reliable biomarkers predicting treatment response hinders personalized therapy. Eosinophils play a notable role in cancer biology, particularly when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Eosinophils can infiltrate tumor tissues, directly interacting with tumor cells or modifying the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to assess the potential of PD-L1 expression and peripheral blood eosinophil count in predicting treatment response and patient survival. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in three major cancer centers in Turkey, including 174 advanced NSCLC patients who had progressed after chemotherapy between July 2019 and November 2023. Demographic and clinical data, PD-L1 levels, and eosinophil counts were analyzed using SPSS 27.0. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Increased peripheral blood eosinophil count was positively associated with response to Nivolumab treatment and overall survival. Among treatment responders, 54.1% had eosinophil levels between 100-499 cells/mm",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Since the appearance of molecular medicine, the perspective of breast cancer treatment has changed, making it more successful in comparison with the treatment during previous years. Numerous ongoing trials are exploring the capacity of immunotherapy, mainly in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), in conjunction with conventional therapies or with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The current narrative review discusses the advantages and limitations of immunotherapy in breast cancer treatment in conjunction with the surgical options available. Going through the modern capacity of surgery treatment and how the use of immunotherapy in conjunction with it has emerged as a transformative approach to breast cancer and listing the main complications and adverse effects caused by ICIs. We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASS. Fourteen different articles showed that the use of cytokines and cancer vaccines revealed new possibilities to treat breast cancer with antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1 (pembrolizumab), PI3K/Akt/mTOR (alpelisib and everolimus), CAR T-cell (chimeric antigen receptor), PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), and CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), and with representative relevance of changing in tumor microenvironment. Immunotherapy made it possible to reduce recurrences, after radiotherapy and surgery. Estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targets show also a high effectivity. In recent years, the release of new strategies has become promising, for changing the microenvironment and de-escalation of therapy based on tumor biology, novel biomarkers, and tumor spread.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive treatment of breast cancer includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and the means are extremely rich. In recent years, the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become one of the significant treatment drugs for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive. ADCs provides new treatment options, and it improves outcomes and quality of life for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. However, we need to pay special attention to the adverse events (AEs) caused by ADCs, such as gastrointestinal reactions, bone marrow suppression, and interstitial lung disease (ILD), etc. At present, clinicians are in the initial stage of understanding the AEs caused by ADCs, and there is no expert consensus for the treatment on the AEs caused by ADC. For example, ILD caused by ADCs. Here, we reported one case with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. The patient was treated with ADCs of ARX-788 for third-line treatment, she had ILD. After treatment of ILD, the patient was treated with ADCs of trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) for fourth-line treatment and she had ILD again. After suspension of such drugs, the patient's condition was stable without significant progress over 1 year. For such patients, how to diagnose and treat them appropriately has become a new challenge for oncologists. Whether other anti-HER2 ADCs can be tried in the later lines is still being cautious. Whether there is a certain relationship between the side effects and efficacy of ADCs, there is no evidence-based data.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab (Herceptin) can be administered intravenously (IV Herceptin) and subcutaneously, with similar efficacy and safety, but with differences in dosage and costs. Previous studies have evaluated the costs of both treatment approaches in the outpatient settings, but no study has compared the costs of IV Herceptin administered in outpatients with subcutaneous Herceptin administered at patients' homes (Homecare SC Herceptin). This study aimed to compare the per-patient costs of Homecare SC Herceptin versus IV Herceptin administered in a healthcare institution's outpatient setting in Singapore. We performed a model-based cost-minimization analysis to estimate and compare the per-patient annual costs associated with each treatment modality from a societal perspective. Direct cost comprised healthcare resources utilization: drug, consumables, manpower, facility and cardiac assessment. Indirect cost was valued using a human capital approach to account for productivity lost by patients. Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 iterations were performed to account for parameter uncertainties. Costs were reported in 2023 Singapore dollars. The annual societal cost per patient receiving IV Herceptin ranged from S$64,194 to S$65,135, while for Homecare SC Herceptin, it ranged from S$25,865 to S$26,807. Homecare SC Herceptin reduced the annual cost burden by 58.8% and 59.7%, per non-metastatic and metastatic breast cancer patient, respectively. The primary cost contributor was drug therapy, comprising more than 90% of the total cost. Even when excluding the cost of drugs, Homecare SC Herceptin remained cheaper by S$1912 annually. The cost reduction is approximately 60% compared to IV Herceptin regardless of disease status, with a 100% probability that the decision to adopt Homecare SC Herceptin leads to cost savings in Singapore. Treatment of breast cancer with Homecare SC Herceptin is a cost-saving option compared to IV Herceptin.",

    "abstract": "In 2021, breast cancer affected 75,619 women in Denmark. Approximately 50% of breast cancers are considered human epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a02 (HER2)-low. The DESTINY-Breast04 (DB-04) trial led to European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) as a treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6\u00a0months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, the Danish Breast Cancer Group guidelines recently included T-DXd as a treatment for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. This economic evaluation aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd for the approved EMA indication in Denmark. A three-state-progression-free, post-progression, and death-partitioned survival model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd versus treatment of physician's choice over a lifetime horizon following the Danish Medicines Council guidelines. Clinical data were gathered from the DB-04 trial, and cost and resource use data were sourced from the literature. Sensitivity and scenario analysis were conducted to explore uncertainty. T-DXd led to 0.78 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incurred DKK\u00a0621,325 in incremental costs compared to the treatment of physician's choice. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DKK\u00a0795,181 per QALY gained, which falls below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed the robustness of the deterministic result, with T-DXd remaining cost-effective. Our study demonstrates that T-DXd is a cost-effective treatment for patients with HER2-low unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior chemotherapy in Denmark.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to determine whether the employment of fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC; and Phesgo as brand name) to treat metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients would minimize costs compared to the traditional treatment of separate intravenous doses of pertuzumab and trastuzumab in Peru. To achieve this, we used EsSalud (the social security health insurance) data and assessed it through a mixed strategy, which consisted of a quantitative and a qualitative approach. The first one aimed to calculate the direct (non-drug consumables, drugs, and healthcare professionals) and indirect costs of both treatments to develop a comparison, whilst the second aimed to validate information and internalize the procedure in an EsSalud context. Overall, we found that the usage of PH FDC SC would be cost saving in EsSalud's context. Specifically, we found three main advantages. Firstly, PH FDC SC generates a savings of 62% in non-drug consumables, which helps alleviate the healthcare system budget constraint. Secondly, its adoption frees up 61 hours of treatment and observation time for a single patient per year, which in turn increases the attention capacity of the healthcare system in terms of nursing hours and chemotherapy couches. Thirdly, the reduction of clinic time supposes an advantage for the patient in the form of increased productivity and well-being. Hence, the adoption of this drug would improve the quality of life of patients while reducing costs and pressure on the healthcare system. This is aligned with the strategy of prioritizing the appropriate breast cancer treatment within the National Cancer Care Plan. In this regard, we also found that the savings produced from switching from the traditional intravenous treatment to the subcutaneous one would allow EsSalud to afford full annual costs of 2 additional treatments, but without increasing their budget. This would cover 7% of the gap of 29 patients who do not have access to full treatment.",

This multicenter retrospective study included NSCLC patients with a TPS score of 1-49\u00a0%, who began first-line chemotherapy. Propensity score matching analysis was used to adjust for various confounders and evaluate treatment efficacy. A total of 401 patients were enrolled, of whom 308 received ICI-chemo and 93 received I-N-based therapy. The median OS was 21.0 months in the ICI-chemo group and 20.0 months in the I-N-based therapy group.

Treatment discontinuation occurred for 26.2\u00a0% of the patients in the ICI-chemo group and 41.9\u00a0% in the I-N-based therapy group. Among PD-L1 TPS 1-49\u00a0%, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes between the ICI-chemo group and the I-N-based therapy group.

    "abstract": "The therapeutic landscape for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer has exploded in the last two decades following the initial advent of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody. While the first line treatment has remained a combination of dual HER2 blockade with taxane chemotherapy, we now have several exciting options in the second line and beyond. The introduction of antibody-drug conjugates, in specific trastuzumab deruxtecan, has resulted in the best progression-free survival among patients with this subtype of breast cancer. Given the excellent outcomes of these drugs, clinical trials are now evaluating the role of ADCs in the front-line setting in previously untreated patients. In addition, there are also clinical trials evaluating the role of other targets in patients with HER2-positive cancers, including PI3KCA mutations, PD-L1 and CDK4/6. Given the predilection for brain metastases in this population, there is enthusiasm to identify the optimal combination of effective treatments. Tucatinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab combination represent one such promising strategy. With the increasing longevity of these patients, important clinical questions include optimal treatment sequencing, the role of de-escalation of treatment in excellent responders, and the associated financial toxicity. Despite the aggressive nature of this subtype of breast cancer, the outcomes continue to improve for these patients with the evolving treatments.",

    "title": "Functional evaluation of circulating anti-cancer antibodies with a 3D tumor cell growth inhibition assay.",
    "abstract": "Antibodies directed against surface antigens of tumor cells are commonly found in sera of cancer patients and of oncological animal models. Polyclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of the same antigen may be spontaneously elicited by tumor antigens or may result from the administration of specific vaccines and other immunostimulating treatments. Furthermore, after therapeutic administration of monoclonal antibodies, the antibody will be detectable in the bloodstream for several weeks. Circulating antibodies are easily detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and other immunometric tests which, however, cannot tell whether the antibodies are functional, i.e. whether they can significantly inhibit (or enhance) tumor growth. One possibility would be to treat conventional (i.e. bi-dimensional, 2D) tumor cell cultures with antibody-containing sera. However, in several instances, it was found that 2D cultures were poorly sensitive, even to powerful monoclonal antibodies like trastuzumab, whereas three-dimensional (3D) cultures may better reveal the tumor-inhibitory activity of circulating antibodies. We describe here a breast cancer 3D soft agar colony growth inhibition assay that was developed to quantify the tumor cell inhibitory activity of antibodies against human HER-2 elicited in mice by specific vaccines. The assay might be readily modified to analyze antibodies against different surface antigens expressed by other tumor types and also for testing of new monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies.",

    "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adjuvant Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Early Breast Cancer in Japan.",
    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer presents considerable treatment challenges owing to its aggressive nature. Global guidelines have endorsed a full year of HER2-targeted therapy for early-stage breast cancer. However, previous cost-effectiveness analyses of dual HER2-targeted therapies have been limited. This study aimed to examine the cost effectiveness of dual HER2-targeted therapy for early-stage breast cancer within the Japanese healthcare system context. In the Markov model-based study, the cost effectiveness of dual anti-HER2 therapy, combining pertuzumab and trastuzumab, was assessed in comparison to trastuzumab monotherapy. Patients in whom treatment was initiated at a median age of 51 years were included. The study utilized quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as comparison units. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore variations in cost effectiveness, focusing on node-positive and node-negative patients. Both one-way deterministic and broader probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 samples were performed from the Japanese healthcare payers perspective. Dual HER2-targeted therapy led to 0.17 QALYs increment at an additional cost of $US15,289, resulting in an ICER of $US92,232 per QALY. In the subgroup of node-positive patients, the benefit of the dual HER2-targeted therapy was more pronounced, with an increase of 0.64 QALYs and an ICER of $US24,561 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed the model's susceptibility to changes in the transition probabilities from invasive disease-free survival to death, from invasive disease-free survival to first-line metastatic breast cancer, and to costs associated with pertuzumab. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that for node-positive patients, dual HER2-targeted therapy may be a cost-effective option. The economic viability of dual HER2-targeted therapy was most pronounced in patients with node-positive high-risk early breast cancer. This study highlights the potential of dual HER2-targeted therapy as a cost-effective addition for these cases.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as the absence of overexpression of HER2. Accounting for 10 to 15% of breast cancers, it remains characterized by an aggressive phenotype with an increased risk of early recurrence and overall survival less favorable compared to other subtypes. The challenges in management and therapeutic evolution are likely related to the demonstrated high biological heterogeneity of this subtype. Regarding therapeutic management, chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of TNBC treatment. In the early stage, the neoadjuvant strategy is the standard, allowing adaptation of the adjuvant sequence depending on whether a complete histological response is achieved or not. Dose-dense chemotherapy regimens and the addition of carboplatin have been associated with an improvement in these response rates. Furthermore, immunotherapy, particularly pembrolizumab, has shown significant benefits in terms of recurrence-free survival. In the metastatic setting, the role of theranostic markers is now established, allowing access to immunotherapy (pembrolizumab if CPS PD-L1>10%) or PARP inhibitors (in case of constitutional BRCA mutation). Antibody-drug conjugates are gradually moving up the lines, offering promising prospects in these complex situations. In conclusion, despite recent progress, TNBC remains a major clinical challenge. A better understanding of its biology and a personalized therapeutic approach are essential to improve clinical outcomes for patients with this aggressive form of breast cancer.",

This study aimed to analyse the current response characteristics to platinum as a second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC (PD-L1 \u226550%) after first-line immunotherapy.

All first-line treatments applied pembrolizumab (median dose: 12 cycles). Second-line platinum-based therapy achieved OS of 25 months (95% CI: 7-45 months) and progression-free survival (PFS) of 6 months (95% CI: 2.5-95 months). The ORR was 47.1% [seven patients with a partial response (PR) and one patient with a complete response (CR)]. Of the patients with PRs or CRs, 75% were treated with platinum plus pemetrexed. The one-year survival rate was 58.8%. The historical OS for first-line platinum-based doublets is 7 to 12 months, with PFS of three to five months and an ORR of 17-30%. The current response to second-line platinum-based therapies for patients with advanced NSCLC after immunotherapy appears to achieve favourable response rates and be an optimal treatment after progression to immunotherapy. Prior immunotherapy appears to enhance these patients' platinum response, though future confirmatory studies are necessary.",

    "abstract": "HER2-positivity is an essential marker for therapeutic decisions, while HER2 expression is heterogenous. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of a subgroup of breast cancer patients who have low levels of HER2 expression, also known as HER2-low because trastuzumab deruxtecan offers clinical benefit for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. Despite the growing interest in HER2-low breast cancer, there is limited research on how multigene assays can help differentiate between HER2-low and HER2-negative breast cancer. Among HR\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer, we compared genomic characteristics between HER2-low and HER2-zero using the 21-gene assay. A retrospective review of clinical records was performed in 2,295 patients who underwent Oncotype DX Of these, 944 (41.1%) patients were assigned to the HER2-zero group, while 1351 (58.9%) patients were assigned to the HER2-low group. The average Recurrence Score (RS) was found to be 17.802 in the HER2-zero breast cancer group and 18.503 in the HER2-low group, respectively (p-value\u2009<\u20090.005). When comparing the proportion of high RS between the two groups, the HER2-zero group had a high RS rate of 12.4% (117 out of 944), while the HER2-low group had a high RS rate of 17.0% (230 out of 1351) (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The HER2 score identified by qRT-PCR was 8.912 in the HER2-zero group and 9.337 in the HER2-low group (p\u2009<\u20090.005). In multivariable analysis, HER2-low status was found to be an independent factor for high RS, with an odds ratio of 1.517 (1.172-1.964), independent of ER, PR, and Ki67. Within the subgroup of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, the high RS rates were 19% in the HER2-low group and 14% in the HER2-zero group. However, when considering all patients, there were no significant differences observed in recurrence-free survival and overall survival between the HER2-low and HER2-zero groups. Within HR\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer, HER2-low tumors are associated with high RS, especially for histologically invasive ductal carcinoma. A prognostic influence of HER2-low expression among HR\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer remains as an area that requires further study.",

Infusion reactions (IR) with TRA are frequently observed in practice. Although the efficacy of premedication has been previously reported, it remains uncommon. The probability of severe IR due to TRA is low; however, when it does occur, it is associated with patient discomfort and expenditure of medical resources. This study aimed to analyze the factors associated with the occurrence of IR in patients with breast cancer who received TRA. We retrospectively studied 204 patients who underwent TRA for breast cancer treatment between September 2008 and June 2023, identifying factors influencing the occurrence of IR at the time of TRA administration. A total of 182 patients were included in this study, and the incidence of IR was 25.8% (47/182 patients). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that pertuzumab (PER) use, high alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were associated with IR. IR should be considered when PER is combined with TRA. ALP and HDL cholesterol levels may be predictive markers of TRA-induced IR in patients with breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has become the most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women globally. The prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer remains poor, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival rates. In the era of precision medicine, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have gained significant attention as a targeted therapeutic strategy in breast cancer treatment. ADCs, a relatively new treatment for breast cancer, deliver cytotoxic drugs (payloads), directly into the tumor space, turning chemotherapy into a targeted agent, which enables patients to experience significant improvements with manageable drug toxicity. For the treatment of breast cancer, there are three ADCs approved for breast cancer treatment: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) targeting HER-2, and Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) targeting Trop-2. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the benefits of ADC therapies extend beyond HER2-positive breast cancer toinclude hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and HER2-low expressing breast cancer. Notably, the DESTINY-Breast series of studies, particularly focusing on T-Dxd, encompass neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and multiple lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer. This marks the advent of a comprehensive ADC era in breast cancer treatment. This review summarizes the efficacy and adverse effects of ADC therapies that have completed or are currently undergoing phase I-III clinical trials. Additionally, it analyzes potential combination strategies to overcome ADC resistance, aiming to provide clinicians with a comprehensive clinical guide to the use of ADCs in breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The advent of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represents a landmark advance in cancer therapy, permitting targeted delivery of a potent cytotoxic agent to tumor cells with minimal damage to surrounding cells. Although ADCs can induce sustained therapeutic responses in heavily pretreated patients, they can also cause significant toxicity and thus require careful monitoring. The prototype ADC, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is comprised of a humanized, monoclonal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody, trastuzumab, linked to the cytotoxic agent, DM1, and is used for the treatment of early-stage and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Liver toxicities, including transaminitis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia resulting in portal hypertension have been described. We report a case series of four patients who developed hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) during treatment with T-DM1. HPS is characterized by hypoxemia, portal hypertension, and intrapulmonary shunting, and it can be associated with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. HPS secondary to noncirrhotic portal hypertension occurring with long-term exposure to T-DM1 has not previously been reported. Four patients who received T-DM1 in our institutional cohort (n=230) developed HPS, which can be associated with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. Each patient diagnosed with HPS received >50 doses of T-DM1. Only one patient at diagnosis had resting hypoxia, while the other three patients became hypoxic with exertion only. Discontinuation of T-DM1 led to clinical improvement in hypoxia in three of the four patients. The spectrum of liver injury that occurs with long-term use of T-DM1 remains incompletely defined. As T-DM1 is approved for use in the management of early-stage operable and advanced breast cancer, awareness of HPS as a potential complication of long-term administration of T-DM1 is necessary. The emergence of dyspnea alone or combined with low oxygen saturation and signs of hypoxemia (clubbing or elevated hemoglobin) should raise clinical suspicion and prompt evaluation for HPS. Cancer care team members should be vigilant regarding the potential for new and serious side effects associated with novel targeted therapies, which may emerge years beyond initial regulatory approval.",

The study included 116 patients with HER-2\u2009+\u2009breast cancer who received concurrent treatment with trastuzumab and RT (52 right-side; 64 left-side). Five left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements were performed: one before treatment and four subsequent measurements taken at three-month intervals. LVEF was also assessed before (preRT-EF) and after (postRT-EF) radiotherapy. The baseline LVEF was 62.27\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5%, while the 12-month LVEF was 59.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8% (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In subgroups, post-RT LVEF values \u200b\u200bwere significantly lower than pre-RT LVEF values (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant difference was found between the reduction in LVEF for patients receiving 50\u00a0Gy and 60\u00a0Gy doses. Moreover, the contribution of regional lymph node irradiation to the decrease in LVEF could not be demonstrated. A positive correlation was found between the total trastuzumab dose and the decrease in LVEF from preRT to postRT. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the total taxane dose and the reduction in LVEF from baseline to 9\u00a0months, both in the overall group and in the left breast cancer group. In our study,it was found that not only trastuzumab but also taxane-based agents could be cardiotoxic. However, no connection was found between RT doses and the decrease in LVEF.",

In the overall population, the objective response rate (ORR) was 72.7%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 90.9%, and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was six months. Among them, two patients temporarily discontinued treatment after two cycles of T-DXd due to financial reasons, but their disease remained stable for 5 and 8 months, respectively. Efficacy was better in patients with HER-2 amplification, who had not previously used antibody drug conjugates (ADC) drugs, were sensitive to anti-HER-2 treatment, and had \u22643 lines of therapy. Common adverse reactions during T-DXd treatment included gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, as well as haematological toxicities, decreased appetite, hair loss, and fatigue. Some patients experienced gastritis, abnormal liver function, and weight gain, but none of the patients developed interstitial pneumonia. T-DXd can achieve significant and durable survival benefits with controllable safety in patients with HER2-positive or HER2 low-expressing mBC.

    "abstract": "As the first anti-HER2 targeted agent approved by FDA in 1998, Trastuzumab has significantly improved the outcome of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to trastuzumab is a severe obstacle to its therapeutic efficacy in clinical application, and its mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In our study, we found that stabilization of cyclin D3 could be one reason for trastuzumab resistance. Trastuzumab could induce G1/G0 phase arrest by downregulating cyclin D3 protein expression. However, the protein expression of cyclin D3 was not affected in trastuzumab-resistant cells, which might be related to aberrant activation of ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, degradation of cyclin D3 protein by trastuzumab was mainly resulted from ubiquitin-dependent proteasome mechanism instead of transcriptional regulation. In trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells, trastuzumab-induced degradation of cyclin D3 protein was abrogated. When the ubiquitin pathway was inhibited, cells would show a predisposition to resistance to trastuzumab. Further, CDK4/6 inhibitor can inhibit the proliferation of trastuzumab-resistant HER-2 positive breast cancer cells. Therefore, combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and anti-HER2 targeted therapy may be an alternative and promising strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance in the future.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the capability of a drug to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an unmet medical need in patients with positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 positive) and brain metastases. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) lapatinib, neratinib, and tucatinib in co-administration with monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapy drugs and the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) trastuzumab-deruxtecan and trastuzumab-emtansine. Predicting the BBB permeability of these therapeutic agents is a pharmacological challenge due to the various factors involved in the barrier functions. In this review article, we discuss about the molecular and cellular features of the barriers located in the central nervous system and the pharmacological parameters found to be important in predicting BBB permeability in human normal brain, and in the presence of brain metastases. Finally, we reported the clinical outcomes and intracranial response of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases treated with targeted TKIs and ADCs.",

    "title": "The \"lows\": Update on ER-low and HER2-low breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "ER-low and HER2-low breast cancers have emerged as clinically significant subtypes that challenge traditional diagnostic categories and treatment paradigms. These subtypes, representing a spectrum of disease, exhibit distinct biological behaviors, therapeutic responses, and prognostic outcomes. HER2-low breast cancer, defined by low HER2 protein expression (IHC score of 1+ or 2+ without HER2 gene amplification), has achieved clinical significance, particularly following the DESTINY-Breast trials, which demonstrated the efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in the population of patients with advanced HER2-low disease. Similarly, ER-low breast cancer, characterized by low estrogen receptor expression (in 1%-10\u00a0% invasive tumor cells), poses unique challenges due to its intermediate biological behavior and uncertain response to endocrine therapies. The identification of these subtypes is further complicated by inconsistencies in testing methodologies, which can lead to misclassification and impact treatment decisions. As our understanding of these subtypes improves, the need for standardized diagnostic approaches and individualized therapeutic decisions becomes increasingly urgent. Ongoing research and collaboration between pathologists and oncologists are essential for refining diagnostic criteria and improving outcomes for patients with breast cancers characterized by low expression of these theragnostic biomarkers. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge on HER2-low and ER-low breast cancers, focusing on the challenges associated with their identification, the implications for treatment, and future directions in clinical management. By examining recent studies and interlaboratory assessments, this review emphasizes the critical need for accurate and reproducible testing and reporting, and for the development of tailored therapeutic strategies for these \"low\" expression cancers.",

    "title": "Trastuzumab-Induced Early Corneal Melt in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Case Report and Review.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 1998 for metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer therapy. It selectively binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 and mediates an antibody-dependent cellular toxicity in various tissues. Trastuzumab use alone does not typically cause aggressive ocular complications. However, herein is a case report of a patient presenting with corneal ulceration in both eyes and perforation in the left eye after 2 months of trastuzumab therapy. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy was consulted for ophthalmic evaluation. She denied any history of ocular conditions and complained of eyelid crusting and sandy sensation in both eyes for 2 weeks. She had been using antibiotic eyedrops for presumed eye infection before her vision deteriorated 3-4 days prior to presentation. A thorough workup for autoimmune and infectious diseases was unyielding. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple epithelial defects with ulceration in the right eye and a corneal ulcer with perforation in the left eye. Corneal cultures were negative. Orbital imaging revealed metastases with optic nerve compression. In conjunction with the oncology team, further trastuzumab treatment was deferred. Therapeutic keratoplasty along with ocular surface therapy eventually stabilized both eyes. CONCLUSIONS Ocular adverse effects such as corneal epithelial changes and melts have been reported with trastuzumab. We recommend ophthalmology consultation for any ocular symptoms in patients on trastuzumab treatment.",

She had fever and her PS was 3, and her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 6.47 mg/dL due to inflammation by a G-CSF-producing tumor. Thus, we initiated the administration of dexamethasone (3.3 mg/day). Her fever abated the next day, and CRP dropped to 3.22 mg/dL after 4 days. Driver mutations were negative, and PD-L1, tumor proportion score, was highly expressed at 100%. Thus, pembrolizumab was started. Subsequently, the white blood cell count decreased, and the tumor shrank, indicating a partial response. After three cycles of pembrolizumab therapy, the anorexia improved, and she was discharged. The patient developed sclerosing cholangitis after discharge. Therefore, the pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued. The primary lesion was enlarged, indicating progressive disease. However, the patient and her family did not want additional treatment. Finally, her progression-free survival and overall survival were 6 and 7 months, respectively. Pembrolizumab may be effective against G-CSF-producing NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression. Corticosteroids seemed to inhibit inflammation induced by the tumor, and exert the efficacy of pembrolizumab.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and aggressive subtype, with high breast cancer mortality. Compared to noninflammatory breast cancer, even after treatment and response to standard-of-care breast cancer chemotherapy, it has a high propensity for lymph node involvement, high rates of distant metastasis, and shorter survival. The immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in combination with chemotherapy is now approved for early triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and for advanced disease if positive for the programmed cell death ligand 1 protein (PD-L1). The response and survival of metastatic inflammatory TNBC to immunotherapy is largely unreported and we present a case of a young woman with metastatic triple negative inflammatory breast cancer, treated with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. A 46-year-old female presented with de novo metastatic inflammatory TNBC with metastasis to lymph nodes, lung, and bones. She was treated with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel leading to rapid and complete radiographic response. The response was however short lived, and the patient presented with diffuse disease progression in the lungs with pleural effusions, causing death from respiratory distress. Treatment for metastatic triple negative inflammatory breast cancer mirrors treatment of metastatic TNBC. In PD-L1 positive disease, treatment with chemotherapy and pembrolizumab is first line and in this case led to robust but short-lived response. Inflammatory breast cancer remains a poorly understood breast cancer subtype, and even in the presence of good treatment response, prognosis and survival remain poor. Further studies are warranted to better understand and treat the disease.",

FCGR3A encodes the receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G that has been linked to the trastuzumab response. Our study aimed to investigate the association of FCGR3A-V158F gene polymorphism with breast cancer and to evaluate the impact of FCGR3A-V158F gene polymorphism on trastuzumab response in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The study was conducted on eighty breast cancer patients who were collected from the Department of Oncology at Ain Shams University Hospitals; in addition, twenty age-matched healthy subjects were taken as a healthy control group. Patients were further sub-classified according to their responses. The study showed that there were no statistically significant differences between patients and controls regarding FCGR3A-V158F gene polymorphism genotypes. However, there was a significant association between the concordance of this polymorphism and the response to trastuzumab therapy among the patient's group. V/V is associated with better treatment response and overall survival (OS) compared to F/V and F/F alleles. Assessment of FCGR3A-V158F gene polymorphism might be useful in making a treatment decision in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The ZEPHIR clinical trial evaluated the role of [89Zr]trastuzumab-PET/CT (HER2-PET/CT) and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) in predicting outcomes in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). In this study, we combined molecular/metabolic imaging and transcriptomic data to investigate the biological processes associated with [89Zr]trastuzumab and [18F]FDG uptake and to dissect the mechanisms involved in T-DM1 resistance. RNA was extracted from metastasis biopsies obtained in the ZEPHIR trial. HER2-PET/CT and [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging data of biopsied lesions were integrated with transcriptomic data. Lesions were compared based on the level of [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake as well as on the presence/absence of metabolic response, defined comparing baseline and on-treatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT. We analyzed matched transcriptomic and molecular/metabolic imaging data for 24 metastases. Genes and pathways involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and glycosylphosphatidylinositol synthesis were enriched in lesions presenting low [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake. [18F]FDG uptake at baseline correlated with proliferation and immune-related processes. Hypoxia and ECM-related processes were enriched in lesions showing no metabolic response to T-DM1, whereas immune-related processes were associated with high [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake and metabolic response. Gene signatures including differentially expressed genes according to [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake and metabolic response showed predictive value in an external cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first correlative analysis between [89Zr]trastuzumab tumor uptake and gene expression profiling in humans. Our findings suggest a role for ECM in impairing [89Zr]trastuzumab tumor uptake and T-DM1 metabolic response in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, highlighting the potential of molecular imaging to depict tumor microenvironment features.",

    "abstract": "For patients with advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without actionable genomic alterations and low (<50%) PD-L1 expression, pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy is a preferred first-line treatment. These patients have comparatively worse outcomes than those with higher PD-L1 expression, underscoring the need for new combination strategies. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, has demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity and safety in this patient population. We describe the rationale and design of TROPION-Lung07, a randomized, open-label Phase III study assessing Dato-DXd in combination with pembrolizumab with/without platinum-based chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations and <50% PD-L1 expression. Primary study objectives are progression-free survival and overall survival. Most patients discover they have non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after it has already spread beyond the lungs (metastasized) making it more challenging to treat. If patients with NSCLC also lack specific genetic changes, called \u201cactionable genomic alterations\u201d, or have low levels of a protein called PD-L1 (which cancer cells use to avoid attack from the immune system and continue to grow), current treatments may not fully help, or only help for a while. However, newer approaches are being investigated that may benefit these patients with fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational drug which combines an antibody with a chemotherapy agent to specifically target and kill cancer cells. The antibody in Dato-DXd attaches to a protein called TROP2, which is widely expressed in NSCLC tumors, and delivers chemotherapy directly into cancer cells to kill them. The TROPION-Lung07 study will assess the potential benefits and side effects of adding Dato-DXd to other drugs, including pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy which attaches to PD-1 on immune cells and triggers the death of cancer cells) and chemotherapy. Three treatment groups will be compared: pembrolizumab with chemotherapy; Dato-DXd with pembrolizumab; and Dato-DXd with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. The study will help us to understand if adding Dato-DXd to other anticancer drugs allow patients to live longer without their disease getting worse.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer, with a greater risk of metastasis and recurrence. Research studies have published in-depth analyses of the advantages and disadvantages of pembrolizumab, and early data from numerous trials suggests that patients with mTNBC have had remarkable outcomes. This meta-analysis compares the data from numerous relevant studies in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy or combination therapies for mTNBC. To identify eligible RCTs, a thorough literature search was carried out using electronic databases. CMA software was utilized to perform heterogeneity tests using fixed and random-effects models. According to our pooled data, the median Progression-free Survival (PFS) was 2.66 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 12.26 months. Furthermore, by comparing efficacy indicators between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative groups, a correlation was found between the overexpression of PD-L1 with OS, PFS, and ORR. Patients with PD-L1-positive tumors had a higher response rate, with an ORR of 21.1%, compared to the patients with PD-L1-negative tumors. The ORR for first-line immunotherapy was higher than that of \u2265second-line immunotherapy. In addition, pembrolizumab plus combination treatment resulted in a pooled incidence of immune- related adverse events of 22.7%. A modest response to pembrolizumab monotherapy was detected in the mTNBC patients. Furthermore, a better outcome from pembrolizumab treatment may be predicted by PD-L1-- positive status, non-liver/lung metastases, combination therapy, and first-line immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab, in combination with chemotherapy, may be more beneficial for patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive.",

Patients with HER2(+) EBC who received NAST between 1 Jan 2019 and 31 Jan 2022 were reviewed. IDFS was defined as the time from surgery until first occurrence of invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. The total cohort was 594 patients. pCR (ypT0/isN0) was achieved in 325(55%) and RD was seen in 269(45%) patients. In 269 patients with RD, 45(17%) did not have HER2 retesting and were excluded.

In those with RD, 36% lost HER2(+) status; IDFS events appeared similar in those with HER2(+) RD versus those with HER2(-) RD. The BM events seen in those with RD and pCR highlights the need for more effective therapy in NAST and adjuvant setting to minimize BM risk.",

    "abstract": "Almost one-fifth of breast cancer cases express Human Epidermal Growth Factor-2 (HER2), and such expression is associated with highly proliferative tumors and poor prognosis. The introduction of anti-HER2 therapies has dramatically changed the natural course of this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. However, anti-HER2 therapy can be associated with substantial toxicities, mostly cardiac, and high cost. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in de-escalation of anti-HER2 therapies to minimize adverse events and healthcare costs, while maintaining the efficacy of treatment. Data from clinical observations and single-arm studies have eluted to the minimal impact of anti-HER2 therapy in low-risk patients, like those with node-negative and small tumors. Though single-arm, the APT trial, in which patients with node-negative, small tumors received single-agent paclitaxel for 12 cycles plus trastuzumab for 1 year, was a practice-changing study. Several other recently published studies, like the PERSEPHONE trial, have shown more convincing data that 6 months of trastuzumab is not inferior to 12 months, in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), suggesting that de-escalating strategies with shorter treatment may be appropriate for some low-risk patients. Other de-escalating strategies involved an adaptive, response-directed approach, and personalized therapy that depends on tumor genomic profiling.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis inhibitors are known to modify tumor immunity. Combination of angiogenesis inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown efficacy against many types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the feasibility of neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab and ramucirumab, a VEGFR-2 antagonist for patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC, and its influence on the tumor microenvironment. Patients with pathologically proven, PD-L1-positive, clinical stage IB to IIIA NSCLC were eligible. Patients received two cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg/body) and ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. Surgery was scheduled 4 to 8 weeks after the last dose. The primary endpoint was the major pathologic response rate by a blinded independent pathologic review. The sample size was 24 patients. Exploratory endpoints were evaluated to elucidate the effects of neoadjuvant therapy on the tumor microenvironment. The 24 eligible patients were enrolled between July 2019 and April 2022. The major pathologic response rate was 50.0% (90% confidence interval, 31.9%-68.1%). Six patients showed pathologic complete response. Grade 3 adverse events (AE) occurred in nine patients (37.5%), including three immune-related AEs (acute tubulointerstitial nephritis in two cases and polymyalgia rheumatica in one case). There were no grade 4 or 5 AEs. The transcriptome and multiplex IHC results suggested that tumors with greater CD8+ T-cell infiltration and higher expression of effector molecules at the baseline could show better sensitivity to treatment. This new neoadjuvant combination of pembrolizumab plus ramucirumab was feasible, and anti-VEGF agents may enhance the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is distinguished by negative expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), making it an aggressive subtype of breast cancer and contributes to 15-20% of the total incidence. TNBC is a diverse disease with various genetic variations and molecular subtypes. The tumor microenvironment involves multiple cells, including immune cells, fibroblast cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and blood vessels that constantly interact with tumor cells and influence each other. The ECM undergoes significant structural changes, leading to induced cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The involvement of EMT in the occurrence and development of tumors through invasion and metastasis in TNBC has been a matter of concern. Therefore, EMT markers could be prognostic predictors and potential therapeutic targets in TNBC. Chemotherapy has been one of the primary options for treating patients with TNBC, but its efficacy against TNBC is still limited. Targeted therapy is a critical emerging option with enhanced efficacy and less adverse effects on patients. Various targeted therapy approaches have been developed based on the specific molecules and the signaling pathways involved in TNBC. These include inhibitors of signaling pathways such as TGF-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB and EGFR, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, 2laparib, and talazoparib have been widely explored. This article reviews recent developments in EMT in TNBC invasion and metastasis and potential targeted therapy strategies.",

However, prior to NAST only clinical nodal staging is available, risking undertreatment if ypN+ is observed. Here, we aim to evaluate the impact of FDG-PET/CT and NAST on nodal disease status in patients with small, node-negative HER2+ BC. This retrospective study included patients with small (\u22643\u00a0cm), clinically node-negative HER2+ BC diagnosed between 2011 and 2023. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients with nodal disease on final pathology after upfront surgery or NAST followed by surgery with or without FDG-PET/CT. Patients received either paclitaxel\u00a0+\u00a0trastuzumab (PT) or a more extensive regimen. Of the 370 included patients, 183 underwent FDG-PET/CT, detecting regional or distant metastases in 14 patients (7.7\u00a0%). Among 356 patients with cN0 disease, 44.1\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0157/356) had upfront surgery, with only 3\u00a0% (5/157) having an FDG-PET/CT.

In this open-label, randomized, phase III trial, T-Duo was compared with physician's choice (PC) in patients with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic HER2+ breast cancer with progression during/after \u22652 HER2-targeted therapies or after trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. In total, 437 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to T-Duo (n = 291) or PC (n = 146). The median age was 56.0 years (range, 24-86); most patients (93.6%) had metastatic disease. The median time from diagnosis of metastatic disease to trial entry was 3.5 years; the median number of prior HER2-targeted therapies in metastatic setting was three. The median PFS was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 7.2) with T-Duo versus 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 5.5; hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84];  Treatment with T-Duo was manageable, but tolerability was affected by prevalent ocular toxicity, leading to a higher discontinuation rate in the T-Duo arm.

    "title": "Trends in the prescription of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer in the Netherlands from 2016 to 2020, a national cancer registry analysis.",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality globally, with a 5-year survival rate of 10-20%. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer. The approval of nivolumab in 2015 marked a milestone in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, leading to ongoing trials and approvals of new ICI drugs that have reshaped treatment strategies and clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer. This study aims to describe ICIs prescription trends for NSCLC in the Netherlands and their association with survival. We compared our results with data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We analyzed ICIs prescription trends and their relationship with survival using national-level data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) for first-line treatments from 2016-2020. Additionally, we performed a secondary analysis using data from the Oncological Life Study (OncoLifeS) for any-line treatments. Descriptive statistics and annual percentage change (APC) assessed trends in patient and treatment characteristics. OS analyses were performed. In the Netherlands (2016-2020), the proportion of first-line ICI-treated NSCLC patients significantly increased from 1.1% to 54.9% (APC =14.5%, P=0.002), replacing chemotherapy monotherapy. Stage III ICI-treated patients' proportion increased (APC =3.5%, P=0.034), while the proportion of ICI-treated patients with \u226550% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression decreased (APC =-13.82%, P=0.04). Two-year OS was 25.9%. Median OS remained stable, increasing from 2016 to 2018 (16.6 to 19.4 months) and declining slightly in 2019 and 2020 (17.3 and 16.6 months, respectively). In the secondary analysis, median OS varied by treatment line, being 18.8, 9.4 and 7.5 months for first-, second- and third-line treated patients respectively. Using real-world data, we determined that ICI-based therapies replaced chemotherapy-only schemes as first-line treatment for NSCLC. Our survival data are comparable with data from RCTs on first-line ICI-treated NSCLC. Median OS of ICI treated patients has remained stable, with small decreases in recent years possibly attributed to the proportional decrease of individuals with high PD-L1 expressions in treatment regimens. Further-line treatments are associated with lower survival.",

    "title": "Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer treated with low dose lapatinib in a resource-constrained setting in South India: a retrospective audit.",
    "abstract": "Despite the development of newer anti-Her2 agents, access to these medicines is still restricted with lapatinib being widely used as a second-line agent in Her2-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, lapatinib at approved doses of 1,250 to 1,500 mg/day contributes to a high pill burden and financial toxicity. In a population that has an average national per capita income of only USD 2238.1, lapatinib alone contributes to a financial burden of USD 6153.56 per year (approximately USD 500 per month). A concept of 'value meal' has been suggested - the higher bioavailability of lapatinib with the meal being exploited to reduce its administered dose. This concept was utilised in a resource-constrained tertiary care center in South India and we report the outcomes. In our institution, consecutive patients with Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 who could not afford trastuzumab, lapatinib or any other anti-Her2 agent were offered low-dose lapatinib, 500 mg daily with meal. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the safety and efficacy of this regimen. Among the 47 patients who received low-dose lapatinib, the majority had de novo metastatic disease (57.4%) and multiple visceral metastases (48.9%). The median number of lines of treatment before lapatinib was one. The disease control rate with lapatinib was 61.7%. The median progression-free survival was 7 months (95% CI: 5.6-8.4 months). The median duration of response was 4.5 months, ranging from 1.3 to 45.8 months. Only eleven patients (23.4%) experienced toxicity, mainly dermatological, with grade 3 in only one (2.1%) and no grade 4 toxicities. Low-dose lapatinib is a regimen that offers an acceptable disease control rate. This strategy requires further exploration, particularly for the benefit of resource-limited areas.",

    "abstract": "Loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are common events implicated in the primary resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to immunotherapy. However, there is no data on perioperative chemoimmunotherapy (ChIO) efficacy or response mechanisms in the context of HLA class I defects. Baseline HLA class I tumor status (HLA-deficient (HLA-DEF) or HLA-proficient (HLA-PRO)) was determined by DNA LOH combined with immunohistochemistry for protein levels in tissue of 24 patients with NSCLC treated with perioperative nivolumab plus chemotherapy from NADIM trial (NCT03081689). We integrated HLA tumor status with molecular data (programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), TMB, TCR repertoire, TILs populations, bulk RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (ST)) and clinical outcomes (pathological response and survival data) to study the activity of perioperative ChIO considering HLA class I defects. HLA-DEF tumors comprised 41.7% of analyzed tumors and showed a desert-like microenvironment at baseline, with lower PD-L1 levels and reduced immune infiltrate. However, perioperative ChIO induced similar complete pathological response (CPR) rates in both HLA-DEF and PRO tumors (50% and 60% respectively, p=0.670), as well as 3-year survival rates: Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 70% (95% CI 32.9% to 89.2%) for HLA-DEF, and PFS 71.4% (95% CI 40.6% to 88.2%) and OS 92.9% (95% CI 59.1% to 99.0%) for HLA-PRO (log-rank PFS p=0.909, OS p=0.137). Proof-of-concept ST analysis of a CPR HLA-DEF tumor after ChIO showed a strong immune response with tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), CD4+T cells with HLA class II colocalization, and activated CD8+T cells. Our findings highlight the activity of perioperative ChIO, and the potential role of TLS and T-cell immune response, in NSCLC HLA-DEF tumors.",

    "abstract": "Exploration of novel combination mode of pyrotinib and chemotherapy for heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and how to balance survival benefits and compliance are still urgent problems in clinical practice. The current single-arm prospective phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in combination with metronomic oral etoposide in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC. HER2-positive MBC patients previously treated with trastuzumab were enrolled to receive oral pyrotinib 400\u00a0mg per day and metronomic oral etoposide 50\u00a0mg per day d1-21 every 28 days, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS), and safety. 22 patients were enrolled with a median of 4 prior treatment regimens for MBC. During the follow-up of 20 evaluable patients, the median PFS was 9.0 months (95% CI, 7.6-10.4 months), and the median OS was 27.0 months (95%CI, 20.9-33.1 months). The ORR was 30% (6/20), the DCR was 80% (16/20), and the CBR was 65% (13/20). The most common grade 3 adverse events (AEs) included nausea (15%), vomiting (15%), diarrhea (5%), anemia (5%), and peripheral neuropathy (5%). No grade 4 or lethal AEs were observed. The combination of pyrotinib with metronomic oral etoposide has achieved promising clinical benefits in heavily pretreated HER2-positive MBC, with acceptable and manageable toxicity.

    "abstract": "Dual anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) blockade has improved the outcomes of patients with early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Here we present the final 10-year analysis of the ALTTO trial. The ALTTO trial (NCT00490139) is a prospective randomized, phase III, open-label, multicenter study that investigated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab alone, in combination or sequentially with lapatinib. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), time to distant recurrence and safety. Overall, 6281 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer were included in the final efficacy analysis in three treatment groups: trastuzumab (T), lapatinib\u00a0+ trastuzumab (L\u00a0+ T) and trastuzumab followed by lapatinib (T\u2192L). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, the addition of lapatinib to trastuzumab and chemotherapy did not significantly improve DFS nor OS. The 10-year DFS was 77% in T, 79% in L\u00a0+ T and 79% in T\u2192L, and the 10-year OS was 87%, 89% and 89%, respectively. The incidence of any cardiac event was low and similar in the three treatment groups. With a longer follow-up, no significant improvement was observed in DFS in patients treated with dual anti-HER2 blockade with lapatinib\u00a0+ trastuzumab compared to trastuzumab alone. The 10-year survival rates for the combination group are consistent with other studies that have explored dual anti-HER2 therapy.",

While most early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer patients benefit from combining trastuzumab monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy, the therapeutic response to various drug combinations varies across the HER2+ patient population. Therefore, predicting the prognosis and treatment response of HER2+ breast cancer patients to specific regimens is crucial for selecting appropriate precision individualized therapies. HER2DX is the first genomic tool designed to guide the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients. The three scores provided by HER2DX inform the entire treatment process, including predicting survival outcomes, recurrence, metastasis, and treatment responses like Pathological Complete Response Rate (pCR). It offers recommendations on follow-up intervals, treatment plans, and the duration of drug therapy.

    "abstract": "Nanocarriers have found their interests in many fields including drug delivery and labeling of cells with the aim to target and eradicate tumor cells. One of the approaches to specifically address nanocarriers, such as liposomes, to their target is to attach antibodies of interest to their surface. To date, the development of immunoliposomes has been widely explored but has mainly involved chemical and unspecific reactions that could impair antibody stability, integrity, and orientation, thus reducing optimized immunoliposomes generation. In this study, we report the use of the patented COVISOLINK technology and the strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) to generate immunoliposomes that target HER2 positive breast cancer with Trastuzumab as the antibody to be coupled. The efficacy of our two-step functionalization strategy and the successful specific coupling of the antibodies were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography-size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC), which allowed a precise quantification of antibodies conjugated to liposomes and confirmed by cryo-TEM and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analyses. We also demonstrate by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy that the produced anti-HER2 immunoliposomes were able to interact specifically with their target cells (SK-BR-3) while remaining negative with cells that express HER2 at a low level (MDA-MB-231). Hence, for the first time, our COVISOLINK strategy using microbial transglutaminase (mTG) enables the preparation and production of well-characterized immunoliposomes that could be used in different applications, including therapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite the global use of trastuzumab biosimilars, concerns remain regarding their efficacy and safety. In particular, when used concurrently with pertuzumab, trastuzumab biosimilars lack extensive real-world data and safety information. Additionally, as cancer drug expenditures continue to rise worldwide, cost savings from biosimilars have become increasingly important. This study aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of trastuzumab originators and their biosimilars in real-world clinical settings, focusing on a large patient population. The analysis included 31,661 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer from the Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd. database in Japan. Additionally, adverse event reports for the trastuzumab originator and its biosimilars were obtained for 58,799 patients from the World Health Organization's VigiBase, the global adverse event reporting database. No significant differences were observed in heart failure hospitalizations, liver dysfunction, or infusion reaction rates in both the Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd. database and the World Health Organization's VigiBase. In the Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd. database, the addition of pertuzumab did not significantly influence the incidence of adverse events, and the use of biosimilars significantly reduced medical costs, with no significant difference in breast cancer recurrence rates. By analyzing two large and diverse datasets from multiple perspectives, we obtained reliable results that the trastuzumab originator and its biosimilars have similar safety profiles. The concurrent use of pertuzumab was also found to be safe. The use of biosimilars can lead to cost savings. These findings provide crucial insights for the evaluation and adoption of biosimilars in clinical practice.",

Despite initial control of intracranial disease, patients experienced neurological deterioration months to years post-treatment. Radiological assessments revealed distinct patterns consistent with radiation necrosis, particularly in areas previously treated with SRS and subsequent T-DM1 administration. These changes, characterized by enlarging cystic masses with hemorrhagic components, emphasize the importance of vigilant monitoring in patients undergoing combined SRS and T-DM1 therapy for brain metastatic breast cancer. This report underscores the need for further investigation into the long-term effects of combining SRS with novel systemic therapies, particularly in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases. Understanding and mitigating late neurotoxicity are critical for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Present and Future of Immunotherapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and progesterone receptors (PRs). TNBC has the poorest prognosis among breast cancer subtypes and is more likely to respond to immunotherapy due to its higher expression of PD-L1 and a greater percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Immunotherapy has revolutionized TNBC treatment, especially with the FDA's approval of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) combined with chemotherapy for advanced cases, opening new avenues for treating this deadly disease. Although immunotherapy can significantly improve patient outcomes in a subset of patients, achieving the desired response rate for all remains an unmet clinical goal. Strategies that enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade, including combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, or radiotherapy, may improve response rates and clinical outcomes. In this review, we provide a short background on TNBC and immunotherapy and explore the different types of immunotherapy strategies that are currently being evaluated in TNBC. Additionally, we review why combination strategies may be beneficial, provide an overview of the combination strategies, and discuss the novel immunotherapeutic opportunities that may be approved in the near future for TNBC.",

    "abstract": "This multicenter phase Ib study investigated trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) plus nivolumab in patients with HER2-expressing metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). Part 1 determined the recommended dose for expansion of T-DXd plus nivolumab. Part 2 evaluated efficacy and safety; the primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate by independent central review. In part 1, seven patients with mBC were enrolled and received T-DXd 3.2 mg/kg (four patients) or 5.4 mg/kg (three patients) plus nivolumab. The recommended dose for expansion for T-DXd was 5.4 mg/kg plus nivolumab 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. In part 2, 32 patients with HER2-positive mBC (cohort 1; inclusive of three administered 5.4 mg/kg in part 1), 16 with HER2-low mBC (cohort 2), 30 with HER2-high mUC (cohort 3), and four with HER2-low mUC (cohort 4) were enrolled. At data cutoff (July 22, 2021), the confirmed objective response rates (95% confidence interval) for cohorts 1 to 4 were 65.6% (46.8%-81.4%), 50.0% (24.7%-75.3%), 36.7% (19.9%-56.1%), and not assessed due to small sample size, respectively. The median treatment duration (range) with T-DXd in cohorts 1 to 4 was 8.9 (1-23) months, 6.9 (1-21) months, 3.9 (1-21) months, and not assessed, respectively; the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was nausea (55.2%, 62.5%, 73.3%, and 75.0%, respectively). Adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis rates (cohorts 1-3) were 20.7%, 0%, and 20.0%, respectively (one grade 5 each, cohorts 1 and 3). T-DXd plus nivolumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in HER2-expressing mBC or mUC and safety consistent with the known profile of T-DXd. Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis is an important risk and requires careful monitoring and prompt intervention.",

    "title": "CD81-guided heterologous EVs present heterogeneous interactions with breast cancer cells.",
    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-secreted particles conceived as natural vehicles for intercellular communication. The capacity to entrap heterogeneous molecular cargoes and target specific cell populations through EV functionalization promises advancements in biomedical applications. However, the efficiency of the obtained EVs, the contribution of cell-exposed receptors to EV interactions, and the predictability of functional cargo release with potential sharing of high molecular weight recombinant mRNAs are crucial for advancing heterologous EVs in targeted therapy applications. In this work, we selected the popular EV marker CD81 as a transmembrane guide for fusion proteins with a C-terminal GFP reporter encompassing or not Trastuzumab light chains targeting the HER2 receptor. We performed high-content imaging analyses to track EV-cell interactions, including isogenic breast cancer cells with manipulated HER2 expression. We validated the functional cargo delivery of recombinant EVs carrying doxorubicin upon EV-donor cell treatment. Then, we performed an in vivo study using JIMT-1 cells commonly used as HER2-refractory, trastuzumab-resistant model to detect a more than 2000 nt length recombinant mRNA in engrafted tumors. Fusion proteins participated in vesicular trafficking dynamics and accumulated on secreted EVs according to their expression levels in HEK293T cells. Despite the presence of GFP, secreted EV populations retained a HER2 receptor-binding capacity and were used to track EV-cell interactions. In time-frames where the global EV distribution did not change between HER2-positive (SK-BR-3) or -negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines, the HER2 exposure in isogenic cells remarkably affected the tropism of heterologous EVs, demonstrating the specificity of antiHER2 EVs representing about 20% of secreted bulk vesicles. The specific interaction strongly correlated with improved cell-killing activity of doxorubicin-EVs in MDA-MB-231 ectopically expressing HER2 and reduced toxicity in SK-BR-3 with a knocked-out HER2 receptor, overcoming the effects of the free drug. Interestingly, the fusion protein-corresponding transcripts present as full-length mRNAs in recombinant EVs could reach orthotopic breast tumors in JIMT-1-xenografted mice, improving our sensitivity in detecting penetrant cargoes in tissue biopsies. This study highlights the quantitative aspects underlying the creation of a platform for secreted heterologous EVs and shows the limits of single receptor-ligand interactions behind EV-cell engagement mechanisms, which now become the pivotal step to predict functional tropism and design new generations of EV-based nanovehicles.",

Despite its high efficacy, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a severe adverse event (AE) associated with T-DXd. This report describes a patient who was successfully treated with a dose-reduced T-DXd challenge after recovery from ILD. Little disease progression was observed during the treatment interruption period; thus, the effect of T-DXd was considered to have been maintained.

    "abstract": "While trastuzumab has been shown to improve disease-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, it may also cause trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC). Although racial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), limited data exists on TIC incidence in diverse multi-ethnic populations. Our objective was to assess racial and ethnic differences in TIC and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients diagnosed with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer between 2007 and 2022 who had received adjuvant trastuzumab. We analyzed associations between sociodemographic factors, tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, and CVD risk factors with the primary outcomes of TIC and LVEF recovery, using multivariable logistic regression models. TIC was defined as >\u200910% decrease in LVEF to an overall LVEF\u2009<\u200950%; LVEF recovery as a return to a LVEF\u2009>\u200950%. Among 496 evaluable patients, median age was 53 years (IQR: 45.0-62.0) with 36.6% NHW, 15.8% non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 27.8% Hispanic, and 19.8% Other. Fifty-three (10.6%) patients developed TIC, half of whom experienced LVEF recovery. Compared to NHW, NHB had a higher rate of TIC (9.3% vs. 17.7%, respectively) and lower rate of LVEF recovery (70.6% vs. 21.4%, respectively), however, race/ethnicity was not a significant predictor of TIC after adjusting for confounders. Increasing age, lower baseline LVEF, anthracycline use, and presence of hypertension or coronary artery disease were significantly associated with TIC in multivariable analysis. TIC was more common among NHB compared to NHW, however, Black race was not consistently associated with TIC after adjustment for CVD risk factors. This suggests that CVD comorbidities (e.g., hypertension) that more frequently affect racial and ethnic minorities and are modifiable may explain differences in TIC incidence and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a complex disease characterised by abnormal cell growth in breast tissue. Trastuzumab is a targeted therapy that inhibits the HER-2 receptor and suppresses tumour growth. We aimed to determine if the clinical course of the disease could be predicted by early changes in serum levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) following trastuzumab-based therapy. The study enrolled 120 women, divided into an experimental group (60 breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab) and a control group (60 healthy women). Serum samples were collected before each weekly trastuzumab treatment. In addition, human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and AMJ13 were cultured in vitro and treated with trastuzumab. The study assessed cell viability using a cytotoxicity assay (methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium) and measured HER-2 protein levels. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined to evaluate the effect of trastuzumab on breast cancer. The results showed that breast cancer patients had significantly lower serum levels of HER-2 compared to the control group. The cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that increasing trastuzumab concentration enhanced growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in the cell lines. There was a significant difference in IC50 between the MCF-7 and AMJ13 cell lines. The study provides valuable insights into the effects of trastuzumab on serum HER-2 levels and breast cancer cell lines. These findings have implications for resource allocation and treatment decisions in breast cancer management. By understanding the impact of trastuzumab on HER-2 levels and tumour cells, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions regarding therapy options for patients.",

Although T-DM1 has demonstrated greater efficacy and safety compared to traditional therapies, concerns about hepatotoxicity and spleen-related complications have arisen. We conducted a retrospective study of 64 HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with T-DM1 at our institution. Patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and during treatment cycles. Spleen volume, portal vein diameter, and laboratory values were compared between baseline and 12\u00a0months after T-DM1 treatment. Median spleen volume significantly increased from 201\u00a0cm3 (IQR, 157-275) at baseline to 291\u00a0cm3 (IQR, 215-420) after 12\u00a0months of T-DM1 treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Spleen enlargement was observed in 87.5% of patients, while no significant alteration was detected in portal vein diameter. The change in spleen volume was positively correlated with changes in serum globulin levels, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels, but did not impact survival outcomes. T-DM1 therapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer leads to significant spleen enlargement and systemic biochemical changes. Future studies should focus on elucidating the long-term implications of these findings and optimizing monitoring strategies for spleen-related complications.",

A retrospective bicentric analysis was conducted on triple-negative mBC (mTNBC) patients treated with SG and HER2-low mBC patients treated with T-DXd, who underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT scans before therapy. Key biomarkers, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) and maximum tumor dissemination (Dmax), were measured. Their prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves. 128 patients were included: 71 mTNBC treated with SG and 57 HR-positive and -negative HER2-low mBC treated with T-DXd. Median follow-up was 12.9\u00a0months. In the SG cohort, median PFS and OS were 4.8 and 8.9\u00a0months, respectively. High Dmax (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.3) and high TMTV (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.6) were independently associated with shorter OS. In the T-DXd cohort, median PFS and OS were 5.8 and 9.0\u00a0months, respectively. High Dmax (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) and high TMTV (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-6.5) independently correlated with shorter PFS and shorter OS, respectively. Pretreatment [18F]FDG PET/CT-derived biomarkers, namely TMTV and Dmax, have significant prognostic value in patients with mTNBC and HER2-low mBC treated with SG and T-DXd.

    "abstract": "CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) represent the first-line therapy approach of choice for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (HR\u2009+\u2009/HER-ABC). Approximately 50% of HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2-ABC displays low HER2 expression (HER2 low). Recent data emerging from the DESTINY-Breast04 trial demonstrated practice-changing efficacy of the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in patients with low HER2 expression. Here, we aimed to analyze the impact of low HER2 expression on CDK4/6i therapy response in a well-characterized multicenter HR\u2009+\u2009/HER-ABC cohort. Patients diagnosed with HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2-ABC who were treated with CDK4/6i in clinical routine between November 2016 and December 2020 at four certified German Breast Cancer Centers were retrospectively identified. The cohort was stratified according to graduation of positivity in HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC; HER2 zero\u2009=\u2009IHC score 0 and HER2 low\u2009=\u2009IHC score 1\u2009+\u2009, 2\u2009+\u2009/fluorescence in situ hybridization negative). Subgroups were analyzed with regard to progression-free survival (PFS) following CDK4/6i initiation. The study cohort comprised n\u2009=\u2009448 patients. For n\u2009=\u2009311 patients, HER2 status from the metastatic site was available. n\u2009=\u200991 (29.3%) cases were HER2 zero and n\u2009=\u2009220 cases (70.7%) were HER2 low. There was no significant difference in PFS between the two groups (PFS: 17\u00a0months versus 18\u00a0months, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.42). Further, we examined the influence of HER2 expression changes between primary and metastatic tissue (n\u2009=\u2009171; HER2 gain/HER2 loss/HER2 stable expression) on CDK4/6i treatment response. Again, there was no significant difference between these three groups, respectively (PFS: 16\u00a0months versus 13\u00a0months versus 17\u00a0months, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.86). In our analysis, HER2 status did not have a significant impact on treatment response to CDK4/6i.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. There are four main subtypes of breast cancer, one of which involves positivity for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Here, we present a case series of unusually long survival in three patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. All cases involved post-menopausal women with bone-only metastases undergoing treatment with the HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 ligand (RANK-L) inhibitor denosumab. Our three patients survived for 17, 13, and 11 years, respectively, from the time of metastasis. The patients who survived for 17 and 13 years both presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis, while the patient who survived for 11 years with metastatic disease was known to have non-metastatic breast cancer for four years prior. We also report the development of foot fractures from minor trauma, as low as walking, despite a bone density reported as normal in the patient with 17 years of treatment. These unusually long survival times and the unusual location of the fractures are questioned to be secondary to the long duration of treatment with HER2-targeted therapy and RANK-L inhibitor therapy. Our case series is the first to describe the use of trastuzumab and denosumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. All three reported cases had no clinical or radiographic disease progression at the time of reporting. Furthermore, our case of survival for 17 years represents the longest survival time reported yet, raising the possibility of a synergistic relationship between RANK-L inhibitors and HER2-targeted therapy in the long-term control of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. This manuscript discusses evidence from primary studies on HER2 and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 (RANK) signalling and drug responses and hypothesizes on possible mechanisms of synergism. Given that treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer has historically not involved RANK-L inhibition, this study may outline future areas of research in improving treatment algorithms, especially for bone-only metastatic disease.",

The T-DM1-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles (NPs-T-DM1) reduce binding to megakaryocytes without compromising the targeting ability for HER2. Administration of NPs-T-DM1 not only significantly inhibits tumor growth but also reduces damage to megakaryocytes, inhibits T-DM1-induced thrombocytopenia, and remarkably improves the safety of antibody-conjugated drugs. This work presents a promising strategy to enhance the safety and efficacy of T-DM1 in antitumor therapy, offering significant potential for advancing clinical application in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Nivolumab plus ipilimumab-based treatment regimens have shown long-term, durable efficacy benefits in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Here we report clinical outcomes from a pooled analysis of patients with metastatic NSCLC and tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) lower than 1% treated with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab with or without two cycles of chemotherapy versus up to four cycles of chemotherapy in the randomized phase\u00a03 CheckMate 227 and CheckMate 9LA studies. Patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with no sensitizing EGFR/ALK alterations. Assessments included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, duration of response, and safety. In patients with tumor PD-L1 lower than 1% in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy (n\u00a0= 322) versus chemotherapy (n\u00a0= 315) arms, median OS was 17.4 versus 11.3 months, respectively, (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0= 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.76; 5-y OS rate, 20% versus 7%) at a median follow-up of 73.7 months. The OS benefit was observed across key subgroups, including difficult-to-treat populations such as those with baseline brain metastases (HR\u00a0= 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.75) or squamous NSCLC (HR\u00a0= 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.72). In the overall pooled population, the median PFS was 5.4 versus 4.9 months (HR\u00a0= 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.87; 5-y PFS rate, 9% versus 2%), the objective response rate was 29% versus 22%, and the median duration of response was 18.0 versus 4.6 months. No new safety signals were observed. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy provides a long-term, durable clinical benefit in patients with metastatic NSCLC and tumor PD-L1 lower than 1%, supporting the use of this strategy as a first-line treatment option in this population with high unmet need.

    "abstract": "The PHILA study suggests that pyrotinib, trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the synergistic mechanisms of pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and provide further insights for the PHILA trial. The in\u00a0vitro activity of combination treatments was assessed through cell biological and biochemical experiments. The in\u00a0vivo efficacy was evaluated in cell-derived xenografts, a TUBO tumour model, and one clinical case. Next-generation sequencing was performed on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) from patients in the PHILA trial. The combination of pyrotinib and trastuzumab more effectively inhibited cell growth than pyrotinib or trastuzumab alone in models of HER2-dependent breast cancer. It potentiated membrane HER2 ubiquitination and downregulation, which resulted in a comprehensive blockade of the HER2 signalling pathway. The pyrotinib-altered membrane HER2 levels had no significant effect on trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We further validated the synergistic mechanisms in TUBO tumours and one clinical case, rather than models of HCC1954\u00a0cells harbouring the PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Similarly, in our centre cohort of the PHILA study, patients with genetic alterations in the HER2 signalling cascade had significantly shorter median PFS than individuals with the wild-type pathway. Our findings underscore the robust synergy between pyrotinib and trastuzumab in overcoming HER2 dependency and provide a rationale for pyrotinib, trastuzumab, and docetaxel as one of the optimal choices for patients with untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, who are dependent on the HER2 signalling cascade.

    "abstract": "Tucatinib is a highly selective, oral, reversible, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tucatinib is approved at a 300-mg twice-daily dose in adults in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for advanced HER2-postitive (HER2+) unresectable or metastatic breast cancer and in combination with trastuzumab for RAS wild-type HER2+ unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. This study sought to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess sources of PK variability of tucatinib in healthy volunteers and in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast or colorectal cancers. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on data from four healthy participant studies and three studies in patients with either HER2+ metastatic breast cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. Clinically relevant covariates were evaluated to assess their impact on exposure, and overall model performance was evaluated by prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with linear elimination and first-order absorption preceded by a lag time adequately described tucatinib pharmacokinetic profiles in 151 healthy participants and 132 patients. Tumor type was identified as a significant covariate affecting tucatinib bioavailability and clearance, resulting in a 1.2-fold and 2.1-fold increase in tucatinib steady-state exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) in HER2+ metastatic colorectal cancer and HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, respectively, compared with healthy participants. No other covariates, including mild renal or hepatic impairment, had an impact on tucatinib pharmacokinetics. The impact of statistically significant covariates identified was not considered clinically meaningful. No tucatinib dose adjustments are required based on the covariates tested in the final population pharmacokinetic model.

    "abstract": "Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a relatively poor clinical outcome. The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is the current standard of care in TNBC patients with stage II and III. Monotherapy with ICIs has not been comprehensively assessed in the neoadjuvant setting in TNBC patients, given unfavorable results in metastatic trials. ICIs, however, have been tested in the window of opportunity (WOO) before surgery or standard chemotherapy-based neoadjuvant treatment. The WOO design is well suited to assess an ICI alone or in combination with other ICIs, targeted therapy, radiotherapy or cryotherapy, and measure their pharmacodynamic and clinical effect in this treatment-naive population. Some patients show a good response to ICIs in WOO studies. Biomarkers like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, programmed death ligand-1, and interferon-\u03b3 signature may predict activity and may identify patients likely to benefit from ICIs. Moreover, an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, programmed death ligand-1 expression or T cell receptor expansion following administration of ICIs in the WOO setting could potentially inform of immunotherapy benefit, which would allow tailoring further treatment. This article reviews WOO trials that assessed immunotherapy in the early-stage TNBC population, and how these results could be translated to test de-escalation strategies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy without compromising a patient's prognosis.",

    "abstract": "A subpopulation of women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains at risk for in-breast recurrence (IBR) following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy (RT). The NSABP B-43 trial evaluated the role of concurrent RT and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive DCIS but did not reach the prespecified endpoint. We hypothesized that a 7-gene biosignature (DCISionRT) with its Residual Risk subtype (RRt) could identify 2 groups of HER2(3+) patients with significantly different IBR risks after BCS plus RT. All patients with HER2(3+) DCIS (n = 178) treated with BCS plus RT were selected from a combined multinational patient cohort. Treatment decisions were neither randomized nor strictly rules-based. Biosignature testing was performed on all patients and stratified with previously defined groups: (1) Combined Low Risk group (DS \u2264 2.8) and Elevated Risk group (DS > 2.8) without RRt or (2) Residual Risk subtype. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compute IBR curves. Sixty-three percent of HER2(3+) patients (113/178) were classified into the Residual Risk subtype. These patients had significantly higher 10-year rates of IBR compared to the nonresidual risk group (16.2% vs. 1.6%, P = .01). The Residual Risk subtype had more nuclear grade 3 disease (87% vs. 63%, P < .001), but age, size, and grade were not associated with IBR rate (P = NS) on univariate and multivariable analysis. Only the Residual Risk group was associated with IBR (P = .05) in multivariate analysis. The 7-gene biosignature with RRt identified a subset of HER2(3+) patients with greater IBR rates following BCS and RT beyond traditional clinical and pathologic features. Consideration of therapies to reduce these elevated IBR rates should be evaluated, including the incorporation of HER2-targeted therapy.",

We report the real-world clinical effectiveness and toxicity data of SG in patients with mTNBC. A multi-institution retrospective study of patients with mTNBC treated with SG from January 2021 to May 2023 was conducted. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used for survival analysis. A total of 115 patients were included. The median age at SG initiation was 60 years (range, 31-85). All patients were female; 73 (63.5%) were White and 31 (27.0%) were Black. The median number of previous therapies in the metastatic setting was two (range, 0-8). Sixty-one (56.0%) patients had primary refractory disease. Median relative dose intensity was 92% (range, 33%-100%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were seen in 50.9% of patients, which included neutropenia (35.7%), anemia (27.0%), vomiting (16.5%), fatigue (8.7%), and diarrhea (7.0%). Dose reductions and treatment discontinuation due to AEs were required in 51.3% and 13.2%, respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) was 27.8%. Median overall survival was 9.6 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 12.9) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 5.9).

In a real-world cohort of heavily pretreated patients with mTNBC, SG retains its clinical activity. In a subgroup with HER2-low disease, T-DXd continues to demonstrate promising clinical activity after SG, supporting the use of sequential antibody-drug conjugates in this population.",

Our main goal was to examine the clinical outcomes and immune markers of patients who received trastuzumab and chemotherapy treatment. Between 1995 and 2012, a total of 98 patients diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed at Ege University Hospital and Tepecik Training and Research Hospital. The clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of the patients were assessed, and the associations between response rates, survival and the immune profiles of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were statistically evaluated. The average age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 50.1\u00b110.3 (ranging from 30 to 79) years. The mean follow-up period for all patients was 97.9\u00b153.8 months. Among the patients, complete response was observed in 24.5%, partial response in 61.2%, and stable disease in 8.2% of cases. The average progression-free survival was 50.3\u00b126.9 months (ranging from 1 to 163 months), and the average overall survival was 88.8\u00b159.4 months (ranging from 12 to 272 months). After analyzing all cases, it was found that patients who were younger (p=0.006), exhibited higher CD3-positivity (p=0.041), presented with higher FOXP3-positivity (p=0.025), showed complete or at least partial response to treatment (p=0.008), and experienced a long-term response to trastuzumab (and chemotherapy) treatment had longer survival (p=0.001).

The mAb trastuzumab is crucial in treating this disease, significantly improving survival outcomes. Despite its inclusion in the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines, access to trastuzumab remains limited worldwide. In this issue of the journal, Norris and colleagues report that only 45% of eligible patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in the United Kingdom received trastuzumab between 2012 and 2017. This finding in a high-income country with universal health care is worrisome and points toward even greater barriers to access in developing nations. Some solutions to improve accessibility, which we discuss, include shorter durations of trastuzumab treatment and encouraging the registration and availability of biosimilars. The data presented by Norris and colleagues point toward a disconnect between the academic oncology landscape, focused on expensive drugs with marginal benefits, and everyday practice in which even essential interventions may not be available. Ensuring the accessibility to proven, essential medicines should be as relevant as innovation to improve patient outcomes and create a more sustainable healthcare system.

    "abstract": "For patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), treatment with pembrolizumab is dependent on the accurate determination of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC). This study evaluated the interobserver concordance in assessing PD-L1 expression on TNBC samples using the commercial 22C3 IHC assay and an in-house assay based on the E1L3N antibody. Concordance between the 22C3 and the E1L3N IHC assays was evaluated on TNBC samples read by a commercial laboratory and a Brigham and Women's Hospital breast pathologist (BWH reader). Each slide was given a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) and was considered PD-L1 positive or negative based on the CPS cutoff of 10. Interobserver concordance for the assays was also evaluated on a subset of samples between 2 and 3 independent readers. On 71 samples, 2 independent readers (1 BWH reader and commercial laboratory) using E1L3N and 22C3, respectively, reached agreement on PD-L1 status (positive/negative) on 64 samples (90.1%). Using 22C3, 2 independent readers reached agreement on PD-L1 status on 30 of 36 samples (83.3%), and 3 independent readers reached agreement on 16 of 27 samples (59.3%). Using E1L3N, 2 BWH readers reached agreement on PD-L1 status on 18 of 27 samples (66.7%). Three BWH readers reached an agreement on 2 of 12 of the most challenging samples (16.7%). In conclusion, concordance between E1L3N and 22C3 testing using CPS for PD-L1 in metastatic TNBC was >90%. However, certain cases were challenging to agree upon using current threshold criteria, highlighting the need for more standardized evidence-based methods to assess PD-L1 expression.",

Using Single Extracellular VEsicle Nanoscopy (SEVEN) platform that combines affinity isolation of EVs with super-resolution microscopy, here we provide multiparametric characterization of EVs with ~\u20098\u00a0nm precision and molecular sensitivity. We first interrogated cell culture EVs affinity-enriched in tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81; these transmembrane proteins are commonly found on EV membranes. SEVEN robustly provided critical parameters of individual, tetraspanin-enriched EVs: concentration, size, shape, molecular cargo content, and heterogeneity. Trastuzumab-resistant cells (vs. trastuzumab-sensitive) secreted more EVs. Additionally, EVs from trastuzumab-resistant cells had lower tetraspanin density and higher HER2 density. We also evaluated EVs affinity-enriched in HER2; we found that these EVs (vs. tetraspanin-enriched) were larger and more elongated. We further optimized analytical sample processing to assess a rare population of HER2-enriched EVs from patient plasma. In breast cancer patients with elevated HER2 protein expression (vs. controls), HER2-enriched EVs had distinct characteristics including typically increased number of tetraspanin molecules and larger size. Importantly, these EVs were on average 25-fold more abundant compared to no cancer controls. SEVEN revealed unique characteristics of HER2-enriched EVs in cultured cells and complex biological fluid. In combination with current clinical approaches, this method is well poised to support precise therapeutic decisions.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoural oncolytic virotherapy may have promise as a means to debulk and downstage inoperable tumours in preparation for successful surgery. Here, we describe the unique case of a 50-year-old self-experimenting female virologist with locally recurrent muscle-invasive breast cancer who was able to proceed to simple, non-invasive tumour resection after receiving multiple intratumoural injections of research-grade virus preparations, which first included an Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine strain (MeV) and then a vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana strain (VSV), both prepared in her own laboratory. The intratumoural virus therapy was well tolerated. Frequent imaging studies and regular clinical observations documenting size, consistency and mobility of the injected tumour demonstrate that both the MeV- and VSV-containing parts of the protocol contributed to the overall favourable response. Two months after the start of the virus injections, the shrunken tumour was no longer invading the skin or underlying muscle and was surgically excised. The excised tumour showed strong lymphocytic infiltration, with an increase in CD20-positive B cells, CD8-positive T cells and macrophages. PD-L1 expression was detected in contrast to the baseline PD-L1-negative phenotype. The patient completed one-year trastuzumab adjuvant therapy and remains well and recurrence-free 45 months post-surgery. Although an isolated case, it encourages consideration of oncolytic virotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment modality.",

    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer metastasis remains the primary cause of mortality among women globally. Targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment efficacy, with Trastuzumab (Trast), a monoclonal antibody, targeting HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. The tumor-homing peptide iRGD enhances the intratumoral accumulation and penetration of therapeutic agents. Liposomes serve as versatile nanocarriers for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Gefitinib (GFB) is a potential anticancer drug against HER2-positive breast cancer, while Lycorine hydrochloride (LCH) is a natural compound with anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. This study developed TPGS-COOH-coated liposomes co-loaded with GFB and LCH, prepared by the solvent injection method, and surface-functionalized with Trast and iRGD. The dual surface-decorated liposomes (DSDLs) were characterized for their particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), surface chemistry, surface morphology, and their crystallinity during in-vitro drug release, drug encapsulation, and in-vitro cell line studies on SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC-50) values of single decorated liposomes (SDLs), iRGD-LP, and Trast-LP, as well as DSDLs (iRGD-Trast-LP) on SK-BR-3 cells, were 6.10 \u00b1 0.42, 4.98 \u00b1 0.36, and 4.34 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the IC-50 values of SDLs and DSDLs on MDA-MB-231 cells were 15.12 \u00b1 0.68, 13.09 \u00b1 0.59, and 11.08 \u00b1 0.48 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Cellular uptake studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that iRGD and Trast functionalization significantly enhanced cellular uptake in both cell lines. The wound-healing assay demonstrated a significant reduction in SDL and DSDL-treated MDA-MB-231 cell migration compared to the control. Additionally, the blood compatibility study showed minimal hemolysis (less than 5% RBC lysis), indicating good biocompatibility and biosafety. Overall, these findings suggest that TPGS-COOH-coated, GFB and LCH co-loaded, dual-ligand (iRGD and Trast) functionalized, multifunctional liposomes could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

In the present study, we assessed the impact of chemotherapy on cardiovascular function by assessing the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), global longitudinal strain (GLS) and ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC: CAVI/GLS ratio) in chemotherapy-treated women. This prospective study enrolled 78 women with breast cancer who were receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy +/- anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab +/- pertuzumab). Forty-one age-matched healthy women served as controls. We comparatively evaluated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), CAVI, GLS and VAC, between the chemotherapy and control groups. We also assessed their changes over time (baseline, 3-month and 6-month time point) and their independent association with the incidence of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular dysfunction (CTRCD) in the chemotherapy group. In comparison to healthy controls, women receiving chemotherapy presented with significantly higher GLS (from -21.02 \u00b1 2.09% to -19.01 \u00b1 2.81%,  Women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy displayed abnormal levels of CAVI, VAC and GLS, compared to healthy individuals. Those effects on VAC and CAVI were more exaggerated among women with CTRCD, implicating their potential use to refine screening and therapeutic strategies for this specific population.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody which works against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), possibly causes cardiotoxicity through mitochondrial dysfunction. The usefulness of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the assessment of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity remains uncertain. This study aimed to determine the temporal changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cell death in the isolated PBMCs of HER2-positive breast cancer patients during breast cancer treatment and to compare the changes with HER2-negative breast cancer patients who did not receive trastuzumab therapy. Eighteen newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer women who received sequential doxorubicin and trastuzumab were consecutively recruited. Age- and gender-matched controls with HER2-negative breast cancer were selected. Echocardiography was carried out, and blood samples for the study of cardiac biomarkers and PBMCs were collected periodically during treatment. Only one patient in our cohort developed asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction during trastuzumab treatment. However, trastuzumab following doxorubicin aggravated subclinical cardiac injury, determined by cardiac troponin and echocardiography. Cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress in isolated PBMCs remained unchanged throughout breast cancer treatment. Regarding mitochondrial respiration, the maximal respiration and spare respiration capacity was significantly increased in controls after doxorubicin treatment but not in patients who received trastuzumab therapy. Moreover, the percentage of apoptosis and necroptosis in isolated PBMCs was dramatically decreased in the control, compared to patients with trastuzumab treatment. In conclusion, trastuzumab caused subtle myocardial injury and impaired mitochondrial respiration and cell viability in isolated PBMCs.",

    "title": "Shifting the Paradigm: The Transformative Role of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "The use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has become increasingly important in the treatment of breast cancer because of its various advantages. These include the ability to downstage tumors without compromising locoregional control and the potential to obtain valuable information about clinical and biological response to therapy with implications for individual prognoses. Surgical response assessment paves the way for response-adapted therapy, and pathological complete response (pCR; defined as ypT0/is ypN0) serves as an additional endpoint for drug development trials. Recommended NST regimens commonly consist of anthracyclines and taxane, with dose-dense anthracyclines and weekly paclitaxel often preferred, whenever feasible. For patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive tumors, dual anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) is indicated together with NST in case of elevated risk of recurrence. For patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), adding carboplatin to NST correlates with improved pCR and survival rates, as does the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors. For hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative cancers, emerging data on NST including immune checkpoint inhibitors may elevate the significance of NST in high-risk luminal breast cancer. Here, we present a synthesis of the results from neoadjuvant clinical trials that aim at optimizing treatment options for patients with high-risk breast cancer.",

Targeted therapies like trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1 have revolutionized HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment. Although these therapies have improved MBC management and patient outcomes, resistance can develop, reducing effectiveness. Personalized strategies based on tumor characteristics offer hope for better responses and longer outcomes. This review outlines insights into MBC patients responding well to anti-HER2 treatments, even across multiple treatment regimen. Recent immunotherapy, locoregional therapy, and liquid biopsy breakthroughs are covered, suggesting ways to increase long-term responders. Personalized approaches have boosted HER2-positive MBC outcomes, and ongoing research is crucial to uncover new treatments and biomarkers, potentially elevating long-term response rates and prognoses.

This case report details the clinical journey of a 21-year-old female diagnosed with Grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, which was estrogen receptor low positive and progesterone receptor negative but positive for Her2 (3+) with a high Ki67 proliferation index. Genetic testing confirmed a TP53 mutation, establishing the diagnosis of LFS. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TCHP (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab), resulting in a complete clinical response. This was followed by bilateral skin-sparing and nipple-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and immediate reconstruction. Postoperative pathology confirmed a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. The patient's treatment plan includes 12\u00a0cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, with regular echocardiograms to monitor cardiac function and fertility preservation strategies involving monthly Lupron injections. Given the association of LFS with a high risk of multiple primary cancers, a rigorous surveillance strategy is essential. The psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis and the burden of living with a hereditary cancer syndrome were significant, necessitating comprehensive psychosocial support. Managing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and its associated cancers, particularly in young patients, necessitates a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach. Early genetic testing for TP53 mutations is crucial in identifying LFS, enabling personalized treatment plans and proactive surveillance strategies.",

The most common side effects are fatigue, diarrhoea, anaemia, transaminase elevation and drug-induced thrombocytopenia. This report describes a patient with metastatic breast cancer who developed drug-induced lupus due to T-DM1. A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2018. She underwent modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (pT2N1aM0). Following supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in May 2018, she received 8 cycles of docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. In December 2020, the patient presented with axillary and intra-abdominal lymph node metastases, along with bone metastases observed on PET/CT scan. Treatment with T-DM1 and zoledronic acid was initiated. After 18 months on T-DM1, she developed drug-induced lupus. Her symptoms resolved with hydroxychloroquine treatment and discontinuation of T-DM1. Drug-induced lupus is a clinical syndrome that shares similar features with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The majority of patients present with symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia. Hydralazine and procainamide are high-risk drugs for drug-induced lupus. Symptoms usually develop after months or years of use, but may also develop suddenly. Our patient also received TDM-1 treatment for 18 months. We present a case of TDM-1-associated drug-induced lupus in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. This is the first case of TDM-1-related drug-induced lupus reported in the literature.",

We analyzed serial breast MRIs in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy on the I-SPY2 clinical trial. Patients with stage 2-3 HER2-negative breast cancer were randomized to weekly paclitaxel (control), weekly paclitaxel and pembrolizumab, or weekly paclitaxel, pembrolizumab and intra-tumoral injection of SD-101, a TLR9 agonist. All patients received AC. Regional lymph nodes were retrospectively evaluated on breast MRI at baseline, 3, 12 and 20 weeks by a single blinded radiologist. MRIs were assessed for development of new regional lymphadenopathy, or increase in the longest diameter or cortical thickness of the largest abnormal regional lymph node.

For this prospective multicenter clinical study, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients with PAM pathway mutations confirmed by histology or peripheral blood genetic testing were enrolled from July 2021 to September 2022. Patients were randomly assigned to a trial or control group. The patients in the trial group received inetetamab combined with sirolimus and chemotherapy, while the control group patients received pyrotinib and chemotherapy. The RECIST v1.1 standard was used to evaluate efficacy. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the clinicopathological features, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves. The log-rank test was used to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. A total of 59 HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients with abnormal activation of the PAM pathway were included, of which 37 received inetetamab combined with sirolimus and chemotherapy treatment and 22 received pyrotinib and chemotherapy treatment. The median PFS was 4.64 months in the inetetamab group and 5.69 months in the pyrotinib group, with no statistically significant difference ( For metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients with abnormal PAM pathway activation and previous trastuzumab treatment, the combination of inetetamab with sirolimus and chemotherapy is equivalent to the combination of pyrotinib and chemotherapy. Therefore, this regimen could be a treatment option for PAM pathway-activated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy, has demonstrated durable anticancer activity in patients with advanced, metastatic HER2 (also known as ERBB2)-mutant (HER2m) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. To analytically validate and assess the clinical utility of the Oncomine Dx Target (ODxT) Test as a companion diagnostic to identify patients with HER2m NSCLC. Tumor samples from patients in DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02 were retrospectively analyzed alongside commercially procured samples using the ODxT test and compared to the assays used for screening in these clinical trials. Positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) between the ODxT Test and TruSight Tumor 170 assay when testing DESTINY-Lung01 and commercially procured samples met prespecified thresholds (PPA and NPA \u226590%) for analytical accuracy (100% and 99.1%). The ODxT Test results were highly concordant with clinical trial assays (CTAs) used in DESTINY-Lung01 (PPA and NPA, 98.0% and 100%) and DESTINY-Lung02 (PPA and NPA, 96.7% and 100%) to identify activating HER2 mutations in tumor samples. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between patients with HER2m tumors identified by the ODxT Test and by CTAs in DESTINY-Lung01 (58.3% and 54.9%) and DESTINY-Lung02 (53.6% and 53.8%). Response duration was 12.0 and 9.3 months for patients identified by the ODxT Test and CTAs, respectively, in DESTINY-Lung01. The ODxT Test detected HER2 mutations in NSCLC with high analytical and clinical accuracy and identified HER2m populations with response rates similar to populations identified by CTAs, supporting clinical utility of the ODxT Test to inform treatment decisions for HER2m NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "To assess safety and immune biomarkers after preoperative radiation therapy (RT) and anti-PD1 therapy in breast cancer. A phase I/IIb trial of pembrolizumab with RT was conducted in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer. All received pembrolizumab followed by a second cycle + RT (anti-PD1/RT) of 24 Gy/three daily fractions delivered to the breast tumor and then neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Blood and tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline, after anti-PD1, and after anti-PD-RT. Coprimary end points were safety and change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Secondary end points were pathologic complete response (pCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) rates, and event-free survival (EFS). Sixty-six patients with stage I-III breast cancer (54 TNBC, 12 HR+/HER2-) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 32 months. Safety end point was met. Incidence of grade \u22653 toxicities was 41%. The pCR rate was 59.2%, 33.3%, and 54.5% for the TNBC, HR+/HER2-, and entire cohort, respectively. A total of 77.8% of TNBC and 41.6% of HR+/HER2- had a near pCR (RCB 0-1). The 3-year EFS was 80%. In the entire cohort, PD-L1 expression increased after anti-PD1 (median Combined Positive Score [CPS], 7.49-23.20; 95% CI, -41.88 to -6.30;  Preoperative RT with pembrolizumab is safe and results in high pCR rates and 3-year EFS, despite the lack of pembrolizumab during NAC.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Occult breast cancer (OBC) is diagnosed when regional or distant metastases are found without evidence of a primary tumor. The low overall incidence is a great challenge for the management strategy of OBC. Aggressive diagnosis and personalized treatment are feasible treatment strategies for OBC. We report the case of an OBC patient who achieved pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital 6 months after detecting a lump in her left axilla, about the size of a quail egg, but not red or swollen, and the lump gradually grew. Mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a visible left axilla lesion but no nodules in bilateral breasts. A core-needle biopsy of the axilla lesion revealed an invasive carcinoma of breast origin. The tumor cells were estrogen receptors (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and HER2-positive (3+) by immunohistochemistry. The patient was finally diagnosed with HER2-positive, hormone receptor-negative occult breast cancer of the left breast, cT0N2M0, stage IIIA. The TCbHP regimen (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given. She underwent a modified radical mastectomy, showing a pCR. Subsequent radiotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy were administrated. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights that even aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer can present as an occult primary tumor. Our clinical experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy can be effective for treating such rare cases. The patient achieved pCR, which can provide a therapeutic strategy for effective treatment of similar OBCs.",

    "abstract": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported adjuvant trastuzumab-based treatment improved overall survival (OS) among patients with HER2-positive early invasive breast cancer (EIBC). Few RCTs included older patients or those with comorbidity/frailty. This study aimed to determine whether the effect of adjuvant trastuzumab-based treatment on survival outcomes varies by patient age and fitness, using national data from routine care. Women (50+ years) newly-diagnosed with HER2-positive EIBC between 2014 and 2019 were identified from England Cancer Registry data. Registration records were linked to Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy data for treatment details and ONS death register for mortality details. A propensity score analysis employing the inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to balance the patient variables across treatment groups. Cox models were used to evaluate whether the effect of treatment on OS was associated with patient age and fitness; competing risks regression models were used for breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). 5238 women initiated adjuvant trastuzumab-based treatment. Median follow-up was 56.7 months. Comparison with 3421 women who did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab highlighted differences at diagnosis in relation to age, fitness, grade, nodal involvement, surgery type and use of radiotherapy. Weighted survival analysis found trastuzumab was associated with improved OS (hazard ratio HR 0.56, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.45-0.70) and improved BCSS (subHR 0.62, 95\u00a0%CI: 0.47-0.82). We found no evidence of a difference in effect by age or patient fitness for either outcome. In this national dataset, adjuvant trastuzumab was associated with improvements in survival, with an OS effect size similar to RCT evidence. The effect size was not found to vary by patient age or fitness. Chronological age and fitness alone should not be barriers to receipt of effective adjuvant targeted treatment.",

Among their uses, from several years, they have been available in Europe for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, as an alternative to Herceptin\u00ae. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the available literature with particular focus on phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing adverse events between trastuzumab biosimilar and originator. A systematic review was conducted in Pubmed and Scopus to include all phase 3 RCTs related to trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and published up to July 31, 2023. Of the 508 records identified, 14 articles were meta-analyzed for safety information, including serious treatment emergent adverse events, death-related adverse events, neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, increased ALT, increased AST, anti-drug antibody, and neutralizing antibody. Included patients had an early breast cancer (N=2,877) or a metastatic breast cancer (N=2,603). No significant difference in death-related adverse events was found for trastuzumab biosimilar and originator when evaluated for an early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant phase (Risk Ratio [RR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-3.59; I2 = 0%; p = 0.57) and overall (RR, 0.43; 95%CI, 0.11-1.66; I2 = 20%; p = 0.26), and for metastatic breast cancer (RR, 0.61; 95%CI, 0.30-1.26; I2 = 0%; p = 0.85). No difference was also observed for all other safety outcomes as in accordance with clinical studies necessary for the registration and approval of a biosimilar at a European level.",

It also explores the role of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and its biosimilar as targeted therapies for HER2-positive breast cancer in long-term treatment. A 54-year-old postmenopausal female patient with recurrent breast cancer and metastasis was treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel (12 cycles), followed by trastuzumab maintenance therapy (71 cycles). She received radiation therapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions after presenting with bleeding from the breast lesion. Oral therapy with lapatinib and letrozole was prescribed for a year to treat the breast cancer, along with the lesions and enhanced nodules observed in the patient's lungs, liver, and bones. A year later, she presented with complaints of seizures and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with brain metastasis. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was administered after performing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). The WBRT was followed by trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) biosimilar therapy. Currently, the patient has received more than 30 cycles of T-DM1 and has survived while maintaining a good quality of life. The patient has survived 7.5 years in a stable disease condition after the detection of recurrent breast cancer with metastasis to the liver, lungs, bones, and brain. This case report demonstrates the long-term efficacy of T-DM1 and its satisfactory safety profile. Overall, it provides valuable insights into the management of and challenges faced during the treatment of recurrent breast cancer with metastasis.",

    "abstract": "At the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-671 trial, adding perioperative pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved event-free survival in participants with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report overall survival and health-related quality of life outcomes from the second interim analysis. KEYNOTE-671 was a global phase 3 trial done at 189 medical centres. Eligible participants (aged \u226518 years) with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2) NSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to four cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and 13 cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) or to four cycles of neoadjuvant placebo (administered intravenously every 3 weeks) plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and 13 cycles of adjuvant placebo (administered intravenously every 3 weeks). Randomisation was done centrally using an interactive response technology system and was stratified by disease stage, PD-L1 expression, histology, and geographical region in blocks of four. Participants, investigators, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment assignments; local pharmacists were unmasked to support treatment preparation. The dual primary endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival evaluated in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between May 11, 2018, and Dec 15, 2021, 797 participants were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab group (n=397) or the placebo group (n=400). Median study follow-up at the second interim analysis was 36\u00b76 months (IQR 27\u00b76-47\u00b78). 36-month overall survival estimates were 71% (95% CI 66-76) in the pembrolizumab group and 64% (58-69) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b772 [95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b793]; one-sided p=0\u00b70052; threshold, one-sided p=0\u00b70054). Median event-free survival was 47\u00b72 months (95% CI 32\u00b79 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group and 18\u00b73 months (14\u00b78-22\u00b71) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0\u00b759 [95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b772]). In the as-treated population, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 179 (45%) of 396 participants in the pembrolizumab group and in 151 (38%) of 399 participants in the placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (1%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and three (1%) participants in the placebo group. The significant overall survival benefit of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone coupled with a manageable safety profile support the use of perioperative pembrolizumab in patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC.

    "abstract": "The increasing use and anticipated future adoption of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) present a significant challenge in identifying and monitoring patients for the development of potentially fatal drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). We sought to apply a tissue-specific methylation analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to measure lung damage in patients with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)-related ILD. We describe a patient with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive endometrial cancer who developed ILD during T-DXd treatment. Blood samples collected at the time of ILD diagnosis, after recovery, and following rechallenge were studied for lung damage using lung-specific methylation markers in cfDNA. To validate the findings, we also tested plasma samples from an additional cohort of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with T-DXd. In patients with HER2-positive metastatic cancer treated with T-DXd, the presence of an active ILD, as assessed clinically and using chest computed tomography, was associated with increased levels of lung-derived cfDNA. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that liquid biopsy can be developed as a valuable tool for detecting and monitoring ADC-related ILD. Its low cost and simplicity make it a potential alternative to current imaging methods, warranting further clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common adverse events associated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). We evaluated the efficacy of an olanzapine-based triplet regimen for preventing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving their first cycle T-DXd. This multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (ERICA) phase II study enrolled patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low metastatic breast cancer receiving their first cycle of T-DXd. Patients were randomized to olanzapine 5 mg or placebo once daily (1 : 1 ratio) from day 1 to day 6, plus a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone 6.6 mg intravenously or 8 mg orally on day 1. The total observation period was 504 h (21 days) from the first T-DXd administration. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR), defined as no emetic events and no rescue medications, in the delayed phase (24-120 h after T-DXd), with the type I error rate of 0.2 (one-sided) for the comparison. Secondary endpoints included no nausea rate in the delayed and persistent phases (120-504 h), adverse event by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and patient-reported outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). In total, 168 patients were enrolled at 43 sites in Japan (November 2021-September 2023) with 162 patients (olanzapine, n\u00a0= 80; placebo, n\u00a0= 82) included in the per protocol set. The primary endpoint was met as the delayed phase CR rate was significantly greater with olanzapine than placebo (70.0% versus 56.1%, P\u00a0= 0.047). Efficacy was maintained in the persistent phase (63.9% versus 44.4%). No nausea rate was also greater with olanzapine (delayed phase: 57.5% versus 37.8%; persistent phase: 51.4% versus 31.9%). CR rates in the delayed phase favored olanzapine across subgroups. Appetite loss was also decreased with olanzapine. Hyperglycemia and somnolence were mostly of low-grade severity. Olanzapine 5 mg for 6 days with 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone appears effective for T-DXd-treated patients to prevent delayed and persistent nausea and vomiting.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer worsen after one or more lines of endocrine-based therapy. Trastuzumab deruxtecan has shown efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer with low expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) after previous chemotherapy. We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial involving patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression (a score of 1+ or 2+ on immunohistochemical [IHC] analysis and negative results on in situ hybridization) or ultralow HER2 expression (IHC 0 with membrane staining) who had received one or more lines of endocrine-based therapy and no previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or the physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (according to blinded independent central review) among the patients with HER2-low disease. Secondary end points included progression-free survival among all the patients who had undergone randomization, overall survival, and safety. Of the 866 patients who underwent randomization, 713 had HER2-low disease, and 153 had HER2-ultralow disease. Among the patients with HER2-low disease, the median progression-free survival was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.4 to 15.2) in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 8.1 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 9.0) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001); the results were consistent in the exploratory HER2-ultralow population. Data for overall survival were immature. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 52.8% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and in 44.4% of those in the chemotherapy group. Adjudicated interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 49 patients (11.3%; three events were grade 5 in severity) and in 1 patient (0.2%; grade 2), respectively. Among patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-low or HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer who had received one or more lines of endocrine-based therapy, treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy. No new safety signals were identified. (Funded by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo; DESTINY-Breast06 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04494425.).",

    "abstract": "Currently, therapy for early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) is based on the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant regimen. The INMUNOHER study aimed to detect immunological markers in peripheral blood and their association with treatment response. Sixty-two HER2+ BC patients were recruited. Pre-treatment samples were obtained before the start of treatment, while post-treatment samples were obtained after completing therapy and before surgery and were analyzed by flow cytometry. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate achieved was 82.3%. The expression of the NKp30, PD-1, and TIM-3 receptors was reduced in the Natural Killer (NK)-CD56dim subset of patients who did not achieve pCR. Following therapy, many changes were found in leukocytes, including alterations in T cell lymphocyte proportions. Also, the percentage of NK cells decreased, and several phenotypic changes were observed in this population. After treatment, IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells against HER2+-cells with or without trastuzumab was significantly reduced. HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy demonstrated high efficacy in most patients, reducing the statistical power for finding immunological markers. However, NK subset phenotypes correlated better with response groups, and numerous changes in the percentage of leukocytes and T and NK cells, as well as changes in the functionality of NK cells, were observed in most patients after treatment, encouraging further research into these immune populations.",

    "title": "A Non-Canonical p75HER2 Signaling Pathway Underlying Trastuzumab Action and Resistance in Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Overexpression of HER2 occurs in 25% of breast cancer. Targeting HER2 has proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive breast cancer. While trastuzumab is the most commonly used HER2 targeting agent, which has significantly improved outcomes, the overall response rate is low. To develop novel therapies to boost trastuzumab efficacy, it is critical to identify the mechanisms underlying trastuzumab action and resistance. We recently showed that the inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by trastuzumab is not through the inhibition of HER2 canonical signaling. Here we report the identification of a novel non-canonical HER2 signaling pathway and its interference by trastuzumab. We showed that HER2 signaled through a non-canonical pathway, regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). In this pathway, HER2 is first cleaved by metalloprotease ADAM10 to produce an extracellular domain (ECD) that is released and the p95HER2 that contains the transmembrane domain (TM) and intracellular domain (ICD). p95HER2, if further cleaved by an intramembrane protease, \u03b3-secretase, produced a soluble ICD p75HER2 with nuclear localization signal (NLS). p75HER2 is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus. Nuclear p75HER2 promotes cell proliferation. Trastuzumab targets this non-canonical HER2 pathway via inhibition of the proteolytic cleavage of HER2 by both ADAM10 and \u03b3-secretase. However, p75HER2 pathway also confers resistance to trastuzumab once aberrantly activated. Combination of trastuzumab with ADAM10 and \u03b3-secretase inhibitors completely blocks p75HER2 production in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells. We concluded that HER2 signals through the RIP signaling pathway that promotes cell proliferation and is targeted by trastuzumab. The aberrant HER2 RIP signaling confers resistance to trastuzumab that could be overcome by the application of inhibitors to ADAM10 and \u03b3-secretase.",

Here, we investigated the effect of germline HLA-I/-II on clinical outcomes among NSCLC patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. We prospectively recruited patients with NSCLC who were commencing first-line pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. DNA from white blood cells was used for high-resolution HLA-I/II typing. Of the 65 patients recruited, 53 complied with the inclusion criteria. We did not find an association between HLA-I/-II homozygosity and clinical outcome among the studied population. However, the presence of HLA-A01 was associated with unfavourable PFS (HR = 2.32, 95%CI 1.13-4.77,  The absence of association between genomic HLA-I/-II homozygosity and clinical outcome among patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy might reflect a diminished role for HLA molecules among patients with low or no PD-L1.

    "abstract": "We report 5-year efficacy and safety outcomes from CheckMate 9LA in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) and exploratory analyses in key patient subgroups. Adults with stage IV/recurrent NSCLC and no sensitizing EGFR/ALK alterations were randomized to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy (n\u202f=\u202f361) or chemotherapy (n\u202f=\u202f358). Outcomes were assessed in all randomized patients and subgroups. With 57.3 months' minimum follow-up, patients continued to derive overall survival (OS) benefit with nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.85; 5-year OS rates, 18% vs. 11%), regardless of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (PD-L1\u202f< 1%, 22% vs. 8%; PD-L1\u202f\u2265 1%, 18% vs. 11%), histology (squamous, 18% vs. 7%; non-squamous, 19% vs. 12%), or presence of baseline brain metastases (20% vs. 6%). Five-year duration of response (DOR) rates were 19% versus 8% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, with consistent benefit across subgroups. Patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy due to treatment-related adverse events had a 5-year OS rate of 37%. Five-year progression-free survival and DOR rates in 5-year survivors were 55% versus 38% and 59% versus 46%, respectively. No new safety signals were observed in 5-year survivors, regardless of the number of ipilimumab doses received. This 5-year update supports the long-term, durable OS benefit and improved 5-year survivorship with nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy in patients with mNSCLC, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression or histology.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has shown remarkable intracranial and extracranial activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and HER2-low advanced breast cancer (ABC). The DEBBRAH trial was designed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low ABC with a history of brain metastases (BMs) and/or LMD. Here, we report results from cohort 5, which specifically included patients with pathologically confirmed LMD. This single-arm, open-label, five-cohort, phase 2 trial enrolled seven patients in cohort 5 who received 5.4\u00a0mg/kg T-DXd intravenously every 21\u00a0days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety profile. At data cutoff (April 4, 2023), the median duration of follow-up was 12.0\u00a0months (range, 2.5-18.6). The median OS was 13.3\u00a0months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-NA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), meeting the primary endpoint. The median PFS was 8.9\u00a0months (95% CI, 2.1-NA). Two (28.6%) of seven patients remained on treatment after 18.6 and 11.9\u00a0months, respectively. Of the five patients who progressed and died, none had intracranial progression or clinical worsening of leptomeningeal symptoms. Notably, 71.4% (95% CI, 29.0-96.3) achieved prolonged stabilization (\u226524\u00a0weeks) by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v.1.1. No unexpected safety signals and no treatment-related deaths were observed. T-DXd showed promising antitumor activity in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low ABC with previously untreated, pathologically confirmed LMD.

    "abstract": "The evolution of systemic therapies has improved outcomes for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Nonetheless, the tolerability and safety profile of systemic therapies represent an area for further improvement. Here we report the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating a nonanthracycline, nonplatinum adjuvant treatment regimen for patients following initial surgical resection. We enrolled patients with stage I or II HER2+ breast cancer who underwent upfront surgery to receive adjuvant treatment with 6 cycles of dose-dense Paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide and Trastuzumab (PC-H) every 2 weeks, followed by 13 cycles of maintenance trastuzumab every 3 weeks to complete 52 weeks of treatment (compromising 19 cycles). The primary objective was to determine the safety and feasibility of adjuvant PC-H, measured by the completion rate frequency and the grade of adverse events, using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria. The secondary objective was to estimate relapse-free survival and overall survival. Between 2010 and 2019, a total of 39 patients were enrolled. Of those, 34 patients (87.18%) completed the planned treatment. Severe adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 27 patients (69.23%), including 3 patients (7.69%) with grade 3-4 decrease in ejection fraction. At median follow up of 5.6 years, all 39 patients were alive. The 5-year relapse-free survival was 94.30% (95% CI: 75.3-100). PC-H demonstrated overall safety and efficacy, yielding high rates of relapse-free survival among patients with early stage (HER2+) breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among females with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), but available data on LFS-related BC characteristics are derived from small retrospective cohorts. Prior work has demonstrated a high proportion of HER2-positive BCs, but our understanding of how HER2-positive LFS BCs respond to anti-HER2 treatments is limited. BCs diagnosed in patients with germline TP53 variants between 2002-2022 were assembled from three institutions. Hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 expression were retrieved from pathology records. Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as ypT0/is ypN0. A total of 264 BCs were identified among 232 patients with LFS: 211 (79.9\u00a0%) were invasive carcinomas, of which 106 were HER2-positive. Among HER2-positive BCs, most tumors co-expressed HRs (72.6\u00a0%) and were more frequent among those diagnosed at younger age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Mastectomy was the preferred surgical approach among women with nonmetastatic cancers (77.8\u00a0%) and most received anti-HER2 targeted therapy (74.7\u00a0%). Among 38 patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy with available post-treatment pathology reports, 27 (71.1\u00a0%) achieved pCR: 18/26 (69.2\u00a0%) among HR-positive and 7/10 (70.0\u00a0%) HR-negative. The rate of pCR was 84.6\u00a0% among patients treated with an anthracycline-free regimen (all received trastuzumab). Among classifiable HER2-negative BCs (n\u00a0=\u00a077), 31 (40.3\u00a0%) were HER2-low and 46 (59.7\u00a0%) HER2-zero. Among females with LFS and BC, HER2-positive subtype was associated with younger age at diagnosis and a predominant HR-positivity. Favorable pCR rates were observed among those receiving neoadjuvant HER2-directed therapies, for both HR-positive and negative tumors. These data may inform the counseling and care of patients with LFS.",

    "title": "Echocardiographic Functional Outcomes Following Regional Nodal Irradiation for Breast Cancer Using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for breast cancer yields improvements in disease outcomes, yet comprehensive target coverage often increases cardiac radiation therapy (RT) dose. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) may mitigate high-dose cardiac exposure, although it often increases the volume of low-dose exposure. The cardiac implications of this dosimetric configuration (in contrast to historic 3D conformal techniques) remain uncertain. Eligible patients receiving adjuvant RNI using VMAT for locoregional breast cancer were prospectively enrolled in an IRB-approved study. Echocardiograms were performed prior to RT, at the conclusion of RT, and 6 months following RT. Echocardiographic parameters were measured by a single reader and measures were compared pre- and post-RT via the signed-rank test. Changes in echocardiographic parameters over time were compared to mean and max heart doses via the Spearman correlation test. Among 19 evaluable patients (median age 38 years), 89% (n = 17) received doxorubicin and 37% (n = 7) received trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination therapy. All patients received VMAT-based whole-breast/chest wall and RNI. The average mean heart dose was 456 cGy (range, 187-697 cGy) and the average max heart dose was 3001 cGy (1560-4793 cGy). Among salient echocardiographic parameters, no significant decrement in cardiac function was observed when comparing pre-RT to 6 months post-RT: mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 61.8% (SD 4.4%) pre-RT and 62.7% (SD 3.8%) 6 months post-RT ( VMAT for left-sided RNI yielded no significant early decrement in echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function, including LVEF and GLS, within this limited cohort. No patient exhibited significant LVEF changes, and none exhibited sustained decrements in GLS. VMAT may be a reasonable approach to cardiac avoidance in patients requiring RNI, including those receiving anthracyclines and HER2-directed therapy. Larger cohorts with longer follow-ups will be needed to validate these findings.",

Due to its optimized antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect compared with trastuzumab, it has shown good efficacy and safety in the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of inetetamab combination therapy in the treatment of HER2-positive ABC in real-world clinical practice. Retrospective study. A total of 133 patients with HER2-positive ABC who were treated with inetetamab-based regimens between March 2020 and January 2024 were retrospectively included in this study. The main endpoint was median progression-free survival (mPFS). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. The study included 133 HER2-positive ABC patients, and the median age was 55\u2009years. The mPFS was 8.0 (6.7-9.3)\u2009months. The ORR was 50.4%, while the DCR was 88.7%. The mPFS for patients receiving inetetamab-based therapy as first to second, third to fourth, and later lines of metastatic treatment were 14.0, 7.0, and 6.0\u2009months, respectively. Patients treated with inetetamab plus pyrotinib plus chemotherapy, especially with capecitabine, had the best outcomes (mPFS\u2009=\u200914.0\u2009months). Multivariate analysis revealed that prior HER2-TKI treatment was significantly associated with worse PFS (hazard ratios 2.829, 95% confidence interval 1.265-6.328,  Inetetamab-based combination therapy shows promising efficacy and good safety in patients with HER2-positive ABC.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is approved for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and HER2-low advanced breast cancer (ABC). T-DXd has shown encouraging intracranial activity in HER2-positive ABC patients with stable or active brain metastases (BMs); however, its efficacy in patients with HER2-low ABC with BMs is not well established yet. DEBBRAH is a single-arm, five-cohort, phase II study evaluating T-DXd in patients with central nervous system involvement from HER2-positive and HER2-low ABC. Here, we report results from patients with heavily pretreated HER2-low ABC and active BMs, enrolled in cohorts 2 (n\u00a0= 6, asymptomatic untreated BMs) and 4 (n\u00a0= 6, progressing BMs after local therapy). Patients received 5.4 mg/kg T-DXd intravenously once every 21 days. The primary endpoint was intracranial objective response rate per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) for both cohorts. Intracranial objective response rate per RANO-BM was 50.0% [3/6 patients; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.8% to 88.2%] and 33.3% [2/6 patients; 95% CI 4.3% to 77.7%; P\u00a0= 0.033 (one-sided)] in cohorts 2 and 4, respectively. All responders had partial responses. Median time to intracranial response was 2.3 months (range, 1.5-4.0 months) and median duration of intracranial response was 7.2 months (range, 2.8-16.8 months). Median progression-free survival per RECIST v.1.1. was 5.4 months (95% CI 4.1-10.0 months). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in all patients included (16.7% grade 3). Three patients (25.0%) had grade 1 interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis. T-DXd demonstrated promising intracranial activity in pretreated HER2-low ABC patients with active BMs. Further studies are needed to validate these results in larger cohorts.

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) is a new treatment method for resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Network meta-analysis assessed efficacy, safety, and optimal treatment. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NICT with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and international conferences. Outcomes were surgical resection rate, pathological complete response(pCR),event-free survival (EFS), and Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). RCTs of 3,387 patients, six treatment combinations, and two modalities were included. Meta-analysis showed that NICT yielded higher pCR and EFS rates than NCT. The toripalimab-chemotherapy combination had the highest surgical resection rate (OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI: 1.05-2.73), pCR (OR\u2009=\u200938.84, 95% CI: 11.05-268.19) and EFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.40, 95% CI: 0.28-0.58).This regimen worked well for patients with low programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression or squamous cell pathology. For high PD-L1 expression and patients with NSCLC, neoadjuvant nivolumab with chemotherapy had the most efficacy. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events increased with longer treatment cycles, with perioperative nivolumab combined with chemotherapy showing the worst safety profile (RR\u2009=\u20091.32, 95% CI: 1.00-1.76), while neoadjuvant nivolumab combined with chemotherapy alone had the best safety profile (RR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI: 0.68-1.21). Indirect comparison showed no survival benefit for neoadjuvant-adjuvant immunotherapy (HR\u2009=\u20090.93, 95% CI: 0.65-1.35). In the indirect comparison between the two immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs), although there was no significant difference in EFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.81, 95% CI: 0.61-1.08), PD-1 inhibitors may still be the most effective treatment option. NICT effectively and safely treats resectable NSCLC. The optimal treatment combination is typically toripalimab and chemotherapy. Treatment based on PD-L1 expression and pathological type is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in ERBB2 (encoding HER2) occur in 2% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and confer poor prognosis. ERBB-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors, approved for treating other HER2-dependent cancers, are ineffective in HER2-mutant NSCLC due to dose-limiting toxicities or suboptimal potency. We report the discovery of zongertinib (BI 1810631), a covalent HER2 inhibitor. Zongertinib potently and selectively blocks HER2, while sparing EGFR, and inhibits the growth of cells dependent on HER2 oncogenic driver events, including HER2-dependent human cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab deruxtecan. Zongertinib displays potent antitumor activity in HER2-dependent human NSCLC xenograft models and enhances the activities of antibody-drug conjugates and KRASG12C inhibitors without causing obvious toxicities. The preclinical efficacy of zongertinib translates in objective responses in patients with HER2-dependent tumors, including cholangiocarcinoma (SDC4-NRG1 fusion) and breast cancer (V777L HER2 mutation), thus supporting the ongoing clinical development of zongertinib. Significance: HER2-mutant NSCLC poses a challenge in the clinic due to limited options for targeted therapies. Pan-ERBB blockers are limited by wild-type EGFR-mediated toxicity. Zongertinib is a highly potent and wild-type EGFR-sparing HER2 inhibitor that is active in HER2-driven tumors in the preclinical and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess the effectiveness and safety of various neoadjuvant treatment protocols in individuals diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive, her2 negative(HR+/HER2-) breast cancer. A systematic search was conducted in four databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) from the inception of the databases to January 16, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to various neoadjuvant therapy options in patients diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. A network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate pathological complete response (pCR). There were 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the analysis. These trials examined 16 different treatment regimens and involved a total of 5752 participants. The analysis revealed that the six most effective neoadjuvant treatment regimens for HR+/HER2- breast cancer were: CT(A)+olaparib (82.5%), CT(A)+nivolumab (76.5%), Com (74.9%), CT (72.1%), Mono+eribulin (72.0%), and CT(A)+pembrolizumab (70.4%).Paired meta-analysis for pathological complete response (pCR) found no statistically significant distinction between treatment regimens that included both anthracycline and immunosuppressants and regimens that relied solely on anthracycline chemotherapy(OR:1.14, 95%ci 0.79-1.64, I The CT(A)+Olaparib and CT(A)+nivolumab groups demonstrated superior efficacy in neoadjuvant therapy for HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Furthermore, it is crucial to focus on effectively managing the adverse effects of the treatment plan to enhance patient's ability to tolerate it. Given the constraints of the current research, additional well-executed and suitable RCTs are necessary to validate the findings of this investigation. Although pCR is valuable in assessing the effect of neoadjuvant therapy in some cases, prognostic prediction and efficacy assessment in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer should be based on a combination of broader clinical and biological characteristics.

We previously unveiled that estrogen receptor \u03b1 transcriptionally up-regulates PD-L1 and aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole increase the efficacy of pembrolizumab. Here we investigated if letrozole may have additional immune-sensitizing mechanisms. We found that higher the level of PD-L1 in NSCLC, higher the activation of SREBP1c that transcriptionally increases fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzymes, increasing the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Letrozole further up-regulated SREBP1c-mediated transcription of lipogenic genes, and increased the amount of PUFAs, thereby leading to greater membrane fluidity and reduced binding between PD-L1 and PD-1. The same effects were observed upon supplementation with \u03c93-PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that enhanced the efficacy of pembrolizumab in humanized NSCLC immune-xenografts. We suggest that PUFA enrichment in membrane phospholipids improves the efficacy of ICIs. We propose to repurpose letrozole or DHA as new immune-sensitizing agents in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the impact of the level of HER2 overexpression on pathologic and clinical outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Women with Stage II or III HER2-positive BC who received anthracycline-taxane-trastuzumab NAT regimens followed by curative-intent surgery were included. Patients were classified according to tumor HER2 expression into HER2-high (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) HER2/CEP17 ratio \u22655 or HER2 copy number \u226510) and HER2-intermediate (IHC 2+ with HER2/CEP17 ratio \u22652 to <5 or copy number \u22654 to <10). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using HER2 expression as a categorical variable. The primary outcome was pathological complete response (pCR). Estimated 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were secondary outcomes. Among 161 patients with HER2-positive BC, 139 (86%) and 22 (14%) were classified as HER2-high and HER2-intermediate, respectively; 105 (65.2%) had hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors; 72 (45%) achieved a pCR. In the overall population, pCR rates of 18% and 49% were achieved in HER2-intermediate and HER2-high cases, respectively (odds ratio [OR] = 0.23 95% CI 0.07-0.72; P = .007). No pCRs were observed among HR-positive, HER2-intermediate cases. Estimated 3-year DFS was 97.1% versus 89.3% for patients achieving a pCR versus those with residual disease, respectively (P = .0011). We found that patients with HER2-high disease were more likely to achieve pCR after NAT compared to patients with HER2-intermediate BC, a subgroup of patients that may benefit from more personalized NAT strategies.",

    "title": "crVDAC3 alleviates ferroptosis by impeding HSPB1 ubiquitination and confers trastuzumab deruxtecan resistance in HER2-low breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "With the wide application of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), the survival of HER2-low breast cancer patients is dramatically improved. However, resistance to T-DXd still exists in a subset of patients, and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. An in vivo shRNA lentiviral library functional screening was performed to identify potential circular RNA (crRNA) that mediates T-DXd resistance. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism. Ferroptosis was detected using C11-BODIPY, Liperfluo, FerroOrange staining, glutathione quantification, malondialdehyde quantification, and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used to validate therapeutic agents. VDAC3-derived crRNA (crVDAC3) ranked first in functional shRNA library screening. Knockdown of crVDAC3 increased the sensitivity of HER2-low breast cancer cells to T-DXd treatment. Further mechanistic research revealed that crVDAC3 specifically binds to HSPB1 protein and inhibits its ubiquitination degradation, leading to intracellular accumulation and increased levels of HSPB1 protein. Notably, suppression of crVDAC3 dramatically increases excessive ROS levels and labile iron pool accumulation. Inhibition of crVDAC3 induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by reducing HSPB1 expression, thereby mediating T-DXd resistance. Through virtual screening and experimental validation, we identified that paritaprevir could effectively bind to crVDAC3 and prevent its interaction with HSPB1 protein, thereby increasing ubiquitination degradation of HSPB1 protein to overcome T-DXd resistance. Finally, we validated the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of T-DXd by paritaprevir in a HER2-low PDX model. This finding reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying T-DXd resistance in HER2-low breast cancer. Our study provides a new strategy to overcome T-DXd resistance by inhibiting the interaction between crVDAC3 and HSPB1 protein.",

    "title": "A pooled analysis of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases.",
    "abstract": "This exploratory pooled analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus comparator treatment in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) with brain metastases (BMs) at baseline, categorized according to previous local treatment. T-DXd data were pooled from DESTINY-Breast01/-02/-03. Comparator data, from patients receiving physician's choice therapy and trastuzumab emtansine, were pooled from DESTINY-Breast02 and -03, respectively. Baseline BM status was assessed according to US Food and Drug Administration criteria. The endpoints included intracranial objective response rate (ORR; complete or partial response in the brain) per blinded independent central review (BICR) by RECIST version 1.1, time to intracranial response, intracranial duration of response (DoR), central nervous system progression-free survival (CNS-PFS) by BICR, overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 148 patients who received T-DXd and 83 patients who received comparator treatment had BMs at baseline. In those treated with T-DXd, the intracranial ORR of patients with treated/stable and untreated/active BMs was 45.2% and 45.5%, respectively. The median (range) time to intracranial response was 2.8 months (1.1-13.9 months) and 1.5 months (1.2-13.7 months) in patients with treated/stable and untreated/active BMs, respectively. For those with treated/stable BMs, the median intracranial DoR was 12.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-17.9] months, and for those with untreated/active BMs, it was 17.5 months (95% CI 13.6-31.6 months). The median CNS-PFS and OS were 12.3 months (95% CI 11.1-13.8 months) and not reached (95% CI 22.1 months-not estimable) in those with treated/stable BMs, and 18.5 months (95% CI 13.6-23.3 months) and 30.2 months (95% CI 21.3 months-not estimable) in those with untreated/active BMs, respectively. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events grade \u22653 were experienced by 43.2% of patients with BMs and 46.4% without BMs with T-DXd. T-DXd demonstrated meaningful intracranial efficacy and clinical benefit in OS, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile in patients with HER2-positive mBC with treated/stable and untreated/active BMs.",

    "abstract": "QL1701 is a proposed biosimilar to the reference trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae). This trial compared the efficacy and safety of QL1701 with the reference trastuzumab in first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. This randomized, double-blinded, parallel-controlled, phase III equivalence trial was conducted in 73 centers in China. Eligible patients with histologically or cytologically diagnosed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive either QL1701 or reference trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel (every 3 weeks) for eight cycles as the first-line treatment. Then, in patients with objective responses or stable disease, the QL1701 or reference trastuzumab with or without docetaxel was maintained for totally up to 12 months if tolerated. The primary endpoint was 24-week objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). The equivalence margin was 0.80-1.25 with a 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ORR ratio (QL1701 to reference trastuzumab). Between 29 April 2020 and 15 March 2022, 474 patients were randomized, and 473 received either QL1701 (n\u00a0=\u00a0236) or reference trastuzumab (n\u00a0= 237). The risk ratio for 24-week ORR was 1.07 (90% CI 0.94-1.21). The 90% CI fell within the pre-specified equivalence margin of 0.80-1.25. The 24-week ORR assessed by IRC was 59.7% (95% CI 53.2% to 66.1%) versus 56.1% (95% CI 49.5% to 62.5%) in QL1701 and the reference trastuzumab, respectively. As of 12 April 2023, there were no notable differences in progression-free survival (median: 8.3 versus 8.4 months) and overall survival (1-year rate: 95.1% versus 93.3%) between the two groups. Safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and immunogenicity profiles were similar between the two groups. QL1701 demonstrated equivalent efficacy and similar safety to the reference trastuzumab when combined with docetaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with similar PK and immunogenicity profiles.",

    "abstract": "Different targeted therapy options exist for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the lapatinib plus capecitabine combination after TDM-1 in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. We retrospectively evaluated the HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients' data. The patients who progressed after trastuzumab-based chemotherapy and TDM-1 were included in the study. We used the Kaplan-Meier for survival analysis. Eighteen patients were involved in the study. The average age was 48 (range 31-65). De novo metastatic patient's number was 5 (27.8%). The most common metastatic sites were liver (50%), lung (44.4%), and brain (44.4%), respectively. All patients were previously treated with trastuzumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy and TDM-1. Also, seven (38.9%) patients received hormonotherapy and twelve (66.7%) patients received palliative radiotherapy. The complete response ratio was 5.6%, partial response 11.8%, and stable response 29.4%. Median progression-free survival was found as 5.5 (95% CI, 3.2-7.7) months. The hematological and non-hematological toxicity ratio was 41.2% and 52.9%, respectively. Grade 3-4 toxicity (diarrhea, anemia, and mucositis) was observed in four (22.2%) patients. The median OS duration was 8.2\u00a0months (95% CI, 4.3-12.0). Treatment options are limited in heavily pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Despite a small number of patients, this study showed that the lapatinib plus capecitabine combination was effective and well-tolerated in heavily pretreated HER2-positive breast cancer patients after TDM-1.",
