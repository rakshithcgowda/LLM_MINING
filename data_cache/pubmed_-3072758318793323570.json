    "title": "Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy Per PD-L1 Stratum In Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Real-World Effectiveness Versus Trial Efficacy.",
    "abstract": "Clinical trial efficacy and real-world effectiveness of oncological treatments can differ. This study assessed the real-world survival outcomes of first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy per PD-L1 stratum in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) and compared them to clinical trial results. All patients with nonsquamous and squamous mNSCLC who received first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in 7 Dutch teaching hospitals between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021 were included. Hazard ratios (HR) with confidence intervals (95% CI) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated to determine the efficacy-effectiveness gap (EE gap) between real-world and clinical trial, stratified by PD-L1 stratum. The nonsquamous cohort (n = 486) consisted of 269 patients with PD-L1 < 1%, 158 with PD-L1 1% to 49%, and 59 with PD-L1 \u2265 50%. The squamous cohort (n = 117) consisted of 70 patients with PD-L1 < 1% and 47 with PD-L1 \u2265 1%. For OS, an EE gap was observed in nonsquamous patients with PD-L1 < 1% (HR 1.38 (95% CI 1.06-1.78; median OS 10 vs. 17.2 months) and HRs consistently >1 in all other nonsquamous and squamous PD-L1 strata, although not statistically significant. No EE-gap for PFS was observed in any stratum. No significant EE gap was found for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, except in the stratum nonsquamous mNSCLC with <1% PD-L1 tumor expression. In these patients, the survival in real-world was considerably shorter compared to the clinical trial results. Further studies are needed to determine which patient, treatment and or context factors contribute to this disparity.",

    "abstract": "No direct comparison has been performed between different programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors for first-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The feasibility of using PD-L1-expression-guided immunotherapy remains unknown. In this open-label, phase 2 study (NCT04252365), patients with advanced NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alterations were randomized (1:1) to receive sintilimab or pembrolizumab monotherapy (PD-L1 expression\u00a0\u2265\u00a050%), or sintilimab or pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (PD-L1 expression\u00a0<\u00a050%). The sample size was calculated by optimal two-stage design. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The study included 71 patients (sintilimab arms, n\u00a0=\u00a035; pembrolizumab arms, n\u00a0=\u00a036) and met its primary endpoint, with a confirmed ORR of 51.4% (18/35) in the sintilimab arms. The confirmed ORR (95% confidence interval) was 46.2% (19.2%, 74.9%) and 42.9% (17.7%, 71.1%) for patients treated with sintilimab and pembrolizumab monotherapy; and 54.5% (32.2%, 75.6%) and 45.4% (24.4%, 67.8%) for those treated with sintilimab- and pembrolizumab-based combination therapies. The median progression-free survival was 6.9 versus 8.1\u00a0months for all sintilimab-treated versus all pembrolizumab-treated patients, respectively, in which it was 7.6 versus 11.0\u00a0months in monotherapy and 7.4 versus 7.1\u00a0months in combination therapies. The median overall survival was 14.9 versus 21.3\u00a0months for all sintilimab-treated versus all pembrolizumab-treated patients, respectively, in which it was 14.9 versus 22.6\u00a0months in monotherapy and 14.7 versus 17.3\u00a0months in combination therapies. Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with safety outcomes of monotherapy and combination therapy in previous phase III studies. However, the incidence of rash was higher with sintilimab than pembrolizumab monotherapy. This is the first prospective phase 2 study to directly compare two anti-PD-1 antibodies as first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC. Sintilimab was efficacious and well-tolerated irrespective of PD-L1 expression level in patients with advanced NSCLC and had similar efficacy and safety to pembrolizumab.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between antinuclear antibody (ANA) and the efficacy of programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade remains controversial. Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of ANA titer in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy as the first-line treatment, compared with that of platinum-based chemotherapy with PD-1 blockade. Our clinical data based on the ANA titer (1:80) were retrospectively reviewed for patients with advanced NSCLC, who were treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy with PD-1 blockade. Immunohistochemical staining for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes such as CD4, CD8 and Foxp3 was performed. Among 106 patients treated with pembrolizumab, 19 (17.9%) tested high for ANA. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly better in patients with high ANA than in those with low ANA, and high ANA was identified as an independent prognostic predictor, particularly in the subgroup with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)\u2009\u2265\u200950%. However, no statistically significant difference in PFS and OS based on the ANA titer was observed in 59 patients treated with combinational chemotherapy and immunotherapy. High numbers of intratumoral Foxp3 and stromal CD8 were significantly associated with low ANA. Assessment of preexisting ANA titers was useful to prognose PD-1 blockade as a first-line setting, particularly for the PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% subgroup, but not in the case of combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this network meta-analysis was to elucidate the efficacy and safety of various immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data from randomised controlled trials comparing perioperative ICI-chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone were acquired from the EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library databases, PubMed, and meeting abstracts from inception until August 2023. The endpoints for this analysis were pathological complete response, event-free survival and treatment-related adverse events of any grade or adverse events of grade 3 or higher. In total, six randomised controlled trials with 2538 NSCLC patients were selected for this network meta-analysis. Compared with other ICIs, toripalimab + chemotherapy demonstrated increased pathological complete response rates and prolonged event-free survival in NSCLC. In patients with negative/low PD-L1 expression or squamous cell pathology, toripalimab + chemotherapy was the most effective regimen. In contrast, nivolumab + chemotherapy was preferable for patients with high PD-L1 expression or non-squamous cell pathology. Among the analysed regimens, toripalimab + chemotherapy presented the highest risk of adverse events of any grade, whereas nivolumab + chemotherapy showed the highest risk of grade 3-4 adverse events. Conversely, durvalumab + chemotherapy exhibited the lowest risk of grade 3-4 adverse events. Among the evaluated perioperative immunochemotherapy regimens, toripalimab + chemotherapy indicated a significantly increased survival benefit for most resectable NSCLC patients. However, for high PD-L1 expression and non-squamous NSCLC patients, nivolumab + chemotherapy provided the most potent outcomes. Perioperative durvalumab + chemotherapy is a relatively safe treatment. The findings of this investigation are expected to assist clinicians in making informed decisions among promising treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Currently, first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, are utilized as monotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression (\u226750%). Pre-treatment or post-treatment serum soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) has been identified as a potential biomarker for assessing ICI efficacy through fixed-point observations. However, existing studies on sPD-L1 changes have produced inconsistent results or have had sample sizes too small to detect clinically meaningful effect sizes. To elucidate the role of sPD-L1, we conducted a collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis of PD-1 inhibitor treatments. We conducted a thorough search of articles in PubMed via Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from inception to October 20, 2023. Trials were deemed eligible if they contained individual datasets for advanced NSCLC patients, including data on overall survival (OS)/progression-free survival (PFS), as well as pre- and post-treatment sPD-L1 levels after 3-4 cycles of PD-1 inhibitor treatments. Our analysis focused on patients who completed 3-4 cycles of PD-1 inhibitor treatments. The primary outcome measure was OS/PFS, and we assessed changes in sPD-L1 concentration pre- and post-treatment through ELISA analyses. From our search, we identified a potential seven trials, encompassing 256 patients. Among these, two trials with 26 patients met the criteria for inclusion in our primary analyses. Over a median follow-up period of 10 months, pooled univariate analysis revealed that increases in sPD-L1 levels during PD-1 inhibitor treatment were not associated with OS (HR = 1.25; CI: 0.52-3.02)/PFS (HR = 1.42; CI: 0.61-3.30) when compared to cases with sPD-L1 decreases. Subgroup analyses indicated that the impact of sPD-L1 changes on overall mortality/progression-related mortality remained consistent regardless of gender, age, or the type of treatment (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Our findings suggest that changes in sPD-L1 levels during PD-1 inhibitor treatment do not significantly influence the prognosis of advanced NSCLC patients, regardless of gender, age, or treatment type. Continuous monitoring of sPD-L1 may not offer significant advantages compared to fixed-point observations.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has altered the therapeutic landscape for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab targets the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis and produces durable clinical responses, but reliable biomarkers are lacking. Using 115 plasma samples from 42 pembrolizumab-treated patients with NSCLC, we were able to identify predictive biomarkers. In the plasma samples, we quantified the level of 92 proteins using the Olink proximity extension assay and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using targeted next-generation sequencing. Patients with an above-median progression-free survival (PFS) had significantly higher expressions of Fas ligand (FASLG) and inducible T-cell co-stimulator ligand (ICOSLG) at baseline than patients with a PFS below the median. A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that high levels of FASLG and ICOSLG were predictive of longer PFS and overall survival (OS) (PFS: 10.83 vs. 4.49 months, OS: 27.13 vs. 18.0 months). Furthermore, we identified a subgroup with high expressions of FASLG and ICOSLG who also had no detectable ctDNA mutations after treatment initiation. This subgroup had significantly longer PFS and OS rates compared to the rest of the patients (PFS: 25.71 vs. 4.52 months, OS: 34.62 vs. 18.0 months). These findings suggest that the expressions of FASLG and ICOSLG at baseline and the absence of ctDNA mutations after the start of treatment have the potential to predict clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 \u2265 50% doubles five-year survival rates compared to chemotherapy. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can cause severe, long-term toxicity necessitating high-dose steroids and/or treatment cessation. Interestingly, patients experiencing irAEs demonstrate better survival outcomes. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation, including the Scottish Inflammatory Prognostic Score (SIPS), also predict survival in this patient group. This study examines the relationship between inflammatory status, irAEs, and survival outcomes in NSCLC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 \u2265 50% receiving first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy at a large cancer centre in Scotland. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between SIPS, irAEs, and survival. 83/262 eligible patients (32%) experienced an irAE. Dermatological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and hepatic, but not pulmonary, irAEs were associated with prolonged PFS and OS ( The occurrence of certain irAEs is associated with a survival benefit in patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 \u2265 50% receiving pembrolizumab. We find that the association between low levels of systemic inflammation and the risk of irAEs is confounded by their independent prognostic value.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor used to treat advanced patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) \u226550. Further sub-division of TPS-based stratification has not been evaluated in the UK, although smoking-induced tumour mutational burden and the immunogenic effects of prior radiotherapy are suggested to improve response. To investigate if PD-L1 TPS \u226580%, smoking status or radiotherapy before or within 2 months of treatment influenced progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy. PD-L1 TPS, smoking status and radiotherapy exposure were compared in patients with NSCLC in National Health Service (NHS) Tayside (n=100) treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy between 1 November 2017 and 18 February 2022. Survival estimates were compared using log-rank analysis, and Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to investigate the influence of potential confounding factors, including tumour stage and performance status. PFS was not significantly different (log-rank HR=0.330, p=0.566) comparing patients with PD-L1 TPS 50-79%\u2009and PD-L1 TPS \u226580%. Smokers had significantly improved PFS (log-rank HR=4.867, p=0.027), while patients receiving radiotherapy had significantly decreased PFS (log-rank HR=6.649, p=0.012). A Cox regression model confirmed that both radiotherapy (p=0.022) and performance status (p=0.009) were independent negative predictors of PFS. More rigorous PD-L1 TPS stratification did not influence survival outcomes. Smoking history improved PFS, although it was not an independent response predictor, while radiotherapy and performance status independently influenced clinical response. We suggest that further stratification of PD-L1 TPS is not warranted, while performance status and radiotherapy treatment may be additional clinically useful biomarkers of response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "In CheckMate 227 Part 1, first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u22651% versus chemotherapy. We report results from CheckMate 227 Part 2, which evaluated nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Seven hundred and fifty-five patients with systemic therapy-naive, stage IV/recurrent NSCLC without EGFR mutations or ALK alterations were randomized 1 : 1 to nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was OS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. OS in all randomized patients was a hierarchically tested secondary endpoint. At 19.5 months' minimum follow-up, no significant improvement in OS was seen with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC [median OS 18.8 versus 15.6 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95.62% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.08, P\u00a0= 0.1859]. Descriptive analyses showed OS improvement with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in all randomized patients (median OS 18.3 versus 14.7 months, HR 0.81, 95.62% CI 0.67-0.97) and in an exploratory analysis in squamous NSCLC (median OS 18.3 versus 12.0 months, HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.97). A trend toward improved OS was seen with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, regardless of the tumor mutation status of STK11 or TP53, regardless of tumor mutational burden, and in patients with intermediate/poor Lung Immune Prognostic Index scores. Safety with nivolumab plus chemotherapy was consistent with previous reports of first-line settings. CheckMate 227 Part 2 did not meet the primary endpoint of OS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Descriptive analyses showed prolonged OS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy in all-randomized and squamous NSCLC populations, suggesting that this combination may benefit patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Standard therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant durvalumab. For biomarker-selected patients with LA-NSCLC, we hypothesized that sequential pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, would be well-tolerated and effective. Patients with stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible for this trial. Patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of \u226550% received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, once every 21 days), followed by a 20-fraction course of risk-adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic volume exceeding 20 cc, 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions), followed by consolidation pembrolizumab to complete a 1-year treatment course. The primary study end point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rates after induction pembrolizumab, overall survival (OS), and adverse events. Twenty-five patients with a PD-L1 TPS of \u226550% were enrolled. The median age was 71, most patients (88%) had stage IIIA or IIIB disease, and the median PD-L1 TPS was 75%. Two patients developed disease progression during induction pembrolizumab, and two patients discontinued pembrolizumab after one infusion because of immune-related adverse events. Using RECIST criteria, 12 patients (48%) exhibited a partial or complete response after induction pembrolizumab. Twenty-four patients (96%) received definitive thoracic radiotherapy. The 1-year PFS rate is 76%, satisfying our efficacy objective. One- and 2-year OS rates are 92% and 76%, respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse events were colitis (n = 2, 8%) and esophagitis (n = 2, 8%), and no higher-grade treatment-related adverse events have occurred. Pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, are a promising treatment approach for patients with LA-NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of \u226550%.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a unique subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a high degree of malignancy and poor therapeutic effects. With the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent years, few studies have reported that immunotherapy is effective against PSC. As a multi-target anti-vascular targeting agent, anlotinib showed a better anti-tumor effect in various cancer species. The paper reported the therapeutic and side effects of pembrolizumab combined with anlotinib in a patient with advanced PSC. This is a 73 year old female patient who underwent thoracoscopy right upper lobectomy and was diagnosed as locally advanced PSC. However, the patient experienced tumor recurrence and metastasis 7 weeks after surgery and was unable to tolerate chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, she detected TP53 mutation and found that tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1 were high expression. Therefore, the patient received pembrolizumab combined with anlotinib treatment. After 15 cycles of treatment, the tumor significantly shrank with no tumor activity. The evaluation of tumor efficacy is partial response (PR). During the treatment period, she experienced one-degree thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and two-degree hand-foot syndrome. Pembrolizumab and anlotinib was continued for two years as a maintenance treatment. The patient had a good quality of life and no disease progression was observed. Currently, the patient is still alive without tumor progression and has overall survival exceeding 45 months and toxic side effects were tolerable. Combining ICIs and anti-angiogenic targeted therapy has brought new hope in treating advanced PSC. Additionally, TMB and PD-L1 expression could be potential predictive biomarkers of the efficacy in advanced PSC with immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapies can substantially improve treatment efficacy, despite their high cost. A comprehensive overview of the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer based on different tumor proportion scores (TPSs) was conducted. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, and NHS Economic Evaluation databases were searched from their inception until August 24, 2022. Data relevant to the CEA results were recorded, and quality assessments conducted based on the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) process. Fifty-one original studies from seven countries were included. The mean QHES score was 77.0 (range: 53-95). Twenty-seven studies were classified as high-quality, and the rest as fair quality. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, atezolizumab, camrelizumab, cemiplimab, sintilimab, tislelizumab, and durvalumab were identified using three TPS categories. While nivolumab\u00a0plus ipilimumab and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy were unlikely to be cost-effective in China, the results for the US were uncertain. Atezolizumab combinations were not cost-effective in China or the US, and tislelizumab and sintilimab were cost-effective in China. For TPSs \u2265\u00a050%, the pembrolizumab monotherapy could be cost-effective in some developed countries. Cemiplimab was more cost-effective than chemotherapy, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab in the US. For TPSs \u2265\u00a01%, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab was controversial due to the different willingness-to-pay thresholds. None of the atezolizumab combination regimens were found to be cost-effective in any perspective of evaluations. Camrelizumab, tislelizumab, and sintilimab have lower ICERs compared to atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab in China. Cemiplimab may be a more affordable alternative to pembrolizumab or atezolizumab. However, it remains unclear which ICIs are the best choices for each country. Future CEAs are required to select comprehensive regimens alongside randomized trials and real-world studies to help verify the economics of ICIs in specific decision-making settings.",

Previous studies have elucidated that PSC generally exhibits a significant expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an elevated tumor mutation burden, and marked vascular invasion. These factors imply the possible effectiveness of treatments like immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. The subject of this case was a 65-year-old male diagnosed with advanced PSC, characterized by high PD-L1 expression and devoid of known driver gene mutations. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient initially underwent home-based treatment with anlotinib, which led to symptomatic improvement after a single treatment cycle. Subsequent hospitalization allowed for the administration of anlotinib plus Pembrolizumab, resulting in a partial response. Radiotherapy was necessitated due to local disease progression. But after 15 cycles of treatment with Pembrolizumab, hyperprogression was observed. The patient's overall survival spanned 14 months, with no evident adverse reactions to the medications.

However, appropriate treatment for patients showing high PD-L1 expression and poor performance status (PS) is not well defined. The aim of this study was to identify a treatment option that is better for these patients in a real-world setting. A total of 425 patients with NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression were included retrospectively. All patients received either pembrolizumab monotherapy or ICI plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. Patients were subdivided into good (PS score 0 or 1; n\u00a0=\u00a0354) and poor PS groups (PS score 2 or 3; n\u00a0=\u00a071). Early progressive disease (PD) was defined as PD within 3 months of ICI-based therapy initiation. The good PS group had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than the poor PS group upon ICI-based therapy administration. In the poor PS group, no significant difference was observed in PFS and OS between pembrolizumab monotherapy and ICI plus chemotherapy. In the good PS group, pembrolizumab monotherapy, PD-L1 50-89%, and liver metastasis were associated with early PD, as determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. However, in the poor PS group, the multivariate logistic regression analyses did not show an association between pembrolizumab monotherapy and early PD. In patients with NSCLC exhibiting poor PS and high PD-L1 expression, ICI plus chemotherapy did not confer PFS or OS benefit compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Large fractions of radiotherapy of 8 Gy (ultra-hypofractionated RT, ultra-hypoRT) promote anti-tumor immune responses that have been clinically substantiated in combination trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In the current study, we postulated that ultra-hypoRT in combination with ICIs may enhance tumor clearance in NSCLC patients with locoregional relapse after radical chemo-RT. Between 2019 and 2021, eleven patients received re-irradiation with one or two fractions of 8 Gy concurrently with anti-PD1 immunotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). RT-related toxicities were negligible, while immune-related adverse events enforced immunotherapy interruption in 36% of patients. The overall response rate was 81.8%. Tumor reduction between 80 and 100% was noted in 63.5% of patients. Within a median follow-up of 22 months, the locoregional relapse-free rate was 54.5%, while the projected 2-year disease-specific overall survival was 62%. The results were independent of PD-L1 status. The current report provides encouraging evidence that a relatively low biological dose of RT delivered with 8 Gy fractions is feasible and can be safely combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Despite the low number of patients, the significant tumor regression achieved and the long-lasting locoregional control and overall progression-free intervals provide a basis to pursue immuno-RT trials with U-hypoRT schemes in this group of NSCLC patients of poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the LDH-to-albumin ratio (LAR) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab monotherapy. We comprehensively analyzed the associations between LAR and clinical parameters, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) to identify reliable biomarkers for treatment selection. A total of 144 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with nivolumab were included. Patient characteristics, including demographic data, smoking history, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and LAR were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the associations between these factors and PFS/OS. The LAR cut-off value was determined using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The median overall survival was 14.2 months, and the median progression-free survival was 5.28 months. Univariate analysis showed that smoking, ECOG performance score, brain metastasis, PD-L1 level, nivolumab treatment line, albumin, hemoglobin, LDH levels, platelet count, monocyte count, lymphocyte count, and LAR were associated with PFS. In the multivariate analysis, only LAR remained significantly associated with PFS. For overall survival, smoking, ECOG performance score, albumin level, LDH level, platelet count, monocyte count, lymphocyte count, brain metastasis, LAR, nivolumab treatment line, and PD-L1 level were significant in the univariate analysis. Albumin level, ECOG performance score, and LAR were independently associated with overall survival in the multivariate analysis. The LAR, reflecting tumor burden, tumor hypoxia, immune response, nutritional status, and systemic inflammation, emerged as a potential prognostic biomarker in NSCLC receiving nivolumab monotherapy. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in treatment decisions and supports the need for personalized approaches in NSCLC immunotherapy. Further research is needed to validate the utility of LAR as a predictive biomarker in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of immunotherapy, there has been a significant improvement in the outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer treatment. Several clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, but research with real-world data is needed to confirm the findings from clinical trials. In this retrospective study, data on the treatment of lung cancer with pembrolizumab were analyzed in 78 patients who started pembrolizumab therapy as first-line treatment for metastatic disease at University Hospital Centre Osijek, from May 15, 2018, until December 31, 2021. November 30, 2022, was set as the last date of data monitoring. Patients who had received less than 3 cycles of pembrolizumab were excluded from the study. The main objectives of the study were OS (overall survival) and PFS (progression-free survival). The differences in the incidence and type of adverse events between the two groups of patients were also compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the survival determined that the median OS was 20 months and PFS was 13 months. Although OS and PFS are longer in patients with PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) \u2265 50%, the differences are not statistically significant. The most commonly reported adverse events related to pembrolizumab treatment were gastrointestinal adverse events. No significant differences were found in the frequency of occurrence of certain adverse events between the two groups of patients. This study demonstrates that real-world data for pembrolizumab treatment of non-small cell lung cancer confirm the efficacy and safety indicated by clinical trials. Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess the patient's general condition more objectively before starting the treatment.",

    "abstract": "Numerous first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were developed for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking driver gene mutations. However, this group consists of a heterogeneous patient population, for whom the optimal therapeutic choice is yet to be confirmed. To identify the best first-line immunotherapy regimen for overall advanced NSCLC patients and different subgroups. Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). We searched several databases to retrieve relevant literature. We performed Bayesian NMA for the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and treatment-related adverse events (tr-AEs) with a grade equal or more than 3 (grade\u2009\u2a7e\u20093 tr-AEs). Subgroup analysis was conducted according to programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels, histologic type, central nervous system (CNS) metastases and tobacco use history. For the PD-L1 non-selective patients, sintilimab plus chemotherapy (sinti-chemo) provided the best OS [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.59, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.42-0.83]. Nivolumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (nivo-bev-chemo) was comparable to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (atezo-bev-chemo) in prolonging PFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI: 0.51-1.91). Atezo-bev-chemo remarkably elevated the ORR than chemotherapy (OR\u2009=\u20093.13, 95% CI: 1.51-6.59). Subgroup analysis showed pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembro-chemo) ranked first in OS in subgroups of PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, non-squamous, no CNS metastases, with or without smoking history, and ranked second in OS in subgroups of PD-L1\u2009\u2a7e\u20091% and PD-L1 1-49%. Cemiplimab and sugemalimab plus chemotherapy ranked first in OS and PFS for squamous subgroup, respectively. For patients with CNS metastases, nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy (nivo-ipili-chemo) and camrelizumab plus chemotherapy provided the best OS and PFS, respectively. Sinti-chemo and nivo-bev-chemo were two effective first-line regimens ranked first in OS and PFS for overall patients, respectively. Pembro-chemo was favorable for patients in subgroups of PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, PD-L1\u2009\u2a7e\u20091%, PD-L1 1-49%, non-squamous, no CNS metastases, with or without smoking history. Addition of bevacizumab consistently provided with favorable PFS results in patients of all PD-L1 levels. Cemiplimab was the best option in squamous subgroup and nivo-ipili-chemo in CNS metastases subgroup due to their advantages in OS. First-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for advanced NSCLC patients lacking driver gene mutations Patients with advance non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking driver gene mutations are a group of heterogeneous people. Although numerous therapeutic regimens were developed, the optimal choice for advanced NSCLC patients and specific subgroups is yet to be identified.We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis with the currently available data, and performed subgroup analyses according to programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels, histologic type, CNS metastases and tobacco use history.Our key findings were as follows: (1) in non-selective PD-L1 groups, sinti-chemo and pembro-chemo provided the best OS outcome; nivo-bev-chemo and atezo-bev-chemo resulted in the most prolonged PFS; atezo-bev-chemo and pembro-chemo yielded significantly improved ORR; (2) pembro-chemo was favorable for patients in subgroups of PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, PD-L1\u2009\u2a7e\u20091%, PD-L1 1\u201349%, non-squamous, no CNS metastases, with or without smoking history; (3) immunochemotherapies involving anti-PD-1 agents generally exhibited potential advantages over those with anti-PD-L1 drugs; (4) addition of anti-VEGF drugs to immunochemotherapies consistently provided with favorable PFS results in advanced NSCLC patients with or without PD-L1 selection; (5) in patients with squamous NSCLC, cemiplimab and suge-chemo were the optimal drugs for improving OS and PFS, respectively; in patients with non-squamous NSCLC, pembro-chemo provided the best OS, while nivo-bev-chemo, atezo-bev-chemo, sinti-chemo, and pembro-chemo showed comparable advantages in improving PFS; (6) for patients with CNS metastases, nivo-ipili-chemo and camre-chemo provided the best OS and PFS, respectively.Our findings provide evidence for a more precise selection of first-line immunotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) lacks sensitivity for pembrolizumab immunotherapy selection in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for tumors with low expression. We retrospectively evaluated transcriptomic PD-L1 by mRNA next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq). In an unselected NSCLC patient cohort (n = 3168) tested during standard care (2017-2021), PD-L1 IHC and RNA-seq demonstrated moderate concordance, with 80% agreement overall. Most discordant cases were either low or negative for PD-L1 expression by IHC but high by RNA-seq. RNA-seq accurately discriminated PD-L1 IHC high from low tumors by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis but could not distinguish PD-L1 IHC low from negative tumors. In a separate pembrolizumab monotherapy cohort (n = 102), NSCLC tumors classified as PD-L1 high versus not high by RNA-seq had significantly improved response, progression-free survival, and overall survival as an individual measure and in combination with IHC high or low status. PD-L1 IHC status (high or low) trended toward but had no significant associations with improved outcomes. Conventional PD-L1 IHC testing has inherent limitations, making it an imperfect reference standard for evaluating novel testing technologies. RNA-seq offers an objective PD-L1 measure that could represent a complementary method to IHC to improve NSCLC patient selection for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Outside clinical trials, few data are available on the effect of long-term first-line pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancers with \u226550% of tumor cells expressing programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). This French, multicenter study included consecutive advanced patients with non-small-cell lung cancer given first-line pembrolizumab alone between May 2017 (authorization date for this indication) and November 2019 (authorization date for pembrolizumab-chemotherapy combination). Information was collected from patients' medical files, with a local evaluation of the response and progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS) was calculated from pembrolizumab onset using the Kaplan-Meier method. The analysis concerned 845 patients, managed in 33 centers: median age: 65 (range: 59-72) years, 67.8% men, 78.1% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1, 38.9%/51.5%/6.6% active, ex or never-smokers, respectively, 10.9%/16.8% taking or recently took corticosteroids/antibiotics, 69.6% nonsquamous histology, 48.9% \u226575% PD-L1-positive, and 20.8% had brain metastases at diagnosis. After a median (95% CI) follow-up of 45 (44.1-45.9) months, respective median (95% CI) PFS and OS lasted 8.2 (6.9-9.2) and 22 (8.5-25.9) months; 3-year PFS and OS rates were 25.4% and 39.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis retained never-smoker status, adenocarcinoma histology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22652, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio >4 as being significantly associated with shorter survival, but not brain metastases at diagnosis or <75% PD-L1 tumor-cell expression. These long-term results of pembrolizumab efficacy based on a nationwide \"real-world\" cohort reproduced those obtained in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Strategies using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), which can enhance antitumor immune responses, have revolutionized the lung cancer therapeutic landscape. The ICI mechanism of action involves the blockade of regulatory cell surface molecules using antibodies against the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) (ipilimumab, tremelimumab); the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1; nivolumab, pembrolizumab); or the PD ligand-1 (PD-L1; atezolizumab, durvalumab). Notably, anti-PD-1 demonstrated long-term survival benefits, durable objective responses, and a manageable safety profile in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combination of anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 and platinum chemotherapy achieved better survival outcomes than chemotherapy alone, which was observed irrespective of PD-L1 expression on cancer cells. Although promising results have been reported from large clinical trials, especially for patients with high PD-L1 expression, the optimal treatment approach for patients with PD-L1-negative NSCLC has yet to be defined. We propose a guide for clinicians in the therapeutic decision-making process based on the latest data available about treatments, prognostic factors, predictive biomarkers, and real-world evidence in PD-L1-negative NSCLC patients.",

The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of metastatic NSCLC treated in routine practice on the treatment regimen of the CheckMate 9LA protocol. Medical records of 58 patients treated at Soroka and Bnai Zion Medical Centers between May 2020 and February 2022 were analyzed. All patients were treated with a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy of nivolumab every three weeks and ipilimumab every 6 weeks. The patients received 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy according to the physician's choice: platinum-based cisplatin or carboplatin with either pemetrexed or paclitaxel. The median PFS was 10.2 months, longer than that of the 9LA trial (6.7 months). Adenocarcinoma patients exhibited a higher median OS of 13.7 (range 5-33) months than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients at 12.3 (5-20) months and PFS of 10.3 (4-33) months, while squamous cell carcinoma patients had a PFS of 9.2 (4-18) months. Patients whose programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor expression level was \u22651% showed a higher median OS than those with PD-L1 expression of less than 1%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 93.1% of patients, mostly grade 1 in severity. The first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients in combination with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy can be given safely in routine clinical practice, with results comparable to those achieved in clinical trials of the regimen.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate whether cyclophosphamide (C) and adriamycin (A) induction therapy (IT) prior to nivolumab could enhance the efficacy of nivolumab in previously treated patients with non-squamous (NSQ) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with less than 10% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Twenty-two enrolled patients received four cycles of CA-IT every 3 weeks. Nivolumab was given 360 mg every 3 weeks from the second cycle and 480 mg every 4 weeks after four cycles of CA-IT. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.4 months and 11.6 months, respectively. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed the lowest ratio of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to CD8+T-cells in the responders. Proteomic analysis identified a consistent upregulation of extracellular matrix-receptor interactions and phagosome pathways in the responders. Among the differentially expressed proteins, the transferrin receptor protein (TFRC) was higher in the responders before treatment (fold change > 1.2). TFRC validation with an independent cohort showed the prognostic significance of either OS or PFS in patients with low PD-L1 expression. In summary, CA-IT did not improve nivolumab efficacy in NSQ-NSCLCs with low PD-L1 expression; however, it induced decreasing MDSC, resulting in a durable response. Higher baseline TFRC levels predicted a favorable response to nivolumab in NSCLC with low PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials have been revolutionizing the perioperative treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many of these clinical trials involve cancer immunotherapies with antibody drugs that block the inhibitory immune checkpoints programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. While these new treatments are expected to improve the treatment outcome of NSCLC patients after pulmonary resection, several major clinical questions remain, including the appropriate timing of immunotherapy (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or both) and the identification of patients who should be treated with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant immunotherapies, because some early-stage NSCLC patients are cured by surgical resection alone. In addition, immunotherapy may induce immune-related adverse events that will require permanent treatment in some patients. Based on this fact as well, it is desirable to select appropriate patients for neoadjuvant/adjuvant immunotherapies. So far, data from several important trials have been published, with findings demonstrating the efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab (IMpower010 trial), neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (CheckMate816 trial), and several perioperative (neoadjuvant plus adjuvant) immunotherapies (AEGEAN, KEYNOTE-671, NADIM II, and Neotorch trials). In addition to these key trials, numerous clinical trials have reported a wealth of data, although most of the above clinical questions have not been completely answered yet. Because there are so many ongoing clinical trials in this field, a comprehensive understanding of the results and/or contents of these trials is necessary to explore answers to the clinical questions above as well as to plan a new clinical trial. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent data obtained from clinical trials addressing such questions.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Several studies have investigated potential interactions between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and commonly prescribed medications. Although acetaminophen (APAP) has not been considered susceptible to interaction with ICIs, recent research has shown that detectable plasma levels of this drug can hinder the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies. A reliable assessment of the potential interaction between APAP and ICIs in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients would be worthwhile since it is often prescribed in this condition. We sought to evaluate the impact of the concomitant use of APAP in patients with advanced NSCLC on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade using real-world evidence. (2) Methods: This study included consecutive patients with histologically proven stage IV NSCLC who underwent first-line therapy with pembrolizumab as a single agent or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, or second-line therapy with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab. The intensity of APAP exposure was classified as low (therapeutic intake lasting less than 24 h or a cumulative intake lower than 60 doses of 1000 mg) or high (therapeutic intake lasting more than 24 h or a total intake exceeding 60 doses of 1000 mg). The favorable outcome of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies was defined by durable clinical benefit (DCB). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were relevant to our efficacy analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) methods were applied to adjust for differences between the APAP exposure subgroups. (3) Results: Over the course of April 2018 to October 2022, 80 patients were treated with first-line pembrolizumab either as single-agent therapy or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. During the period from June 2015 to November 2022, 145 patients were given anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy as second-line treatment. Subsequent efficacy analyses relied on adjusted PSM populations in both treatment settings. Multivariate testing revealed that only the level of APAP and corticosteroid intake had an independent effect on DCB in both treatment lines. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed high exposure to APAP and immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy as independent predictors of shorter PFS and OS in both treatment settings. (4) Conclusions: Our findings would strengthen the available evidence that concomitant intake of APAP blunts the efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC. The detrimental effects appear to depend on the cumulative dose and duration of exposure to APAP. The inherent shortcomings of the current research warrant confirmation in larger independent series.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often exhibits elevated Secreted Protein Acidic and Cysteine-Rich (SPARC) expression. In this study, we investigated the impact of SPARC expression on clinicopathologic features, pembrolizumab response, and prognosis in metastatic NSCLC patients. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC without actionable driver mutation and who received pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy were included in this study. PD-L1 and SPARC expression were evaluated, with PD-L1 expression categorized based on tumor proportion score and SPARC staining intensity graded as 1+, 2+, and 3\u00a0+. Patients' characteristics were compared across groups, and possible predictive markers were determined by binary logistic regression analysis. No significant associations were found between SPARC expression and smoking status, histopathological tumor type, T and N status, and liver and bone metastasis. Higher SPARC expression was significantly linked to lower brain metastasis rates but higher CNS progression rates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.011, respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) showed a trend of being higher in the SPARC 1\u00a0+\u00a0group (85.7% vs. 43.8% and 50.0% in 2\u00a0+\u00a0and 3\u00a0+\u00a0groups, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.052. Univariate analysis did not find SPARC expression to be a significant prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7) and overall survival (OS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07).SPARC 1\u00a0+\u00a0expression negatively affected the pembrolizumab response(p\u00a0=\u00a00.04,OR:0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.92). Our study sheds light on a novel aspect of SPARC expression as a potential predictor of pembrolizumab response and a marker for CNS progression in metastatic NSCLC patients treated in the first-line setting.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers for predicting the outcome of ipilimumab plus nivolumab (Nivo-Ipi) treatment in cancer patients have not been identified. Herein, we investigated the prognostic significance of inflammatory and nutritional markers in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving Nivo-Ipi. Our study retrospectively analyzed 101 patients with advanced NSCLC who received Nivo-Ipi at a single institution. Inflammatory and nutritional indices were correlated with patient outcomes and included the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), and Glasgow prognostic score (GPS). The NLR significantly correlated with the PLR, SII, PNI, ALI, and GPS. Regarding therapeutic efficacy, the NLR, SII, and PNI predicted a partial response, and all indices predicted progressive disease. In subgroup analyses, the SII, PNI, and ALI predicted the outcome of patients with adenocarcinoma, whereas only the PNI predicted the outcome of patients with non-adenocarcinoma. The PNI and SII were the most useful indices in patients with a programmed death ligand-1 expression level of &lt;1% and \u22651%, respectively. The NLR, PLR, SII, PNI, ALI, and GPS were significantly associated with the outcome of Nivo-Ipi treatment in patients with NSCLC. The PNI was the most suitable marker regardless of histological type. The SII and PNI were the most promising markers for patients with and without PD-L1 expression, respectively.",

    "title": "Cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1: Its role in malignant progression and immunotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), also called CD279, is coded by the PDCD1 gene and is constitutively expressed on the surface of immune cells. As a receptor and immune checkpoint, PD-1 can bind to programmed death ligand-1/programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L1/PD-L2) in tumor cells, leading to tumor immune evasion. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 are important components in tumor immune therapy. PD-1 is also expressed as an intrinsic variant (iPD-1) in cancer cells where it plays important roles in malignant progression as proposed by recent studies. However, iPD-1 has received much less attention compared to PD-1 expressed on immune cells although there is an unmet medical need for fully elucidating the mechanisms of actions to achieve the best response in tumor immunotherapy. iPD-1 suppresses tumorigenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon cancer, whereas it promotes tumorigenesis in melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), thyroid cancer (TC), glioblastoma (GBM), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this review, we focus on the role of iPD-1 in tumorigenesis and development and its molecular mechanisms. We also deeply discuss nivolumab-based combined therapy in common tumor therapy. iPD-1 may explain the different therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 treatment and provide critical information for use in combined anti-tumor approaches.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of immunotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has resulted in a radical change in patients' treatment responses and survival rates. The increased percentage of long survivors, improved toxicity profiles compared to chemotherapy, and the possible applications for different NSCLC scenarios, have led to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) becoming the cornerstone of NSCLC treatment. Therefore, the objective of this review is to describe the current and future perspectives of NSCLC treatment. A systematic review according to the PRISMA criteria has been performed based on clinical trials with immunotherapy in NSCLC from the start of these treatments until June 2022. The use of ICIs is widespread across both first- and second-line treatments with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 drugs. New indications for immunotherapy in NSCLC have focused on adjuvant (atezolizumab) and neoadjuvant (nivolumab), with ICIs now present in all stages of NSCLC treatment. Given the promising results seen in clinical trials, new ICIs [anti- lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) or IDO1] currently under development, will soon be used as standard treatment for NSCLC. Immunotherapy is the mainstay of NSCLC treatment in all stages, including adjuvant, neoadjuvant and advanced tumors. The development of new molecules will revolutionize the treatment of NSCLC in the coming years.",

No studies have evaluated the re-immunotherapy regimen including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 antibody for lung cancer treatment. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of re-immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and/or anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibodies. We retrospectively reviewed patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC who received immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (without concomitant cytotoxic chemotherapy) between November 2020 and November 2022 at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center, Kyoto, Japan. Data were extracted from patients who had previously received immunotherapies with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Treatment responses and adverse events were evaluated. Of the 67 patients who received immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 23 were included in final analysis. The objective response rate was 17%, and the disease control rate was 48% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy. The highest grade of immune-related adverse events was grade 3, occurring in 11% of cases. Re-immunotherapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab after anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy may be feasible and provide clinical benefit in selected patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to identify the patient population that may benefit from re-immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, evidence regarding their relative efficacy and safety is lacking. This study compared the efficacy and safety of all currently available ICI treatments in patients with advanced NSCLC to identify optimal treatment regimens. PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 8, 2022. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). Forty RCTs involving 22,526 patients were selected, and a total of 26 treatment regimens were identified. Treatment with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) provided superior OS compared with anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) treatment. ICIs plus platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) were superior to ICIs treatment alone, although the addition of PBC increased treatment toxicity. Cemiplimab ranked first for OS and lowest for any-grade AEs in advanced NSCLC patients without PD-L1 selection. Regarding grade \u22653 AEs, the toxicity of ICI monotherapy or ICI-ICI combination was consistently lower than that of the other treatments. For patients without PD-L1 selection, cemiplimab showed the best OS, pembrolizumab plus docetaxel (Pem-DXT) showed the best PFS, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and PBC (Atezo-Beva-PBC) showed the best ORR. Pembrolizumab plus PBC and Atezo-Beva-PBC were the most likely optimal treatments for OS and PFS in patients with PD-L1 expression <1%, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 expression \u22651%, treatment regimens containing anti-PD-1 provided superior OS benefits compared with those of anti-PD-L1 treatment, and sintilimab plus PBC (Sint-PBC) provided the best OS benefit; as for PFS, ICI plus PBC consistently showed greater PFS benefits than ICI or PBC alone. For patients with anti-PD-L1 expression of 1-49%, camrelizumab plus PBC provided the best benefit for OS and PFS among included treatment. Durvalumab-tremelimumab-PBC and Atezo-Beva-PBC respectively presented the highest OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550%. Moreover, cemiplimab and Atezo-Beva-PBC yielded the best OS and PFS benefits as first-line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC, respectively. Although ICI plus PBC likely resulted in superior survival outcomes compared to ICI treatment alone, it did increase toxicity. Cemiplimab presented a well-balanced efficacy and safety profile in advanced NSCLC treatment. Our findings with the current ICIs comparisons will aid future trials for cancer immunotherapy.

This manuscript aims to evaluate the available data on atezolizumab (AT), cemiplimab (CEMI), and pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) and to study the results obtained during pivotal trials, especially regarding patient subgroups. Nominal group and Delphi techniques were used. Eight Spanish experts in lung cancer (the scientific committee of the project) analyzed the use of immunotherapy monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression. The expert scientific committee formulated several statements based on a scientific review and their own clinical experience. Subsequently, 17 additional Spanish lung cancer experts were selected to appraise the committee's statements through two Delphi rounds. They completed a Delphi round via an online platform and voted according to a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). The statements were approved if \u226570% of experts voted 7 or more. A total of 20 statements were proposed covering the following areas: (1) general characteristics of pivotal clinical trials; (2) overall main outcomes of pivotal clinical trials; and (3) subgroup analysis. All statements reached consensus in the first round. AT, CEMI, and PEMBRO as monotherapy can be considered the standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression (\u226550%). Moreover, some differences noted among the drugs analyzed in this document might facilitate treatment decision-making, especially in clinically relevant patient subgroups, when using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The high level of agreement reached among experts supports the proposed statements.",

Here, we aimed to summarise the outcomes of current NSCLC randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and explore the predictive value of TPS in clinical immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without chemotherapy. RCTs published by PubMed, Medline, Embase and Scopus before February 2023 comparing immunotherapy (PD-1/L1 with or without other therapy) versus a control group in advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included to assess the prognosis according to the patients' TPS with 1% and 50% as the thresholds. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. In total, 28 RCTs containing 17\u00a0266 participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included in this meta-analysis. Statistical results showed that compared with TPS <1%, \u22651% or within 1-49%, patients with TPS \u226550% benefited more significantly from the immunotherapy. A subgroup analysis showed that when TPS was <1%, \u22651% or within 1-49%, ICIs + chemotherapy had better efficacy than ICIs alone; PD-1 (such as pembrolizumab) inhibitors had better efficacy than PD-L1 inhibitors (such as atezolizumab).

Long-term effectiveness can be observed after initial progression, so we should carefully assess the response.",

    "abstract": "Since specific data on immunotherapy in older adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) are scarce, we designed this study to determine the overall survival (OS) at one year of first-line pembrolizumab in patients older than 70\u00a0years with aNSCLC expressing PD-L1. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, response rate, tolerability, quality of life (QoL) changes, and geriatric assessments. A single-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial was carried out by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group between February 2018 and November 2019 at ten active sites in Spain. We included patients 70\u00a0years old and older with histological or cytological documented stage IIIB or IV aNSCLC and PD-L1 expression\u00a0\u2265\u00a01%. Each subject received 200\u00a0mg of intravenous pembrolizumab every three weeks for a maximum of two years. 83 patients were recruited for the study and 74 were finally analysed. Most were male (N\u00a0=\u00a064, 86.5%) and former smokers (N\u00a0=\u00a051, 68.9%). 24 patients (32.4%) completed at least one year of treatment, 62 (83.7%) discontinued treatment, and 30 (40.5%) experienced disease progression. The median follow-up of our cohort was 18.0\u00a0months [range: 0.1-47.7] and 46 patients (62.2%) died during the period of study. The estimated OS at one year was 61.7% (95% CI: 49.6-71.8%) and the median OS of our cohort was 19.2\u00a0months (95% CI: 11.3-25.5). QoL tended to improve throughout the study, although the differences were not statistically significant. The main geriatric scores remained stable, except for a worsening in nutritional status (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and an improvement in frailty (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). Our results support treating older adults with aNSCLC expressing PD-L1 with pembrolizumab in monotherapy. The stability of most geriatric scores and the positive trend on the patients' QoL should be highlighted, although our results did not reach statistical significance.",

We report results in Japanese patients with\u2009\u2265\u20095-year follow-up. Adults with stage IV/recurrent NSCLC without EGFR/ALK aberrations were randomized 1:1:1 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab alone, or chemotherapy (patients with tumor PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u20091%), or nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy (patients with tumor PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%). Five-year efficacy and safety were assessed in Japanese patients. At 62.1\u00a0months' minimum follow-up, 143 Japanese patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u20091% or\u2009<\u20091% were randomized to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n\u2009=\u200966) or chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u200977). Five-year OS rates were 46% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 34% with chemotherapy (PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u20091%) and 36% versus 19% (PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%).

No new safety signals were observed. At 5-year follow-up, nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to show long-term durable clinical benefit versus chemotherapy, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Consistent with findings for the global population, these data support the use of nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first-line treatment in Japanese patients with metastatic NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "In this phase Ib/II open-label study, tumor immune suppression was targeted in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors and patients with recurrent/refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using galunisertib with nivolumab. Eligible patients were\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years old, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status\u2009\u2264\u20091, and were treatment-naive for anti-programmed cell death-1, its ligand, or transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor 1 kinase inhibitors. Phase Ib was an open-label, dose-escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of galunisertib with nivolumab in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. Phase II evaluated the safety of galunisertib with nivolumab in NSCLC patients who had received prior platinum-based treatment but were immuno-oncology agent-naive. This trial was conducted between October 2015 and August 2020. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in phase I. In the phase II NSCLC cohort (n\u2009=\u200925), patients received 150\u00a0mg twice daily galunisertib (14\u00a0days on/14\u00a0days off dosing schedule for all phases) plus nivolumab at 3\u00a0mg/kg (intravenously every 2\u00a0weeks). In this phase, the most frequent treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were pruritus (n\u2009=\u20099, 36%), fatigue (n\u2009=\u20098, 32%), and decreased appetite (n\u2009=\u20097, 28%). No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related AEs were observed. Six (24%) patients had confirmed partial response (PR) and 4 (16%) had stable disease; 1 additional patient had confirmed PR after initial pseudo-progression. The median duration of response was 7.43\u00a0months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.75, NR). Among the 7 responders, including the delayed responder, 1 had high PD-L1 expression (\u2265\u200950%). The median progression-free survival was 5.26\u00a0months (95% CI: 1.77, 9.20) and the median overall survival was 11.99\u00a0months (95% CI: 8.15, NR). Interferon gamma response genes were induced post-treatment and cell adhesion genes were repressed, although the association of these observations with tumor response and clinical outcomes was not statistically powered due to limited samples available. The study met its primary endpoint as galunisertib combined with nivolumab was well tolerated. Preliminary efficacy was observed in a subset of patients in the Phase 2 NSCLC cohort. Trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02423343; 22.04.2015).",

To clarify the association of a history of concurrent medication use with treatment outcomes for ICIs with or without chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC with a high PD-L1 TPS and to determine whether these clinical histories are biomarkers for appropriate treatment selection. This retrospective, multicenter cohort study at 13 hospitals in Japan included patients with advanced NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or more who had received pembrolizumab ICI monotherapy or ICI plus chemotherapy as the initial treatment between March 2017 and December 2020. The median (IQR) follow-up duration was 18.5 (9.2-31.2) months. Data were analyzed from April 2022 through May 2023. ICI monotherapy with pembrolizumab or ICI plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment. The primary analysis was the association of treatment outcomes with baseline patient characteristics, including concomitant drug history, after propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the associations of patient characteristics with survival outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of concomitant medication history with treatment outcomes and other patient characteristics. A total of 425 patients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study including 271 patients (median [range] age, 72 [43-90] years; 215 [79%] men) who were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy as the first-line treatment and 154 patients (median [range] age, 69 [36-86] years; 121 [79%] men) who were treated with ICI plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. In multivariable analysis, a history of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was independently associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in the pembrolizumab monotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.91; P\u2009=\u2009.048), but not in the ICI plus chemotherapy group.

Tumor progression was verified through radiologic review, while toxicity was captured from records. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a095) caused higher rates of adverse events (91% vs. 51%, P < .001), treatment discontinuation (37% vs. 21%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.034), and hospitalization (56% vs. 23%, P < .001), but similar rates of immune-related adverse events (irAEs, mean 35%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.998) compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a061). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar between the 2 groups (7 vs. 8 months, and 16 vs. 14 months in median, P > .25).

    "abstract": "Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET amplification primarily relies on MET inhibitors for treatment, but once resistance occurs, the available treatment options are limited and the prognosis is typically poor. A 57-year-old man with advanced NSCLC and C-MET amplification was initially treated with crizotinib but developed progressive disease. After the antirotinib treatment, he achieved a partial response for a year. Genetic testing showed high PD-L1 expression, and he was treated with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy for 3\u00a0months, with partial response. Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab and local I-125 seeds brachytherapy (ISB) was given after the lung lesion progressed but other lesions remained stable. The therapy resulted in significant resolution of the right upper lung lesion. It demonstrates the effectiveness of ISB-ICI combination in treating MET amplification advanced NSCLC. Ongoing research and treatment innovation are important in managing advanced NSCLC with complex genetic aberrations. To explore the candidate mechanism of ISB therapy response, we download public genetic data and conduct different expression Lncrnas analysis and pathway analysis to discover radiotherapy related sensitive or resistance lncRNAs and pathways, we found that AL654754.1 is a key lncRNA with radiotherapy response, and it also include in classical p53 and Wnt signaling pathway. Overall, the clinical case reports, combined with the exploration of underlying mechanisms, provide positive guidance for the precise treatment of lung cancer.",

The treatment response was assessed via RECIST 1.1 using the baseline and first follow-up CT. Associations between the baseline variables and progressive disease (PD) were tested by logistic regression analyses. The results showed 46/138 patients had PD. The baseline CT \"number of involved organs\" by metastasis and smoking pack years were independently associated with PD (",

    "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapy was compared to single-agent pembrolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PDL1 > 50% in KEYNOTE-024. In this trial, it was found that patients who received single-agent pembrolizumab had improved progression-free survival in addition to overall survival (OS). Based on KEYNOTE-024, only 53% of patients treated originally with pembrolizumab received second-line anticancer systemic therapy with an OS of 26.3 months. Based on these results, the objective of this study was to characterize real-world NSCLC patients who received second-line therapy after single-agent pembrolizumab. This was a retrospective cohort study considering stage IV NSCLC patients diagnosed with BC Cancer between 2018 and 2021 with PD-L1 \u2265 50% who received first-line single agent pembrolizumab. Patient demographics, cancer history, treatment administered, and survival were collected retrospectively. Descriptive statistics were produced. OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log rank test. A multivariate model evaluated characteristics associated with the receipt of second-line therapy. A total of 718 patients were diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC and received at least one cycle of pembrolizumab. The median duration of treatment was 4.4 months, and the follow-up duration was 16.0 months. There were 567 (79%) patients who had disease progression, of whom 21% received second-line systemic therapy. Within the subset of patients with disease progression, the median duration of treatment was 3.0 months. It would be found that patients who received second-line therapy had better baseline ECOG performance status, were younger at diagnosis, and had a longer duration of pembrolizumab. Within the full population, the OS from the treatment initiation date was 14.0 months. OS was 5.6 months in patients who did not receive additional therapy after progression and 22.2 months in patients who received subsequent therapy. Baseline ECOG performance status was associated with improved OS in multivariate analysis. Based on this real-world Canadian population, 21% of patients received second-line systemic therapy, despite second-line therapy being associated with prolonged survival. In this real-world population, we found that 60% fewer patients received second-line systemic therapy when compared to KEYNOTE-024. Although differences always exist when comparing a clinical and non-clinical trial population, our findings suggest undertreating stage IV NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "There is an unmet need to identify novel predictive biomarkers that enable more accurate identification of individuals who can benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. The US FDA recently approved tumor mutational burden (TMB) score of \u2265\u200910 mut/Mb as a threshold for pembrolizumab treatment of solid tumors. Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that specific gene mutation signature may predict the efficacy of ICI therapy more precisely than high TMB (\u2265\u200910). We selected 20 candidate genes that may predict for the efficacy of ICI therapy by the analysis of data from a published cohort of 350 advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Then, we compared the influences of various gene mutation signatures on the efficacy of ICI treatment. They were also compared with PD-L1 and TMB. The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to evaluate the prognosis univariates, while selected univariates were adopted to develop a systematic nomogram. A high mutation signature, where three or more of the 20 selected genes were mutated, was associated with the significant benefits of ICI therapy. Specifically, patients with high mutation signature were confirmed to have better prognosis for ICI treatment, compared with those with wild type (the median PFS: 7.17 vs. 2.90 months, p\u2009=\u20090.0004, HR\u2009=\u20090.47 (95% [CI]:0.32-0.68); the median OS: unreached vs. 9 months, p\u2009=\u20091.8E-8, HR\u2009=\u20090.17 (95% [CI]:0.11-0.25)). Moreover, those patients with the high mutation signature achieved significant ICI treatment benefits, while there was no difference of OS and PFS between patients without the signature but TMB-H (\u2265\u200910) and those without the signature and low TMB(<\u200910). Finally, we constructed a novel nomogram to evaluate the efficacy of ICI therapy. A high mutational signature with 3 or more of the 20-gene panel could provide more accurate predictions for the outcomes of ICI therapy than TMB\u2009\u2265\u200910 in NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "The high expression of programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a valid biological indicator of the therapeutic benefit of pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the response rate of NSCLC patients with positive PD-L1 expression to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is still low. From January 2019 to January 2021, a retrospective study was conducted at the Fujian Medical University Xiamen Humanity Hospital. In total, 143 patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the efficacy of the treatment [complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), or progression disease (PD)] was evaluated. Patients with a CR and PR were defined as an objective response (OR) group (n=67), and the other patients were defined as a control group (n=76). The differences in the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and clinical features between the 2 groups were compared, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the value of ctDNA in predicting the failure to achieve an OR after immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, and a multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyze the factors affecting the OR after immunotherapy in NSCLC patients. R4.0.3 statistical software (Ross Ihaka Robert Gentleman, New Zealand) was used to establish and verify the prediction model of OR after immunotherapy in NSCLC patients. CtDNA was valuable in predicting the non-OR of patients with NSCLC after immunotherapy, and the area under the curve was 0.750 [95% CI: 0.673-0.828, P<0.001]. CtDNA <3.72 ng/\u00b5L can be used to predict which NSCLC patients will achieve objective remission after immunotherapy (P<0.001). Based on the regression model, a prediction model was established. The data set was randomly divided into the training set and validation set. The sample size of the training set was 72 and that of the validation set was 71. The area under the ROC curve of the training set was 0.850 (95% CI: 0.760-0.940), and that of the validation set was 0.732 (95% CI: 0.616-0.847).

    "title": "Traditional Treatment Approaches and Role of Immunotherapy in Lung Malignancy and Mesothelioma.",
    "abstract": "There is no denying that many revolutions took place in the fight against cancer during the last decades. However, cancers have always managed to find new ways to challenge humankinds. Variable genomic epidemiology, socio-economic differences and limitations of widespread screening are the major concerns in cancer diagnosis and early treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is essentially to manage a cancer patient efficiently. Thoracic malignancies including lung cancers and pleural mesothelioma are accountable for little more than 11.6% of the global cancer burden [4]. Mesothelioma is one of the rare cancers, but concern is the incidences are increasing globally. However, the good news is first-line chemotherapy with the combination of immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma has showed promising respond and improved overall survival (OS) in pivotal clinical trials [10]. ICIs are commonly referred as immunotherapy are antigens on the cancer cells, and inhibitors are the antibodies produce by the T cell defence system. By inhibiting immune checkpoints, the cancer cells become visible to be identified as abnormal cells and attack by the body's defence system [17]. The programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are commonly used immune checkpoint blockers for\u00a0anti-cancer treatment. PD-1/PD-L1 are proteins produced by immune cells and mimic by cancer cells that are implicated in inhibiting T cell response to regulate our immune system, which results tumour cells escaping the defence mechanism to achieve immune surveillance. Therefore, inhibiting immune checkpoints as well as monoclonal antibodies can lead to effective apoptosis of tumour cells [17]. Mesothelioma is an industrial disease caused by significant asbestos exposure. It is the cancer of the mesothelial tissue which presents in the lining of the mediastinum of pleura, pericardium and peritoneum, most commonly affected sites are pleura of the lung or chest wall lining [9] as route of asbestos exposure is inhalation. Calretinin is a calcium binding protein, typically over exposed in malignant mesotheliomas and the most useful marker even while initial changes take place [5]. On the other hand, Wilm's tumour 1 (WT-1) gene expression on the tumour cells can be related to prognosis as it can elicit immune response, thereby inhibit cell apoptosis. A systematic review and meta-analysis study conducted by Qi et al. has suggested that expression of WT-1 in a solid tumour is fatal however, it gives the tumour cell a feature of immune sensitivity which then acts positively towards the treatment with immunotherapy. Clinical significance of WT-1 oncogene in treatment is still hugely debatable and needs further attention [21]. Recently, Japan has reinstated Nivolumab in patients with chemo-refractory mesothelioma. According to NCCN guidelines, the salvage therapies include Pembrolizumab in PD-L1 positive patients and Nivolumab alone or with Ipilimumab in cancers irrespective of PD-L1 expression [9]. The checkpoint blockers have taken over the biomarker-based research and demonstrated impressive treatment options in immune sensitive and asbestos-related cancers. It can be expected that in near future the immune checkpoint inhibitors will be considered as approved first-line cancer treatment universally.",

Although single-agent pembrolizumab has also demonstrated some activity in this setting, no reliable biomarkers yet exist for selecting patients likely to respond to single-agent immunotherapy. The main purpose of the study was to identify potential new biomarkers associated with progression-free-survival (PFS) within a multiomics analysis. PEOPLE (NTC03447678) was a prospective phase II trial evaluating first-line pembrolizumab in patients with advanced EGFR and ALK wild type treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC with PD-L1 <50%. Circulating immune profiling was performed by determination of absolute cell counts with multiparametric flow cytometry on freshly isolated whole blood samples at baseline and at first radiological evaluation. Gene expression profiling was performed using nCounter PanCancer IO 360 Panel (NanoString) on baseline tissue. Gut bacterial taxonomic abundance was obtained by shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples at baseline. Omics data were analyzed with sequential univariate Cox proportional hazards regression predicting PFS, with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction. Biological features significant with univariate analysis were analyzed with multivariate least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). From May 2018 to October 2020, 65 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up and PFS were 26.4 and 2.9 months, respectively. LASSO integration analysis, with an optimal lambda of 0.28, showed that peripheral blood natural killer cells/CD56dimCD16+ (HR 0.56, 0.41-0.76, p=0.006) abundance at baseline and non-classical CD14dimCD16+monocytes (HR 0.52, 0.36-0.75, p=0.004), eosinophils (CD15+CD16-) (HR 0.62, 0.44-0.89, p=0.03) and lymphocytes (HR 0.32, 0.19-0.56, p=0.001) after first radiologic evaluation correlated with favorable PFS as well as high baseline expression levels of CD244 (HR 0.74, 0.62-0.87, p=0.05) protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (HR 0.55, 0.38-0.81, p=0.098) and killer cell lectin like receptor B1 (HR 0.76, 0.66-0.89, p=0.05).

No microbiome features were selected. This multiomics approach was able to identify immune cell subsets and expression levels of genes associated to PFS in patients with PD-L1 <50% NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab. These preliminary data will be confirmed in the larger multicentric international I3LUNG trial (NCT05537922). 2017-002841-31.",

    "abstract": "The response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) often differs between genders in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but metanalyses results are controversial, and no clear mechanisms are defined. We aim at clarifying the molecular circuitries explaining the differential gender-related response to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents in NSCLC. We prospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with NSCLC treated with ICI as a first-line approach, and we identified the molecular mechanisms determining the differential efficacy of ICI in 29 NSCLC cell lines of both genders, recapitulating patients' phenotype. We validated new immunotherapy strategies in mice bearing NSCLC patient-derived xenografts and human reconstituted immune system (\"immune-PDXs\"). In patients, we found that estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) was a predictive factor of response to pembrolizumab, stronger than gender and PD-L1 levels, and was directly correlated with PD-L1 expression, particularly in female patients. ER\u03b1 transcriptionally upregulated CD274/PD-L1 gene, more in females than in males. This axis was activated by 17-\u03b2-estradiol, autocrinely produced by intratumor aromatase, and by the EGFR-downstream effectors Akt and ERK1/2 that activated ER\u03b1. The efficacy of pembrolizumab in immune-PDXs was significantly improved by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, which reduced PD-L1 and increased the percentage of antitumor CD8+T-lymphocytes, NK cells, and V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-lymphocytes, producing durable control and even tumor regression after continuous administration, with maximal benefit in 17-\u03b2-estradiol/ER\u03b1 highfemale immune-xenografts. Our work unveils that 17-\u03b2-estradiol/ER\u03b1 status predicts the response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC. Second, we propose aromatase inhibitors as new gender-tailored immune-adjuvants in NSCLC. See related commentary by Valencia et al., p. 3832.",

    "abstract": "The neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is being increasingly adopted, but questions about the most appropriate applications remain. Although patients with resectable NSCLC are often treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapies +/- radiotherapy, they still have a high risk of recurrence and death. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4) have provided a new and effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Therefore, it is possible that ICIs for early-stage NSCLC may follow the pattern established in metastatic disease. Currently, there are several ongoing trials to determine the efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with local or regional disease. To date, only nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved by the U.S. FDA in the preoperative setting, but data continue to evolve rapidly, and treatment guidelines need to be determined. In this article, we review the current preclinical and clinical evidence on neoadjuvant ICIs alone and combination in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy is a standard first-line treatment for PD-L1-high advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without actionable genomic alterations (AGA). However, few patients experience long-term disease control, highlighting the need for more effective therapies. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a novel trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, showed encouraging safety and antitumor activity with pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC. We describe the rationale and design of TROPION-Lung08, a phase III study evaluating safety and efficacy of first-line Dato-DXd plus pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC without AGAs and with PD-L1 tumor proportion score \u226550%. Primary end points are progression-free survival and overall survival; secondary end points include objective response rate, duration of response, safety\u00a0and presence of antidrug antibodies.  More than half of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed when their tumor is advanced (unlikely to be cured with currently available treatments) or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body). These patients have poor survival outcomes. NSCLCs can grow by using a protein called PD-L1 to escape from the immune system. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy that targets PD-1, the protein on immune cells that detects PD-L1. Because of this, pembrolizumab prevents the tumor from escaping the immune system by blocking the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1. Patients whose NSCLC tumors express PD-L1 often respond to pembrolizumab at first but, for most of these patients, their cancer eventually comes back. An investigational drug called datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a type of therapy called an antibody\u2013drug conjugate that delivers chemotherapy to tumors using an antibody. The antibody in Dato-DXd is directed against a protein called TROP2, which is commonly expressed by tumor cells. Results from early studies show that combining pembrolizumab with Dato-DXd may work well for patients with solid tumors, including NSCLC. This study will look at the benefits and side effects of Dato-DXd added to pembrolizumab compared with pembrolizumab alone as a first treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC and high levels of PD-L1.",

Accordingly, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in treatment of first line NSCLC and to select individuals with the greatest potential benefit from pembrolizumab therapy, in order to obtain a more accurate treatment of NSCLC in immunotherapy. Mainstream oncology datasets and conferences were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published before August 2022. RCTs involved individuals with first line NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The basic characteristics of the included studies were recorded, along with 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) and hazard ratios (HR) for all patients and subgroups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints was progression-free survival (PFS). Pooled treatment data were estimated using the inverse variance-weighted method. Five RCTs involving 2,877 individuals were included in the study. Pembrolizumab-based therapy significantly improved OS (HR 0.66; CI 95%, 0.55-0.79; p\u2009<\u20090.00001) and PFS (HR 0.60; CI 95%, 0.40-0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.02) compared with chemotherapy. OS was substantially enhanced in individuals aged\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years (HR 0.59; CI 95%, 0.42-0.82; p\u2009=\u20090.002), males (HR 0.74; CI 95%, 0.65-0.83; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), with a smoking history (HR 0.65; CI 95%, 0.52-0.82; p\u2009=\u20090.0003), with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS)\u2009<\u20091% (HR 0.55; CI 95%, 0.41-0.73; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and TPS\u2009\u2265\u200950% (HR 0.66; CI 95%, 0.56-0.76; p\u2009<\u20090.00001), but not in individuals aged\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years (HR 0.82; CI 95%, 0.56-1.21; p\u2009=\u20090.32), females (HR 0.57; CI 95%, 0.31-1.06; p\u2009=\u20090.08), never smokers (HR 0.57; CI 95%, 0.18-1.80; p\u2009=\u20090.34), or with TPS 1-49% (HR 0.72; CI 95%, 0.52-1.01; p\u2009=\u20090.06). Pembrolizumab significantly prolonged OS in NSCLC patients, regardless of histology type (squamous or non-squamous NSCLC), performance status (PS) (0 or 1), and brain metastatic status (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy had more favorable HR values than pembrolizumab monotherapy in improving the OS of individuals with different clinical and molecular features. Pembrolizumab-based therapy is a valuable option for first line treating advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Age, sex, smoking history and PD-L1 expression status can be used to predict the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab. Cautiousness was needed when using pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years, females, never smokers, or in patients with TPS 1-49%. Furthermore, pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment regimen.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most common causes of death in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain metastases (BM) have attracted attention and debate about treatment options, especially for patients with negative driver genes or resistance to targeted agents. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the potential benefit of different therapeutic regimens for intracranial lesions in non-targeted therapy NSCLC patients. A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoints included the intracerebral objective response rate (icORR) and intracerebral progression-free survival (iPFS) in patients with BM. Thirty-six studies involving 1,774 NSCLC patients with baseline BM were included in this meta-analysis. Antitumor agents plus radiotherapy (RT) showed the most significant synergistic effects; the highest pooled icORR that appeared in the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and RT was 81% [95% confidence interval (CI): 16-100%], and the median iPFS was 7.04 months (95% CI: 2.54-11.55 months). The pooled icORR and median iPFS of RT plus chemotherapy were 46% (95% CI: 34-57%) and 5.7 months (95% CI: 3.90-7.50 months), respectively. The highest median iPFS in nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was 13.5 months (95% CI: 8.35-18.65 months). ICI plus chemotherapy also showed potent antitumor activity in BM, with a pooled icORR of 56% (95% CI: 29-82%) and a median iPFS of 6.9 months (95% CI: 3.20-10.60 months). Notably, the subgroup analysis indicated that the pooled icORR of patients in programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (\u226550%) who received ICI was 54% (95% CI: 30-77%), and that of patients who received first-line ICI was 69.0% (95% CI: 51-85%). ICI-based combination treatment provides a long-term survival benefit for non-targeted therapy patients, with the most significant benefits observed in improving icORR and prolonging overall survival (OS) and iPFS. In particular, patients who received first-line treatment or who were PD-L1-positive had a more significant survival benefit from aggressive ICI-based therapies. For patients with a PD-L1-negative status, chemotherapy plus RT led to better clinical outcomes than other treatment regimens. These innovative findings could help clinicians to better select therapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients with BM.",

    "abstract": "Many trials supported pembrolizumab as a first-line monotherapy to significantly improve overall survival (OS) in selected patients with previously untreated metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (mNSCLC) and a PD-L1 TPS of \u226550% without EGFR/ALK mutations. The aim of this study was to reveal the correlation between OS and adverse events in real-world settings after 42\u2009months. This retrospective observational study involved 98 patients with mNSCLC, TPS\u2009\u2265\u200950%, and no EGFR/ALK aberrations. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab (200\u2009mg q3w) as a first-line treatment. Clinical data, including PD-L1 expression, Performance Status (ECOG-PS), treatment duration, toxicity, and outcomes were retrieved from local electronic medical records and from the Italian Regulatory Agency Registry. The cohort's main characteristics were as follows: median age 73 [44-89] years, 64.3% were male and 35.7% were female, an ECOG-PS score of 0 (n\u2009=\u200973) and 1 or 2 (n\u2009=\u200925), and a PD-L1\u2009>\u200990% in 29.6% of patients. The entire cohort had stage IV NSCLC at diagnosis. The median number of cycles was 8.5 at a median follow-up of 13\u2009months. The median OS of 13.6\u2009months (95% CI: 11.7-NA) was not influenced by sex and PD-L1, but was significantly associated with ECOG-PS (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs) occurred in 77.5% of patients (30.1% cutaneous, 27.5% gastrointestinal, and 20.4% endocrinological), but no grade 4 or 5 irAEs were identified. Patients experiencing any type of toxicity had a significantly longer median OS (20.39\u2009months, 95% CI: 13.08-NA) than those with no toxicities (6.46\u2009months, 95% CI: 1.41-NA, p\u2009=\u20090.006). The percentage of irAEs detected was comparable to that reported in KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042. These real-world findings demonstrated the significant correlation between OS and cutaneous toxicities.",

    "title": "Cost-effectiveness of first-line immunotherapy combinations with or without chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a modelling approach.",
    "abstract": "Many studies have explored the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. However, there is paucity of evidence on direct pharmacoeconomic studies related to immunotherapy combinations. Thus, we aimed at assessing the economic outcomes of first-line immunotherapy combinations in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Chinese health care perspective. The mutual hazard ratios (HRs) of ten immunotherapy combinations and one chemotherapy regimen for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Based on proportional hazard (PH) assumption, adjusted OS and PFS curves were established to make the effects comparable. With the parameters of cost and utility, and of scale and shape from the fit of adjusted OS and PFS curves obtained from previous studies, a partitioned survival model was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy combinations versus chemotherapy alone. Parameter uncertainty in model inputs was assessed using one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone was $13,180.65, the lowest among all the other immunotherapy combinations. Furthermore, sintilimab plus chemotherapy (sint-chemo) provided the highest quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) benefit versus chemotherapy alone (incremental QALYs\u2009=\u20090.45). Sint-chemo yielded the best incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) versus chemotherapy alone (ICER\u2009=\u2009$34,912.09/QALY), at the current price. The cost-effectiveness probabilities were 32.01% and 93.91% for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, respectively (if the original price of the pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab were decreased by 90%). Based on the fact that there is fierce competition in the PD-1/PD-L1 market, pharmaceutical enterprises should strive for greater efficacy, and optimal pricing strategy for therapies.",

    "abstract": "Often, patients with NSCLC experience recurrent/refractory (R/R) disease within 2 years of chemoradiation (CRT) and consolidative durvalumab. Despite prior immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure, immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy is typically initiated if a driver-oncogene is absent. However, there remains a paucity of data regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy in this patient population. Here, we present survival outcomes associated with pembrolizumab for R/R NSCLC. We retrospectively assessed adults with NSCLC who received pembrolizumab for R/R disease between January 2016 to January 2023. Primary objective was to estimate OS and PFS in this cohort compared to historical outcomes. Secondary objective was to compare OS and PFS among subgroups. Fifty patients were evaluated. Median follow-up time was 11.3 months (2.9-38.2). OS was 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.8-19.2); 1-year OS rate 49% (95% CI, 36 - 67%). PFS was 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.7-9.0); 1-year PFS rate 25% (95% CI, 15%-42%). Current smokers had significantly better median OS/PFS as compared to former smokers (NA vs. 10.5 and 9.9 vs. 6.0 months, respectively). The addition of chemotherapy demonstrated an OS benefit (median OS 12.9 vs. 6.0 months) but was not statistically significant. Patients with R/R NSCLC represent a distinct cohort with inferior survival outcomes when compared to those with de novo stage IV disease treated with pembrolizumab-based regimens. Based on our findings, we recommend oncologists exercise caution when considering checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in the front-line setting for R/R NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Surgery is the most potentially curative therapeutic option for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The five-year survival for these patients remains poor and variable, depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, and the risk of recurrence following tumor resection is high. During the last 20 years, there has been a modest improvement in the therapeutic strategies for resectable NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have become the cornerstone for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients. Recently, their clinical development has been shifted in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings where they have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Based on the positive results from phase III trials, ICIs have become a therapeutic option in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. On October 2021 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atezolizumab as an adjuvant treatment following surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 \u2265 1%. In March 2022, nivolumab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was approved for adult patients with resectable NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting. The current review provides an updated overview of the clinical trials exploring the role of immunotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC, focusing on the biological rationale for their use in the perioperative setting. We will also discuss the role of potential predictive biomarkers to personalize therapy and optimize the incorporation of immunotherapy into the multimodality management of stage I-III NSCLC.",

To clinically validate a TMB biomarker from a next-generation sequencing targeted gene panel assay. A prespecified cohort study using the deidentified clinicogenomic Tempus database of patients sequenced between 2018 and 2022, which contained retrospective, observational data originating from 300 cancer sites including 199 community sites and 101 academic sites. Patients with advanced solid tumors across 8 cancer types and more than 20 histologies, sequenced with Tempus xT who were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the first-line or second-line setting were included. Data were analyzed from September 2018 to August 2022. Treatment with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiprogrammed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) ICI and/or in combination with a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 ICI. The primary outcome was the association of tumor mutational burden (TMB) binary category (high [\u226510 mut/mb] vs low) with overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ICIs. Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), and time to progression (TTP). In the evaluable cohort of 674 patients, the median (IQR) age was 69.4 (28.6-89.8) years, 271 patients (40.2%) were female, and 435 patients (64.5%) were White. The most common advanced cancers were non-small cell lung cancer (330 patients [49.0%]), followed by bladder cancer (148 patients [22.0%]), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (96 patients [14.8%]). Median (IQR) follow-up was 7.2 (3.2-14.1) months. High TMB (TMB-H) cancers (206 patients [30.6%]) were significantly associated with longer OS than low TMB (TMB-L) cancers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; upper confidence bound [UCB], 0.91; P\u2009=\u2009.01).

    "abstract": "In lung cancer, overexpression of nuclear export proteins can result in inactivation of critical tumor suppressor proteins and cell-cycle regulators. Selective suppression of nuclear export proteins has immunomodulatory activities. Here, clinical safety and early efficacy data are presented on the combination of pembrolizumab and an oral selective nuclear export inhibitor, selinexor, for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). The primary objective of this prospective investigator-initiated study was to determine the safety and tolerability of selinexor in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with mNSCLC. Secondary objectives included determination of objective tumor response rate, disease control rate, and progression-free survival duration. A total of 17 patients were included in the final analysis. Fifteen (88%) received more than two lines of prior systemic therapy and 10 (59%) had prior exposure to anti-PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy. The median age was 67.5\u00a0years. Ten patients had grade \u22653 adverse events related to selinexor treatment. Responses to treatment occurred in patients who did and did not undergo previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and in patients with activating driver mutations. The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 11.4\u00a0months (95% CI, 3.4-19.8\u00a0months) and 3.0\u00a0months (95% CI, 1.7-5.7\u00a0months), respectively. The overall response rate was 18% and the 6-month disease control rate was 24%. Selinexor in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with mNSCLC, including those who had previously received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The therapy-related toxic effects were consistent with the prior safety data for both drugs, and no overlapping toxic effects were observed. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02419495. New strategies to prevent or reverse resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are under investigation. Selective inhibitors of nuclear export proteins, such as selinexor, can induce restoration of tumor-suppressing pathways and induce potent immunomodulatory activities.

The study included 133 patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Serial CT scans during therapy were assessed for tumor burden dynamics during therapy, which were studied for the association with OS. There were 67 responders, with overall response rate of 50%. The tumor burden change at the best overall response ranged from\u2009-\u2009100.0% to\u2009+\u2009132.1% (median of\u2009-\u200930%). Higher response rates were associated with younger age (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and higher programmed cell death-1 (PD-L1) expression levels (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Eighty-three patients (62%) showed tumor burden below the baseline burden throughout therapy. Using an 8-week landmark analysis, OS was longer in patients with tumor burden below the baseline burden in the first 8\u00a0weeks than in those who experienced\u2009\u2265\u20090% increase (median OS: 26.8 vs. 7.6\u00a0months, hazard ratio (HR): 0.36, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Tumor burden remained below their baseline throughout therapy was associated with significantly reduced hazards of death (HR: 0.72, p\u2009=\u20090.03) in the extended Cox models, after adjusting for other clinical variables. Pseudoprogression was noted in only one patient (0.8%). Tumor burden staying below the baseline burden throughout the therapy was predictive of prolonged overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and may be used as a practical marker for therapeutic decisions in this widely used combination regimen. The analysis of tumor burden dynamics on serial CT scans in reference to the baseline burden can provide an additional objective guide for treatment decision making in patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for their advanced NSCLC. \u2022 Tumor burden remaining below baseline burden during therapy predicted longer survival during first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. \u2022 Pseudoprogression was noted in 0.8%, demonstrating the rarity of the phenomenon. \u2022 Tumor burden dynamics may serve as an objective marker for treatment benefit to guide treatment decisions during first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.",

We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC who received antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor monotherapy (nivolumab) from December 22, 2015, to May 31, 2017.

    "abstract": "Since July 2017, pembrolizumab has been approved as a first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a PD-L1 score \u2265 50% in Quebec. Study objectives were to describe and assess the real-world use of pembrolizumab; report progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immune-related adverse events (IRAEs); and compare outcomes between a fixed dose (FD) and a weight-based capped dose (WCD). Medical records of patients treated in one of Quebec's four adult university teaching hospitals who received pembrolizumab between 1 November 2017 and 31 October 2019 were reviewed and followed until 29 February 2020. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were included. The median real-world PFS and OS were 9.4 (95% CI, 6.6 to 11.2) and 17.3 months (95% CI, 12.9 to not reached), respectively. IRAEs causing delays or treatment interruptions were seen in 34.4% of patients. Initiating treatment with a FD (49 patients) or using a WCD (230 patients) does not appear to affect PFS, OS, or the occurrence of IRAEs. The use of a WCD strategy allowed approximately CAD 5.8 million in savings during the course of our study. These findings support the effectiveness and safety of pembrolizumab in a real-world setting. The use of a WCD does not appear to have a negative impact on patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for various types of malignancy, including non-small-cell lung cancer, have improved prognosis in some cases. Granuloma formation after ICI administration suggests a tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response with abundant interferon-gamma production, which can be used to estimate the curative effect of ICIs. In this report, we present a case with a resected lung lesion, clinically suspected to be lung cancer, that consisted of a granulomatous lesion. A tumor was also found in the duodenum that was presumed to be derived from the pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. Duodenal tumor cells highly expressed PD-L1, suggesting PD-1/PD-L1 axis-mediated immune escape. As expected, pembrolizumab induced a complete response for the duodenal lesion. Interestingly, in histopathological analysis, the duodenal lesion was also replaced by an epithelial granuloma and multinucleated giant cells. We conclude that autoimmunity regressed the untreated primary lung lesion spontaneously, while the metastatic duodenal lesion responded to PD-1 blockade. Tumor-associated epithelioid granulomas, even before ICI administration, may be an important pathological finding indicating an immune response with interferon-gamma production by cytotoxic T cells to the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly improved survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ICIs are increasingly used in combination with cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy. Although combined treatments are more effective, not all patients respond to the therapy; therefore, a detailed understanding of the effect of treatment combinations at the tumour level is needed. The present study aimed to explore whether ICIs could affect the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy on lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with different PD-L1 expression levels (high, HCC-44; low, A-549). Using the resazurin-based assay, the efficacy of seven chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, etoposide, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, docetaxel and paclitaxel) was compared in the presence or absence of the individually chosen single doses of four ICIs (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab). The results revealed that different ICIs can exhibit either potentiating or depotentiating effects, depending on the chemotherapy agent or lung adenocarcinoma cell line used. Durvalumab was the most promising ICI, which potentiated most chemotherapy agents in both cell lines, especially in the case of high PD-L1 expression. By contrast, nivolumab, exhibited depotentiating trends in several combinations. The immunostaining of \u03b3H2AX in treated cells confirmed that the potentiation of the chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity by durvalumab was at least partially mediated via increased DNA damage; however, this effect was strongly dependent on the chemotherapy agent and cell line used. Our future studies aim to address the specific mechanisms underlying the observed ICI-induced potentiation or depotentiation.",

Thus new therapies are under investigation, such as anti-TIGIT [anti-T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains] antibodies. TIGIT is an immune checkpoint inhibiting lymphocyte T cells by several mechanisms. In\u00a0vitro models showed its inhibition could restore antitumor response. Furthermore, its association with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies could synergistically improve survival. We carried out a review of the clinical trial about TIGIT referenced in the PubMed database, finding three published clinical trials on anti-TIGIT therapies. Vibostolimab was evaluated in a phase I alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. The combination had an objective response rate of 26% in patients with a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) na\u00efve of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1). Etigilimab was tested in a phase I alone or in combination with nivolumab, but the study was stopped due to business reasons. In the phase II CITYSCAPE trial, tiragolumab demonstrated higher objective response rate and progression-free survival in combination with atezolizumab than atezolizumab alone in advanced PD-L1-high NSCLC. The ClinicalTrials.gov database references 70 trials of anti-TIGIT in patients with cancer, 47 of them with ongoing recruitment. Only seven were phase III, including five about patients with NSCLC, mostly with combination therapy. Data from phase I-II trials highlighted that targeting TIGIT represents a safe therapeutic approach, with an acceptable toxicity profile maintained when adding anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. Frequent adverse events were pruritus, rash, and fatigue. Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in nearly one in three patients. Anti-TIGIT antibodies are under development as a novel immunotherapy approach. A promising research area includes the combination with anti-PD-1 therapies in advanced NSCLCs.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody 22C3 is the approved companion diagnostic immunohistochemistry test for treatment with pembrolizumab and cemiplimab in multiple cancer types. The 22C3 and 28-8 antibodies target the extracellular domain (ECD) of PD-L1, which is known to contain N-glycosylation sites. We hypothesize that antigenicity could be affected by the degradation of the glycan part of the epitope and thus change the scoring of the assay over time. Here, we test samples over time and assess the effects of time and deglycosylation on PD-L1 signal by comparing an antibody with an ECD antigen to an antibody with an intracellular domain (ICD) antigen. Ten whole-tissue sections of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 2018 were selected for testing. Fresh-cut serial sections for each case were stained on DAKO Link48 for 22C3 according to the label. In parallel, a previously described laboratory-developed test using E1L3N (an ICD antibody) was performed on the Leica BondRX. Tumor proportion scores for 22C3 and E1L3N were read by a pathologist and compared to the previous clinical diagnoses. To determine the effect using a quantitative approach, a tissue microarray (TMA) cohort with 90 NSCLC cases was similarly assessed. Finally, to determine whether the possible effect of epitope glycosylation, antibodies were tested before and after enzymatic deglycosylation of specimens. We found that 6 of 7 archival positive samples showed a significant reduction in positive staining with 22C3 compared to the original diagnostic sample assessed 3 years earlier. In an older archival TMA cohort, a quantitative significant difference in signal intensity was noted when staining with 22C3 was compared to E1L3N. This loss of signal was not noted in the fresh cell line TMA consistent with a time-dependent degradation of staining. Finally, quantitative assessment of the fresh TMA showed a significant loss of signal after a deglycosylation procedure when stained with 22C3, which was not seen when stained with E1L3N. We believe that these data show that the glycan part of the 22C3 epitope is not stable over time, and that this issue should be considered when assessing archival tissue for diagnostic or research purposes.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the impact of age on the effectiveness and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of programmed death-(ligand)1 [PD-(L)1] inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a novel text-mining technique. This retrospective study included patients with stage III/IV NSCLC treated with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab) at Leiden University Medical Centre and Haga Teaching hospital, (both in The Netherlands) from September 2016 to May 2021. All the relevant data was extracted from the structured and unstructured fields of the Electronic Health Records using a novel text-mining tool. Effectiveness [progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)] and safety (the incidence of nine potentially fatal irAEs and systemic corticosteroid requirement) outcomes were compared across age subgroups (young:\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years, Middle-aged: 65-74\u00a0years, and old:\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years) after adjustment for confounding. Of 689 patients, 310 patients (45.0%) were\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years, 275 patients (39.9%) were aged between 65 and 74\u00a0years, and 104 patients (15.1%) were\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0years. There was no significant difference between younger and older patients regarding PFS (median PFS 12, 8, 13\u00a0months respectively; Hazard ratio (HR) The use of PD-(L)1 inhibitors is not associated with age related decrease of PFS and OS, nor with increased incidence of serious irAEs compared to younger patients receiving these treatments. Chronological age must therefore not be used as a predictor for the effectiveness or safety of ICIs.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is now first-line standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This real-life study aimed to assess efficacy and safety of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. CAP29 is a retrospective, observational, multicenter real-life study conducted in 6 French centers. We evaluated efficacy of first-line setting chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab (November 2019 to September 2020) in advanced (stage III-IV) non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients without targetable alterations. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, objective response rate and safety. With a median follow-up of 4.5 months (0 to 22 months), a total of 121 patients were included. Baseline characteristics were: median age of 59.8 years with 7.4% \u226575 years, 58.7% of males, 91.8% PS 0-1, 87.6% of stage IV with \u22653 metastatic sites in 62% of cases. Patients had brain and liver metastases in 24% and 15.7% of cases, respectively. PD-L1 was <1% (44.6%), 1-49% (28.1%) and \u226550% (21.5%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival achieved 9 and 20.6 months, respectively. Objective response rate was 63.7% with 7 prolonged complete responses. Survival benefit seemed to be correlated with PD-L1 expression. Brain and liver metastases were not statistically associated with decreased overall survival. Most common adverse events were asthenia (76%), anemia (61.2%), nausea (53.7%), decreased appetite (37.2%) and liver cytolysis (34.7%). Renal and hepatic disorders were the main causes of pemetrexed discontinuation. Grade 3-4 adverse events concerned 17.5% of patients. Two treatment-related deaths were reported. First-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy confirmed real-life efficacy for patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. With median progression-free survival and overall survival of 9.0 and 20.6 months, respectively and no new safety signal, our real-life data are very close to results provided by clinical trials, confirming the benefit and the manageable toxicity profile of this combination.",

Furthermore, the combination of necitumumab with immune checkpoint inhibitors has the potential to enhance tumor immunity and improve the therapeutic effect. Thus, we planned and initiated this phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of necitumumab plus pembrolizumab, nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel), and carboplatin therapy for patients with previously untreated SqCLC. In phase I, the primary endpoint is the tolerability and recommended dose of necitumumab combined with pembrolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin. In phase II, the primary endpoint is the overall response rate. Secondary endpoints are disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Forty-two patients will be enrolled in phase II.

To date, it remains unclear how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the treatment outcome. A quasi-experimental study was conducted based on a real-world database, comparing pandemic with pre-pandemic patient cohorts. The pandemic cohort consisted of patients who initiated treatment from March to July 2020, with follow-up through March 2021. The pre-pandemic cohort consisted of those initiating treatment between March and July 2019.The outcome was overall real-world survival. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models were constructed. Analyses included data from 2090 patients: 998 in the pandemic cohort and 1092 in the pre-pandemic cohort. Baseline characteristics were comparable, with 33% of patients having PD-L1 expression level \u226550% and 29% of patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. Among those treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy (N = 613), there was a differential impact of the pandemic on survival by PD-L1 expression levels ( The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in survival among patients with lower PD-L1 expression who were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy.

We now present 5-year clinical outcomes from this trial, representing to our knowledge, the longest follow-up data for neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 in any cancer type. Two doses of nivolumab (3 mg/kg) were administered for 4 weeks before surgery to 21 patients with Stage I-IIIA NSCLC. 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and associations with MPR and PD-L1, were evaluated. With a median follow-up of 63 months, 5-year RFS and OS rates were 60% and 80%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are representative malignancies that respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Research has been conducted to identify biomarkers, such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), that would allow the response to ICI therapy to be predicted; however, the complex tumor immune system consisting of both host and tumor factors may also exert an influence. Computed tomographic imaging (CT) incidentally revealed a left renal mass, and a left pulmonary nodule with multiple lymph node metastases (LNMs). Firstly, video-assisted thoracic surgery revealed a lung tumor invading the chest wall. Histologically, the findings of the tumor were consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed positive PD-L1 expression. The renal tumor was excised by robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Histologically, the renal tumor showed the features of clear cell carcinoma (CCC). Four months after the RAPN, CT revealed left hydronephrosis caused by an enhancing ureteral tumor. Then, multiple right lung metastases appeared, and the left lung tumor increased. Following treatment including atezolizumab, the primary lung SCC and the multiple LNMs almost disappeared completely, while the ureteral and right lung metastases showed progression. The ureteral metastasis was resected by left open nephroureterectomy. Histology of the ureteral tumor revealed features consistent with CCC. Histological examination of the multiple right lung metastases that were resected by partial lobectomy via a small thoracic incision also revealed features consistent with CCC. Two months after nephroureterectomy, a solitary left lung metastasis was treated by nivolumab and ipilimumab. Six months after nephroureterectomy, the patient died of RCC. Further studies of specimens revealed that the tumor cells in the primary RCC and the ureteral and lung metastases showed negative results of IHC for PD-L1. The responses to ICI therapy of concomitant RCC and NSCLC were quite different. The PD-L1 expression status in individual tumors in cases of multiple primary malignancies (MPMs) may directly predict the response of each malignancy to ICI therapy, because the host immune system, which may affect the response to ICI therapy, could be the same in MPMs.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatment regimens have become the standard of care for first-line treatment of metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, most patients inevitably develop disease progression, and the mechanisms of resistance to first-line immunotherapy are not clear. ICIs in combination with agents targeting other pathways may serve as second-line therapy options. Plinabulin is a selective immunomodulating microtubule-binding agent which inhibits the polymerization of tubulin monomers, with multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth. Clinical studies have demonstrated preliminary the antitumor efficacy of this agent. Therefore, we hypothesize that a combination of plinabulin with programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor and docetaxel may result in higher efficacy and fewer side effects leading to better tolerance.

    "abstract": "Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present promising application prospects in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate optimal treatment strategy by comparing the first-line treatment strategies with ICIs in NSCLC. We retrieved relevant studies on first-line therapy of NSCLC with ICIs. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were treatment-related serious adverse events (tr-SAEs) with grade 3 or higher and objective response rate (ORR). We also conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis. We included 14 studies involving 7,823 patients and compared seven different interventions. In PD-L1 nonselective NSCLC, nivolumab+ipilimumab had good PFS and ORR, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged OS, and nivolumab had the fewest adverse events (AEs). For PD-L1-positive patients, nivolumab remarkably prolonged OS. For those with negative PD-L1, nivolumab+ipilimumab also showed an advantage. In addition, nivolumab+ipilimumab significantly prolonged the PFS in both PD-L1-negative and -positive patients. For patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) within 1-49%, atezolizumab+chemotherapy remarkably prolonged PFS and OS. For those with PD-L1 TPS \u226550%, pembrolizumab prolonged OS and atezolizumab+chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS. Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab showed advantages in OS, PFS and ORR in most patients. Nivolumab+ipilimumab may be the optimal first-line therapy for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated whether tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB) and STK11, KEAP1, and KRAS mutations have clinical utility as biomarkers for pembrolizumab monotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (tumor proportion score \u22651%) advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR/ALK alterations in the phase III KEYNOTE-042 trial. This retrospective exploratory analysis assessed prevalence of tTMB and STK11, KEAP1, and KRAS mutations determined by whole-exome sequencing of tumor tissue and matched normal DNA and their associations with outcomes in KEYNOTE-042. Clinical utility of tTMB was assessed using a prespecified cut point of 175 mutations/exome. Of 793 patients, 345 (43.5%) had tTMB \u2265175 mutations/exome and 448 (56.5%) had tTMB <175 mutations/exome. No association was observed between PD-L1 expression and tTMB. Continuous tTMB score was associated with improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival among patients receiving pembrolizumab (Wald test, one-sided P < 0.001) but not those receiving chemotherapy (Wald test, two-sided P > 0.05). tTMB \u2265175 mutations/exome was associated with improved outcomes for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy, whereas tTMB <175 mutations/exome was not {OS: hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.80] and 1.09 (95% CI 0.88-1.36); progression-free survival: 0.75 (0.59-0.95) and 1.27 (1.04-1.55), respectively}. Improved OS [hazard ratio (95% CI)] for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was observed regardless of STK11 [STK11 mutant (n\u00a0= 33): 0.37 (0.16-0.86), STK11 wild-type (n\u00a0= 396): 0.83 (0.65-1.05)]; KEAP1 [KEAP1 mutant (n\u00a0=\u00a064): 0.75 (0.42-1.35), KEAP1 wild-type (n\u00a0= 365): 0.78 (0.61-0.99)], or KRAS [KRAS mutant (n\u00a0= 69): 0.42 (0.22-0.81); KRAS wild-type (n\u00a0= 232): 0.86 (0.63-1.18)] mutation status. tTMB with a cut point of \u2265175 mutations/exome is a potential predictive biomarker for pembrolizumab monotherapy for advanced/metastatic PD-L1 tumor proportion score \u22651% NSCLC. Pembrolizumab is a standard first-line treatment in this setting regardless of STK11, KEAP1, or KRAS mutation status.",

    "abstract": "Membranous nephropathy (MN) is an autoimmune disease, which is classified into primary and secondary MN. Malignancy-associated MN (M-MN) accounts for about 10% of secondary MN cases. Lung cancer is the most common type of malignancy among M-MN patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have showed promising efficacy and good safety in many types of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer. To date, whether ICIs could be a treatment option for M-MN patients with PD-L1 expression and or high tumor mutation burden (TMB) level has not been documented. A 68-year-old male patient presented with edema of the lower limbs with increased urine foam in August 2018. Biopsy on the right kidney showed MN at stage I with subepithelially localized immune deposits. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC)-associated MN with PD-L1 expression (20%) and high TMB level (26.2 mutations/Mb). The patient received immunosuppressive therapy targeting the initially diagnosed primary MN as first-line treatment plus surgery and radiochemotherapy following pembrolizumab targeting the definitively diagnosed lung cancer as second-line treatment. The patient benefited from radiochemotherapy following pembrolizumab (lasting more than 38 months) rather than immunosuppressive therapy. Our work suggests that combined ICIs might be an effective treatment option for M-MN patients who harbor PD-L1 expression. Our work highlights that the presence of malignancy should not be neglected at the initial diagnosis of MN.",

This retrospective multicentre study assessed real-world use and efficacy of both strategies. Patients with advanced NSCLC PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% from eight hospitals who had received at least one cycle of IO-mono or CT-IO were included. Overall survival (OS) and real-word progression-free-survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs, and a Cox model with inverse propensity treatment weighting was carried out. Among the 243 patients included, 141 (58%) received IO-mono and 102 (42%) CT-IO. Younger patients, those with symptomatic disease and brain metastases were more likely to be proposed CT-IO. With a median follow-up of 11.5\u00a0months (95% CI 10.4-13.3), median OS was not reached, but no difference was observed between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.51). Early deaths at 12\u00a0weeks were 11% (95% CI 4.6-16.9) and 15.2% (95% CI 9.0-20.9) in CT-IO and IO groups (p\u2009=\u20090.32). After adjustment for age, gender, performance status, histology, brain metastases, liver metastases and tobacco status, no statistically significant difference was found for OS between groups, neither in the multivariate adjusted model [HR 1.07 (95% CI 0.61-1.86), p\u2009=\u20090.8] nor in propensity adjusted analysis [HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.60-1.65), p\u2009=\u20090.99].

    "abstract": "To quantify the long-term comparative efficacy and safety of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI) relative to other immunotherapy (IO)-based regimens and chemotherapy in patients with first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Phase 3 randomized controlled-trials (RCTs) with minimum 3-year follow-up evaluating IO-based regimens approved for first-line aNSCLC were identified via systematic literature review. Analytic populations were defined by levels of PD-L1 expression and histology. Due to presence of proportional hazards violations, time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated via Bayesian fractional polynomial network meta-analysis. For safety endpoints, odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs). CheckMate 227, KEYNOTE-189, KEYNOTE-407, KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-042, and IMpower150 were included in the base case analysis. For OS and PFS, HRs of NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI relative to other IO-based regimens trended downward over time across analytic populations. The 36-month OS HRs of NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI versus comparators were: 0.69 (95\u00a0% credible interval: 0.47, 1.00) versus pembrolizumab\u00a0+\u00a0chemotherapy and 0.65 (0.45, 0.93) versus atezolizumab\u00a0+\u00a0bevacizumab\u00a0+\u00a0chemotherapy in the non-squamous and PD-L1 all-comers population; 0.73 (0.53, 1.02) versus pembrolizumab\u00a0+\u00a0chemotherapy in the squamous and PD-L1 all-comers population; and 1.05 (0.83, 1.32) versus pembrolizumab in the mixed histology and PD-L1\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0% population. For PFS, 36-month HR point estimates ranged from 0.46 to 0.85 (only statistically significant versus pembrolizumab\u00a0+\u00a0chemotherapy in the squamous population; 0.46 [0.31, 0.69]). Adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation were not statistically significantly different between NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI and pembrolizumab\u00a0+\u00a0chemotherapy, nor between NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI and pembrolizumab monotherapy, although treatment-related grade\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 AEs were higher with NIVO\u00a0+\u00a0IPI than pembrolizumab monotherapy (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.21 [1.30, 3.75]).

    "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stroma are expected to accurately predict the efficacy of programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade therapy. However, little is known about the prognostic significance of TILs in first-line PD-1 therapy. We assessed TILs in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab in the palliative setting. Multiplex immunohistochemistry staining of TILs (CD4, CD8, Foxp3, and PD-1) and immunohistochemical staining of CK and PD-L1 in the tumor and stroma was performed in tumor specimens of 107 NSCLC patients and correlated with clinical outcomes, as a single-center retrospective study. TILs and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) were assessed on biopsies (N\u2009=\u200993) or surgical resections (N\u2009=\u200914) before first-line pembrolizumab. A low number of stromal CD4 TILs were significantly associated with bone metastasis and poor performance status (PS). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in patients with a high number of stromal CD4 TILs (336\u00a0days and 731\u00a0days, respectively) than in those with low infiltration (204\u00a0days and 333\u00a0days, respectively). Patients with a high number of intratumoral CD8 TILs (731\u00a0days) yielded significantly better OS than those with low infiltration (333\u00a0days), but not for PFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that stromal CD4 TILs were independent predictors of PFS, but not OS. Furthermore, intratumoral CD8 TILs were independent predictors of better OS. In the survival analysis of key subgroups, stromal CD4 TILs were identified as significant predictors of survival in patients with non-adenocarcinomatous histology and PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%. Stromal CD4 TILs were identified as a significant marker for predicting the PFS after pembrolizumab therapy, especially in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and high PD-L1 expression. In addition, intratumoral CD8 TILs were identified as significant predictors of OS.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have not simultaneously compared the cost-effectiveness of six immunotherapies with chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness across different programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels. A Markov model with lifetime horizon was created for seven regimens: pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembro-chemo), nivolumab plus ipilimumab (nivo-ipi), nivolumab, ipilimumab plus chemotherapy (nivo-ipi-chemo), atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (atezo-chemo), atezolizumab, bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (atezo-beva-chemo), single-agent pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy alone. Input parameters were derived from trial data, a network meta-analysis, and other literature. We conducted the analysis from the perspective of US health care sector. For all patients without considering PD-L1 expression, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pembro-chemo versus chemotherapy was $183,299 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The preferred regimens based on ICERs differed by PD-L1 levels. For patients with PD-L1 \u226550%, pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy and pembro-chemo versus pembrolizumab resulted in ICERs of $96,189 and $198,913 per QALY, respectively. The other strategies were dominated. For patients with PD-L1 of 1%-49%, the ICER of pembro-chemo comparing to chemotherapy was $218,159 per QALY. The other regimens were dominated by pembro-chemo. For patients with PD-L1 <1%, nivo-ipi versus chemotherapy and nivo-ipi-chemo versus nivo-ipi resulted in ICERs of $161,277 and $881,975 per QALY, and the other regimens were dominated strategies. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY, pembrolizumab had 87% and pembro-chemo had 1% probabilities being cost-effective in patients with PD-L1 \u226550% and 1%-49%, respectively. Nivo-ipi had a 34% probability being cost-effective in patients with PD-L1 <1%. The PD-L1 level should be incorporated into treatment decision-making. Our findings suggest that first-line pembrolizumab, pembro-chemo, and nivo-ipi are the preferred strategies for patients with PD-L1 \u226550%, 1%-49%, and <1%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Atezolizumab has recently been approved for first-line treatment of high PD-L1 expression metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with no EGFR or ALK mutations, on the basis of the IMpower110 trial. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab compared with pembrolizumab among these patients in Spanish settings, based on the results of the two cut-offs of the IMpower110 study. A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to Spanish settings to calculate health outcomes and costs over a lifetime horizon. Clinical data for atezolizumab were collected from the interim and the exploratory results (data cut-off: Sept'18 and Feb'20, respectively) of the IMpower110 trial while a network meta-analysis was used to model pembrolizumab treatment. Utility data were collected from the trial. Direct medical costs were considered based on resources identified by experts. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Health outcomes were expressed as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. Over a lifetime horizon, the incremental results showed that atezolizumab generated similar health outcomes (LYs and QALYs) to pembrolizumab, with minimal differences depending on the cut-off used (+\u20090.70 and\u2009+\u20090.42 LYs and QALYs with Sept'18 cut-off and -\u00a00.80 and -\u00a00.72 LYs and QALYs with Feb'20 cut-off). However, for both cut-offs, atezolizumab produced meaningfully less costs than pembrolizumab (\u20ac -\u00a054,261 with Sept'18 cut-off and \u20ac -\u00a081,907 with Feb'20 cut-off). The sensitivity analyses carried out confirmed the robustness of the base-case results. The cost-effectiveness analysis, comparing the two cut-off of IMpower110, shows that atezolizumab provides similar health gains to pembrolizumab but at a lower cost for the first-line treatment of metastasic NSCLC patients in Spain.",

Biomarkers, such as programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutational burden (TMB), seemed to be helpful in selecting patients who are more likely to benefit from ICI treatment: however, their role has not yet been fully clarified. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the relationship between pre-treatment peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and survival in 252 patients suffering from advanced NSCLC who had received pembrolizumab as their first-line immunotherapy. Compared to their NLR low counterparts who had a median overall survival (OS) of 34.8 months, patients with NLRs above 4.8 had a median OS of 7.6 months (HR=3.26, 95%Cl=2.3-4.6, p-value<0.0000001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, alongside other variables, such as metastatic sites, age, and sex, NLR and PD-L1 predicted progression-free survival and OS; furthermore, a very high NLR - over 10 - seemed to forecast a very dismal prognosis in patients undergoing immunotherapy, with sudden deaths in the days immediately following therapy (median OS=3.8 months). NLR acts as a valuable and reliable prognostic factor in non-small cell lung carcinoma patients undergoing first line immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Additional investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the underlying biological rationale, which can be found in myeloid derived suppressor cells, a heterogeneous population of cells with neutrophil-like immunophenotypic features.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), its ligand (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have shown promising results against multiple cancers, where they reactivate exhausted T cells primed to eliminate tumor cells. ICI therapies have been particularly successful in hypermutated cancers infiltrated with lymphocytes. However, resistance may appear in tumors evading the immune system through alternative mechanisms than the PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 pathways. A systematic pan-cancer literature search was conducted to examine the association between alternative immune evasion mechanisms via the antigen presentation machinery (APM) and resistance towards ICI treatments targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab), PD-L1 (durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab), and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab). The APM proteins included the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I, its subunit beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1, TAP2, and the NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5). In total, 18 cohort studies (including 21 original study cohorts) containing 966 eligible patients and 9 case studies including 12 patients were reviewed. Defects in the APM significantly predicted poor clinical benefit with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.39 (95% CI 0.24\u22120.63, p < 0.001). The effect was non-significant, when considering complete and partial responses only (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.18\u22121.47, p = 0.216). In summary, the APM contains important targets for tumorigenic alterations which may explain insensitivity towards ICI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Biological response modifiers (immunotherapy) in combination to chemotherapy are superior to that of chemotherapy in treatment of breast cancer (triple-negative/HER-2 (\u2009+)), multiple myeloma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. This review article consists of a total of eighteen independent randomized controlled clinical trials ranging from phases one to three. Patients were randomly selected for immunomodulatory treatment or chemotherapy and assessed for a specific mutation expression that the immunomodulatory agent targets. Kaplan-Meier plots, swimmer plots, and bar graphs depict overall/progression-free survival, objective response, and clinical response rates. The data collected was assessed by using 95% confidence interval and a p value of 0.05. Patients were treated until disease progression. Biological response modifiers (immunotherapy) resulted in significantly longer median progression-free survival in PD-L1-positive breast cancer (7.5\u00a0months compared to 5.0\u00a0months in control group), multiple myeloma (60.7% compared to 26.9% in the daratumumab and placebo groups, respectively), and in non-small-cell lung cancer (median progression-free survival was 10.3\u00a0months in the pembrolizumab group compared to 6.0\u00a0months in the chemotherapy group): higher complete responses in multiple myeloma (79% and 66% in the elotuzumab and control groups, respectively) and lower disease progression in PD-L1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (62.1% of pembrolizumab versus 50.3% of chemotherapy patients had no disease progression at 6\u00a0months). Combination biological response modifiers (immunotherapy) and chemotherapy displayed benefit in overall/progression-free survival, response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit, and invasive disease-free survival in triple-negative/HER2-2(\u2009+) breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-small-cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The use of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other anti-cancer agents was a priority for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with considerable PD-L1 expression. However, studies seldom show the progression of liver metastases after using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Data were obtained from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical University. In the present study, we analyzed five non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had liver metastases after they were treated with pembrolizumab between 2019 and 2021. All of them had both stable primary lesions and liver progression with pembrolizumab intervention. Blood laboratory tests and imaging examinations were performed regularly during the treatment to assess the tumor responses of patients. All patients displayed reduction or stability in the initial lesions as a result, but they also experienced the emergence of metastatic liver locations, which were regularly detected throughout immunotherapy. Additionally, the appearance of liver metastasis weakened their liver function gradually with the escalation of carcinoembryonic antigen, regarded as a predictor for evaluating the progression of tumors. These individuals were highly distinctive with hyper-progressive diseases associated with immunotherapy. We drew individualized intervention schemes for metastatic lesions in each patient and found that their life expectancy shared no significance given the restricting subjected population. Our study indicated a clinical phenomenon after using immune checkpoint inhibitors and presented a necessity for implementing large scales clinical studies to manage NSCLC-oriented liver metastasis.",

We report four cases of synchronous primary cancers, including advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCs) highly positive for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and initially treated with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab was efficacious in 2 patients with NSCLC lesions, followed by chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer (case 1) and chemotherapy for gastric cancer (case 2). Both cancers in case 1 showed a complete response for 3 years, while progression of the accompanying gastric cancer resulted in mortality at 20 months in case 2. Both NSCLC and gastric cancer in case 3 failed to respond to pembrolizumab, but the accompanying laryngeal cancer in case 4 showed a complete response, and cytotoxic chemotherapy for NSCLC was continued for 18.0 months. Our clinical experience suggests that pembrolizumab is a useful therapeutic approach for patients with synchronous cancers, including NSCLC that highly expresses PD-L1.",

    "abstract": "Enrolling patients in immunotherapy clinical trials is becoming increasingly competitive. Virtual clinical trials can help investigators answer key questions despite this. For example, pembrolizumab is the recommended first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no driver alterations and a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score \u226550%. Salvage therapies for relapsed/refractory patients are limited. Retrospective studies suggest that a subset of patients may benefit from pembrolizumab beyond progression; these results have not been validated in a prospective study. We constructed digital twins of patients and simulated clinical trials to predict the best salvage therapy after progressive disease (PD) on pembrolizumab. Response dynamics were evaluated at the lesion level to represent patients who experience systemic PD while individual lesions continue shrinking. With >25,000 radiographic lesion measurements from >500 patients, we simulated responses to pembrolizumab, chemotherapy, and PD on pembrolizumab followed by either pembrolizumab beyond progression or salvage chemotherapy. Switching all progressors to salvage chemotherapy was suboptimal. Virtual trials predicted progression-free survival (PFS) from pembrolizumab beyond progression to be comparable with salvage chemotherapy in patients whose PD was due to nontarget progression. A PFS-optimized regimen may improve disease control rates \u226515%. Pembrolizumab beyond progression may benefit a subset of patients with PD-L1-high, driver alteration-free NSCLC, but prospective studies are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the highly lethal forms of cancer whose incidence has worldwide rapidly increased over the past few decades. About 80-85% of all lung cancer cases constitute non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma as the main subtypes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have led to significant advances in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, significantly improving cancer patient survival rates. The cytotoxic drugs in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies is a new method that aims to reduce the activation of immunosuppressive and cancer cell prosurvival responses while also improving direct cancer cell death. The most commonly utilized immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with non-small cell lung cancer are monoclonal antibodies (Atezolizumab, Cemiplimab, Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab etc.) against PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Among them, Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ) and Cemiplimab (Libtayo) are engineered monoclonal anti programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies that inhibit binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1. As a result, T-cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis are inhibited leading to restoring the immune homeostasis to fight cancer cells. In this review article, the path leading to the introduction of immunotherapeutic options in lung cancer treatment is described, with analyzing the benefits and shortages of the current immunotherapeutic drugs. In addition, possibilities to co-administer immunotherapeutic agents with standard cancer treatment modalities are also considered.",

    "abstract": "In the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for those patients with negative PD-L1 expression, which treatment strategy has the better efficacy and safety between chemotherapy combined with antiangiogenic and with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is still unclear due to the absence of head-to-head clinical trials. This study aims to answer the question by performing a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were systematically searched accordingly to extract eligible studies from inception to October 2022, as well as the abstracts from the most recent main oncology congresses (American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs) of grades 3 to 5 were independently extracted and collected by two reviewers based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We used Cochrane's risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials through RevMan 5.3 to ascertain the quality of the included studies. NMA with a Bayesian random-effects model was performed by R (version 4.0.4). According to the ranking list from OS-NMA, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy has the most effective ranking first (surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) = 0.809844) (pooled HR = 0.65 [0.51-0.83]). On PFS, the triple combination of nivolumab/bevacizumab/chemotherapy ranks first (NMA estimate: HR = 0.35 [0.28-0.43]). On safety, in combination with chemotherapy, sintilimab has minimal toxicity, followed by pembrolizumab+chemo. In advanced NSCLC patients with negative PD-L1 expression, pembrolizumab+chemo ranks first in the efficacy of OS and does not apparently increase the incidence of any grade \u2265 3\u00a0AE as compared with chemo alone. On PFS, pembrolizumab also has advantages, but for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, camrelizumab+chemo seems to be a better choice. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42021231441.",

Dermatologic toxicities associated with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy have been widely reported in the literature.\u00a0Lichen planus is an inflammatory disease frequently seen in areas of the skin and oral mucous membrane lining. This autoimmune disorder is T-cell mediated with multiple contributing factors like emotional stress, genetic predisposition, isotopic response, or drugs. With increasing use of immunotherapy, early recognition and prompt treatment of associated adverse events are critical to ensure patient safety. Cutaneous toxicities are among the most commonly observed adverse events with this class of drugs.\u00a0Here, we report a case of lichen planus in a 66-year-old male patient receiving pembrolizumab for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was diagnosed 56 months ago\u00a0with advanced lung cancer with brain metastasis. He has received 62 cycles of pembrolizumab and continues to be in complete clinical and radiographic remission. Pembrolizumab is a drug that helps immune cells in killing cancer cells by binding to the PD-1 protein.

Bezafibrate, a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor complexes, has shown a synergistic antitumor effect with PD-1 blockade in mice that is mediated by activation of mitochondria in T cells. We have therefore now performed a phase 1 trial (UMIN000017854) of bezafibrate with nivolumab in previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who experience dose-limiting toxicity, and this combination regimen was found to be well tolerated. Preplanned comprehensive analysis of plasma metabolites and gene expression in peripheral cytotoxic T cells indicated that bezafibrate promoted T cell function through up-regulation of mitochondrial metabolism including fatty acid oxidation and may thereby have prolonged the duration of response. This combination strategy targeting T cell metabolism thus has the potential to maintain antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors and warrants further validation.",

    "abstract": "The PEOPLE trial aimed to identify new immune biomarkers in negative and low programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (0%-49%) advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab. Here we report the main outcomes and the circulating immune biomarkers analysis. The primary endpoint of this phase II trial was the identification of immune biomarkers associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR) and safety were secondary endpoints. Absolute cell counts for 36 subsets belonging to innate and adaptive immunity were determined by multiparametric flow cytometry in peripheral blood at baseline and at first radiologic evaluation. An orthoblique principal components-based clustering approach and multivariable Cox regression model adjusted for clinical variables were used to analyze immune variables and their correlation with clinical endpoints. From May 2018 to October 2020, 65 patients were enrolled. After a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the median PFS was 2.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-5.6 months] and median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI 8.7-17.1 months). The ORR was 21.5%, DCR was 47.7% and median DoR was 14.5 months (95% CI 6.4-24.9 months). Drug-related grade 3-4 adverse events were 9.2%. Higher T cell and natural killer (NK) cell count at baseline and at the first radiologic evaluation were associated with improved PFS, DCR and OS. On the contrary, higher myeloid cell count at baseline or at the first radiologic evaluation was significantly associated with worse OS and DCR. Circulating immune biomarkers can contribute to predict outcomes in negative and low PD-L1 aNSCLC patients treated with first-line single-agent pembrolizumab.",

    "abstract": "While cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy has been the standard of care for the past two decades, the recent introduction of immunotherapy has heralded an important milestone in the adjuvant landscape of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The landmark approval of adjuvant atezolizumab based on disease-free survival (DFS) benefit in IMpower010 was swiftly followed by the recent data for use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091, and similar trials involving other immune checkpoint inhibitors are eagerly anticipated. Although both atezolizumab and pembrolizumab demonstrated a significant DFS benefit in the intention-to-treat population, key subgroup analyses have raised questions about the role of predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and EGFR-mutation status. In this review, we examine the data from the two important trials (IMpower010 and PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091), discuss the controversies surrounding adjuvant immunotherapy including appropriate endpoints, biomarker selection and highlight key considerations in oncogene-driven NSCLC. Finally, we propose future directions including the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on developments in the adjuvant immunotherapy paradigm and role of minimal residual disease (MRD).",

    "title": "Gastrointestinal toxicity of systemic oncology immunotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Systemic anti-cancer immunotherapy provides a substantial progress in options of current oncology treatment. Yet, this therapeutic approach is potentially associated with a significant gastrointestinal toxicity. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review on pathogenesis, clinical features, dia gnostics and therapy of these toxicities. Review of current knowledge: Check-point inhibitors brought a major progress in anti-cancer immunotherapy and improved significantly prognosis of several malignancies (e. g. metastatic malignant melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, gastric and colorectal cancers in high-risk population associated with presence of pathogenic mutations, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and urothelial carcinoma). They include monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; e. g. ipilimumab, tremelimumab), programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1; e. g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and its ligand PD-L1 (e. gatezolizumab, avelumab). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is another new option for haematological malignancies and metastatic colorectal cancer. Major symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity caused by systemic immunotherapy include diarrhoea (20-50%), entero-colitis (1-10%) and laboratory or clinical signs of hepatopathy (~10%). Anti-cancer immunotherapy can be also complicated by infections (Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma and/ or cytomegalovirus). There is no data on other possible complications so far. However, it can be assumed that these will also include bile acid malabsorption as well as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome. Treatment of gastrointestinal complications of immunotherapy should be graded according to their severity. It includes symptomatic medications (e. g. loperamide), systemic glucocorticoids and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (alone or together with mycofenolate mofetil or tacrolimus in the most severe cases). Awareness of possible complications of systemic anti-cancer immunotherapy is crucial for patients safety. It is mandatory to consider immune-related adverse events, complicating infections, bile acids malabsorption and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome. Prompt proper dia gnostics and immediate vigorous therapy infl uence the outcome of patients signifi cantly. A strictly individualized approach is indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 75-80% of all lung cancer cases. Stage III NSCLC represents a highly heterogenous stage characterized by different disease presentations and a wide range of treatment options. For patients with good performance status and unresectable-stage III NSCLC with programmed death-ligands 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651%, durvalumab consolidation immunotherapy after a platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy is strongly recommended. However, age, poor performance status, underlying comorbidities may represent contraindications for chemotherapy to be used in a subgroup of patients. Herein, we report a case of an 80-year-old male affected by a stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma with overexpression of PD-L1 (TPS 90%) treated with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, which shows a complete resolution of lung lesion after four cycles of treatment. Although randomized controlled trials are required, this case report may suggest the potential role of pembrolizumab for chemotherapy unsuitable patients with overexpressing PD-L1 unresectable-stage III NSCLC.",

In April 2020, based on pharmacokinetic modeling without formal comparative studies, the FDA approved 400 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W). Pharmacokinetic studies also suggested comparable target engagement with weight-based and flat dosing for the respective schedules. The objective of this study was to determine if overall survival (OS) differs based on the Q3W vs. Q6W dosing schedule of pembrolizumab. BC Cancer patients with stage IV NSCLC and PDL1 \u226550% treated with pembrolizumab were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated with weight-based dosing, per institution standard, of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W or 4 mg/kg Q6W. Patient demographics, treatment and outcome were recorded. Patients were assigned to Q3W or Q6W according to the schedule that was used for the majority of treatment (greater than 50%). 718 patients with NSCLC and PDL1 \u226550% received first-line pembrolizumab between 2017 and2021, Q3W/Q6W dosing 677/41 patients. Baseline characteristics with respect to age, sex, smoking status, histology and performance status (PS) were similar between groups. In the multivariate model, including age, sex, PS and dosing schedule, the hazard ratio for death (HR) for OS Q3W vs. Q6W was 0.759 ( There was no OS difference demonstrated with pembrolizumab dosing Q3W compared to Q6W in a multivariate analysis that included age, sex and PS. A case-matched analysis that controlled for these variables and for duration of treatment confirmed these findings. This study supports the use of Q6W pembrolizumab dosing, allowing for less frequent interactions with the medical system.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy using a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) alone or in combination with chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without driver mutations for which targeted therapies have been approved. It is unknown whether continuing CPI treatment beyond disease progression results in improved outcomes. Patients who experienced progressive disease (PD) after a clinical benefit from chemotherapy plus a CPI were enrolled. Patients received pembrolizumab (200\u00a0mg every 3 weeks) plus next-line chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Key secondary end points included the overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate, and toxicity. The authors' hypothesis was that continuing pembrolizumab beyond progression would improve the median PFS to 6\u00a0months in comparison with a historical control of 3\u00a0months with single-agent chemotherapy alone. Between May 2017 and February 2020, 35 patients were enrolled. The patient and disease characteristics were as follows: 51.4% were male; 82.9% were current or former smokers; and 74.3%, 20%, and 5.7% had adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and NSCLC not otherwise specified, respectively. The null hypothesis that the median PFS would be 3\u00a0months was rejected (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The median PFS was 5.1\u00a0months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-8.0 months). The median OS was 24.5\u00a0months (95% CI, 15.6-30.9 months). The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (60%), anemia (54.3%), and nausea (42.9%). There were no treatment-related deaths. Pembrolizumab plus next-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC who experienced PD after a clinical benefit from a CPI was associated with statistically significant higher PFS in comparison with historical controls of single-agent chemotherapy alone.",

We further characterized clinical benefit with this regimen in a large pooled patient population and assessed the effect of response on survival. Data were pooled from four studies of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab in advanced NSCLC (CheckMate 227 Part 1, 817 cohort A, 568 Part 1, and 012). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, duration of response, and safety were assessed. Landmark analyses of OS by response status at 6 months and by tumor burden reduction in responders to nivolumab plus ipilimumab were also assessed. In the pooled population (N\u00a0= 1332) with a minimum follow-up of 29.1-58.9 months, median OS was 18.6\u00a0months, with a 3-year OS rate of 35%; median PFS was 5.4 months (3-year PFS rate, 17%). Objective response rate was 36%; median duration of response was 23.7 months, with 38% of responders having an ongoing response at 3 years. In patients with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1%, \u22651%, 1%-49%, or \u226550%, 3-year OS rates were 30%, 38%, 30%, and 48%.

    "abstract": "Taxane chemotherapy represents the standard of care in the second-line setting for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but immunotherapy agents pose great challenges. Whether immunotherapy/chemotherapy alone or combination therapy has more benefits remains controversial. In this study, we provided comparisons to integrate the efficacy of immunotherapy and taxane chemotherapy as second- or later-line treatments in advanced NSCLC. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched from inception to September 1, 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing immunotherapy and taxane chemotherapy were enrolled in the Bayesian network analysis. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with hazard ratios (HRs) were investigated. Eight trials in 13 studies with 4398 patients comparing seven treatments were identified. Pembrolizumab 10\u2009mg/kg was associated with the best improved OS, with significant differences versus docetaxel (HR 0.81, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.74-0.88), avelumab (HR 0.84, 95% CrI 0.75-0.95), and pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg plus docetaxel (HR 0.75, 95% CrI 0.56-1.00). Although pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg plus docetaxel ranked the last in terms of OS, the combination therapy showed the most favorable PFS. Additionally, the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) agent, avelumab, was associated with the least improvement in PFS. As second- or later-line therapeutic strategies, pembrolizumab 10\u2009mg/kg provided the largest OS benefits and pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg plus docetaxel improved PFS to the greatest extent. Considering that immunotherapy has been recommended to the first-line setting of NSCLC, advanced patients who have not received immunotherapy previously might be the suitable population for our findings.",

Subgroup analyses showed that among patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u2265 50%, atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and nivolumab plus ipilimumab resulted in superior OS benefits at 18 and 60 months, respectively.

Effectiveness inputs were derived from the 5-year analysis of KEYNOTE-024 phase III clinical trial. The intervention was pembrolizumab monotherapy; the comparator was a weighted average of the 5 chemotherapy regimens from the trial. The population included those with previously untreated advanced PD-L1 TPS \u2265 50% NSCLC. A de novo partitioned survival model was developed. Survival modeling was done using Bayesian model averaging on fitted parametric functions. Costs included drug acquisition, treatment initiation, administration and monitoring, adverse events, subsequent treatments, and terminal care. Costs and health state utilities were sourced from the literature and Irish sources. The model had a 20-year time horizon. The perspective taken was the Health Service Executive. A 4% discount rate was applied. Outcomes were expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured in terms of incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 1-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model estimated a base case ICER of \u20ac54 237 per QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated an average ICER of \u20ac54 568 per QALY and a 11% probability of cost-effectiveness at the Irish cost-effectiveness threshold of \u20ac45 000 per QALY. At the current list price, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy is not considered cost-effective for the treatment of advanced PD-L1 TPS \u2265 50% NSCLC in the Irish healthcare setting.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway have dramatically changed the treatment landscape of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, combination approaches are required to extend this benefit beyond a subset of patients. In addition, it is of equal interest whether these combination therapy can be applied to neoadjuvant therapy of early-stage NSCLC. In this study, we hypothesized that combining immunotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapy may have a synergistic effect in local tumor control and neoadjuvant therapy. To this end, the effect of combination of bevacizumab and pembrolizumab in humanized mouse models was evaluated. Furthermore, we innovatively constructed a neoadjuvant mouse model that can simulate postoperative recurrence and metastasis of NSCLC to perform neoadjuvant study. Tumor growth and changes in the tumor vasculature, along with the frequency and phenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, were examined. Additionally, in vivo imaging system (IVIS) was used to observe the effect of neoadjuvant therapy. Results showed that combination therapy could inhibited tumor growth by transforming tumor with low immunoreactivity into inflamed ('hot') tumor, as demonstrated by increased CD8",

    "abstract": "The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 22C3 assay is one of the approved companion diagnostic assays for receiving anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy. Our study evaluated the performance of E1L3N and 22C3 antibodies in estimating PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our retrospective study included 46 patients diagnosed with unresectable EGFR/ALK/ROS1-negative NSCLC who received first-line pembrolizumab therapy between 2018 and 2021. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry of baseline tissue biopsy samples was performed using PDL1-E1L3N and PDL1-22C3 antibodies. The concordance between the PD-L1 assays and the treatment outcomes was assessed. Using a tumor proportion score (TPS) cutoff of \u22651%, 67.4% of patients are evaluated to be positive using PDL1-E1L3N and 73.9% using PDL1-22C3. Using a TPS of \u226550% as the cutoff, 26.1% of patients are positive using PDL1-E1L3N and 30.4% using PDL1-22C3. The PDL1-22C3 and PDL1-E1L3N assays are highly concordant and reveal a correlation coefficient of 0.925 (p < 0.0001). Patients with PDL1-E1L3N TPS\u2009>\u200950% have a significantly higher objective response rate than patients with PDL1-E1L3N TPS\u2009<\u20091% (p\u2009=\u20090.047), with a similar trend observed for PDL1-22C3 (p\u2009=\u20090.051). Consistent with PDL1-22C3, patients with higher PDL1-E1L3N expression (\u226550%, 1-49%) have longer progression-free survival than those with PDL1-E1L3N TPS\u2009<\u20091%. Our study provides clinical evidence on the concordance of PD-L1 TPS scores between clones E1L3N and 22C3. Moreover, the treatment responses to pembrolizumab are also comparable between the PDL1-E1L3N and PDL1-22C3. These findings indicate that E1L3N is a reliable and cost-effective assay and may serve as an alternative to 22C3. To determine which patients might be suitable to receive immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that triggers the immune system to target the patient\u2019s tumor, a PD-L1 test is sometimes used. This test looks at the levels of PD-L1, which indicate whether immunotherapy might work in the patient. One of the tests commonly used can be expensive and a reliable and cost-effective alternative is needed. Here, we compare the results of PD-L1 testing with that test with an alternative that is more cost-effective. We show that the two tests are highly concordant, and also demonstrate that the results using the alternative test are able to predict response to immunotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Our findings provide evidence that the alternative, more cost-effective test might be useful and reliable in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative recurrence in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a major issue for life expectancy. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is important in the prognosis of NSCLC. However, the predictive ability of PD-L1 evaluated with archived surgical specimens for nivolumab treatment have remained unknown. This study was aimed to analyze the predictive ability of the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) for nivolumab response in patients with NSCLC experiencing a postoperative recurrence using archived surgical specimens. This retrospective cohort study involved patients with advanced NSCLC (N\u2009=\u200978) treated with nivolumab between April 2016 and September 2018. They were categorized into postoperative recurrence (N\u2009=\u200924) and non-postoperative recurrence (N\u2009=\u200954) groups. The predictive ability of PD-L1 TPS for response to nivolumab treatment in these two groups was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the predictive ability of PD-L1 TPS using rebiopsy specimens collected from the recurrent lesions in six patients of the postoperative recurrence group. PD-L1 TPS exhibited lower predictive performance in the postoperative recurrent group (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.58) compared with that in the non-post operative recurrent group (AUC\u2009=\u20090.81). Furthermore, PD-L1 TPS was significantly increased in rebiopsy specimens. The predictive performance of PD-L1 TPS in these specimens was higher (AUC\u2009=\u20090.90) than that in the archived surgical specimens. The study revealed that archived surgical specimens are inadequate for assessing the predictive ability of PD-L1 for nivolumab response, while rebiopsy specimens are adequate.",

We retrospectively collected data of patients aged 80 and older with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or melanoma treated with anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 regardless of the treatment line, in 14 institutions, between January 2014 and June 2017. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan Meier method. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE 5.0. Multivariate analyses were performed with the Cox model. Eighty-two patients were included (36 with NSCLC, 45 with melanoma). Their median age was 82\u2009years (range 80-93). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab were mainly used. In the NSCLC group, median PFS and OS were 2.3\u2009months (95%CI 1.8-6.1) and 8.8\u2009months (95%CI 5.5-18.1), respectively.

The albumin level was found to be independently associated with a better OS in both groups. Grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in 15 patients (18.5%). One patient died from ICI-induced pulmonary toxicity. Our study findings suggest that treatment with ICI in elderly patients with NSCLC and melanoma has a risk-benefit ratio that supports its use. However, we report in this cohort that one in five patients has a grade 3-4 IRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation.

Here, we investigated the associations among pre-treatment clinical factors, baseline overall tumor burden, and development of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs; grade\u2009\u2265\u20093) after pembrolizumab treatment with or without chemotherapy. We retrospectively examined consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy at Hakodate Goryoukaku Hospital from March 2017 to February 2021. The baseline overall tumor burden was measured as the sum of the unidimensional diameters of up to five target lesions. We defined irAEs as toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitors based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Tumor burden differed significantly between patients with and without severe irAEs (85 vs. 65\u00a0mm, p\u2009=\u20090.0367). The cutoff value for overall tumor burden was set to 80\u00a0mm.

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab and cemiplimab have been approved as treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with that of cemiplimab in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression from a societal perspective in the United States. Cost-effectiveness analysis integration of the network meta-analysis framework was performed using data from the EMPOWER-Lung 1, KEYNOTE 024, and KEYNOTE 042 phase 3 randomized clinical trials. A network meta-analysis including 2289 patients was constructed, and the Markov and partitioned survival (PS) models were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with that of cemiplimab for the treatment of high PD-L1 expression (\u226550% of tumor cells). The time horizon was 10 years. The main outcomes were overall costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, incremental net health benefits (INHB), and incremental net monetary benefits (INMB). The robustness of the model was verified using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Treatment of advanced NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression with pembrolizumab achieved 0.093 QALYs and was associated with an incremental cost of $10,657 compared with cemiplimab, yielding an ICER of $114,246/QALY. The ICER in the PS model was similar to that in the Markov model, with a difference of $3,093/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000/QALY, INHB, and INMB of pembrolizumab were -0.013 QALYs and -$1,329, respectively, and the probability of cemiplimab was 51% when compared with pembrolizumab. When the WTP threshold increased to $150,000/QALY, the INHB and INMB of pembrolizumab were 0.022 QALYs and $3,335, respectively, and the probability of pembrolizumab was 51.85%. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the models were sensitive to pembrolizumab and cemiplimab costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that treatment with pembrolizumab was related to a higher INHB in several subgroups, including patients with brain metastases at baseline. Our findings suggest that the WTP threshold should be considered when choosing between cemiplimab and pembrolizumab to treat advanced NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression. Reducing the cost of pembrolizumab may lead to valuable outcomes.",

Adults with stage IV/recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer without  At a minimum follow-up of 61.3 months, 5-year OS rates were 24% versus 14% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 19% versus 7% (PD-L1 < 1%). The median duration of response was 24.5 versus 6.7 months (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 19.4 versus 4.8 months (PD-L1 < 1%). Among patients surviving 5 years, 66% (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 64% (PD-L1 < 1%) were off nivolumab plus ipilimumab without initiating subsequent systemic anticancer treatment by the 5-year time point. Survival benefit continued after nivolumab plus ipilimumab discontinuation because of treatment-related adverse events, with a 5-year OS rate of 39% (combined PD-L1 \u2265 1% and < 1% populations). Quality of life in 5-year survivors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was similar to that in the general US population through the 5-year follow-up. No new safety signals were observed. With all patients off immunotherapy treatment for \u2265 3 years, nivolumab plus ipilimumab increased 5-year survivorship versus chemotherapy, including long-term, durable clinical benefit regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. These data support nivolumab plus ipilimumab as an effective first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.",

Based on the response and progression-free survival, patients were divided into 3 groups: Exceptional-responder (n\u00a0=\u00a027), Resistance (n\u00a0=\u00a0161), and Others (n\u00a0=\u00a025). Resistance group was further randomly partitioned into six non-overlapping sets (n\u00a0=\u00a026 or 27), while each partition was combined with Exceptional-responder and Others to make balanced datasets. We built machine learning models optimized for identifying Exceptional-responder via 3-group classification and constructed a panel of 45 microRNAs and 3 fields of clinical information. Machine learning models based on the selected panel achieved 0.81-0.89 (median 0.85) sensitivity and 0.52-0.71 (median 0.59) precision for Exceptional-responder in 3-group classification with 5-fold cross validation in all six datasets constructed, while conventional method relying on tumor PD-L1 immunohistochemistry achieved 0.44-0.44 sensitivity and 0.55-0.67 (median 0.62) precision.

This strategy lays on the capability of these mAbs to rescue tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) inactivated throughout PD-1 binding to PD-L1/2 in the tumor sites. This inhibitory interactive pathway is a physiological mechanism of prevention against dangerous overreactions and autoimmunity in case of prolonged and/or repeated CTL response to the same antigen peptides. Therefore, we have carried out a retrospective bioinformatics analysis by single-cell flow cytometry to evaluate if PD-1/PD-L1-blocking mAbs modulate the expression of specific peripheral immune cell subsets, potentially correlated with autoimmunity triggering in 28 mNSCLC patients.

Unfortunately, a considerable percentage of tumors do not completely respond to therapy, which has been associated with early disease progression. So far, it is impossible to predict these events due to lack of knowledge. In this study, we characterized the gene expression profile of tumor samples to identify new biomarkers and mechanisms behind tumor responses to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and disease recurrence after surgery. Tumor bulk RNA sequencing was performed in 16 pretreatment and 36 post-treatment tissue samples from 41 patients with resectable stage IIIA NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy from NADIM trial. A panel targeting 395 genes related to immunological processes was used. Tumors were classified as complete pathological response (CPR) and non-CPR, based on the total absence of viable tumor cells in tumor bed and lymph nodes tested at surgery. Differential-expressed genes between groups and pathway enrichment analysis were assessed using DESeq2 and gene set enrichment analysis. CIBERSORTx was used to estimate the proportions of immune cell subtypes. CPR tumors had a stronger pre-established immune infiltrate at baseline than non-CPR, characterized by higher levels of  Our results reinforce the differences between CPR and non-CPR responses, describing possible response and relapse immune mechanisms, opening the possibility of therapy personalization of immunotherapy-based regimens in the neoadjuvant setting of NSCLC.",

We also investigated clinical prognostic factors for the efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy, based on patient characteristics. In this prospective observational study, PS-2 and elderly NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651% who received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy, from October 2019 to March 2021, at 10 institutions in Japan were enrolled. Patients judged eligible by their physicians for combined chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment were excluded. Clinicopathological characteristics and adverse events were investigated for correlation with clinical outcomes. Forty patients were enrolled in the study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with PS 2 and those aged \u2265 75 years were 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-14.4) months and 5.3 (95% CI 2.9-9.4) months, respectively.

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were observed in 19 patients; 6 patients had severe irAEs of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher. Patients who achieved stable disease or better, had a statistically significant increase in PFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the acquisition of disease control with pembrolizumab monotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was relatively effective and tolerable as a first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1-positive advanced NSCLC who had poor PS or were elderly. Our results suggest that disease control might be an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in this population.

    "abstract": "Programmed death-ligand (PD-L) 1 and 2 are ligands of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor. They are members of the B7/CD28 ligand-receptor family and the most investigated inhibitory immune checkpoints at present. PD-L1 is the main effector in PD-1-reliant immunosuppression, as the PD-1/PD-L pathway is a key regulator for T-cell activation. Activation of T-cells warrants the upregulation of PD-1 and production of cytokines which also upregulate PD-L1 expression, creating a positive feedback mechanism that has an important role in the prevention of tissue destruction and development of autoimmunity. In the context of inadequate immune response, the prolonged antigen stimulation leads to chronic PD-1 upregulation and T-cell exhaustion. In lung cancer patients, PD-L1 expression levels have been of special interest since patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrate higher levels of expression and tend to respond more favorably to the evolving PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, alone as front-line single-agent therapy instead of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC and PD-L1 \u22651% expression and chemoimmunotherapy regimens are available for lower stage disease. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines also delineate treatment by low and high expression of PD-L1 in NSCLC. Thus, studying PD-L1 overexpression levels in the different histological subtypes of lung cancer can affect our approach to treating these patients. There is an evolving role of immunotherapy in the other sub-types of lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In addition, within the NSCLC category, squamous cell carcinomas and non-G12C KRAS mutant NSCLC have no specific targetable therapies to date. Therefore, assessment of the PD-L1 expression level among these subtypes of lung cancer is required, since lung cancer is one of the few malignances wherein PD-L1 expression levels is so crucial in determining the role of immunotherapy. In this study, we compared PD-L1 expression in lung cancer according to the histological subtype of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Cancers are highly complex diseases that are characterized by not only the overgrowth of malignant cells but also an altered immune response. The inhibition and reprogramming of the immune system play critical roles in tumor initiation and progression. Immunotherapy aims to reactivate antitumor immune cells and overcome the immune escape mechanisms of tumors. Represented by immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer, tumor immunotherapy has seen tremendous success in the clinic, with the capability to induce long-term regression of some tumors that are refractory to all other treatments. Among them, immune checkpoint blocking therapy, represented by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab) and CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab), has shown encouraging therapeutic effects in the treatment of various malignant tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. In addition, with the advent of CAR-T, CAR-M and other novel immunotherapy methods, immunotherapy has entered a new era. At present, evidence indicates that the combination of multiple immunotherapy methods may be one way to improve the therapeutic effect. However, the overall clinical response rate of tumor immunotherapy still needs improvement, which warrants the development of novel therapeutic designs as well as the discovery of biomarkers that can guide the prescription of these agents. Learning from the past success and failure of both clinical and basic research is critical for the rational design of studies in the future. In this article, we describe the efforts to manipulate the immune system against cancer and discuss different targets and cell types that can be exploited to promote the antitumor immune response.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is a standard-of-care for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for completely resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. In this randomised, triple-blind, phase 3 trial (PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091), patients were recruited from 196 medical centres in 29 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with completely resected, pathologically confirmed stage IB (tumours of \u22654 cm in diameter), II, or IIIA NSCLC per the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (7th edition) of any histology or PD-L1 expression level, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; adjuvant chemotherapy was to be considered for stage IB disease and was strongly recommended for stage II and IIIA disease, according to national and local guidelines. Using a central interactive voice-response system, eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a minimisation technique and stratified by disease stage, previous adjuvant chemotherapy, PD-L1 expression, and geographical region, to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 18 cycles. Participants, investigators, and analysts were masked to treatment assignment. Dual primary endpoints were disease-free survival in the overall population and in the population with PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all participants randomly assigned to a treatment group). Safety was assessed in all participants randomly assigned to treatment who received at least one dose of study treatment. Here we report results of the second interim analysis, prespecified to occur when approximately 118 disease-free survival events had occurred in the PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504372, and is active but not recruiting. Between Jan 20, 2016, and May 6, 2020, 1177 (60%) of 1955 screened participants were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=590, including n=168 with PD-L1 TPS of \u226550%) or placebo (n=587; including n=165 with PD-L1 TPS of \u226550%) and included in the ITT population. Median follow-up as of data cutoff (Sept 20, 2021) for this interim analysis was 35\u00b76 months (IQR 27\u00b71-45\u00b75). In the overall population, median disease-free survival was 53\u00b76 months (95% CI 39\u00b72 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 42\u00b70 months (31\u00b73 to not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0\u00b776 [95% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b791], p=0\u00b70014). In the PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater population, median disease-free survival was not reached in either the pembrolizumab group (95% CI 44\u00b73 to not reached) or the placebo group (95% CI 35\u00b78 to not reached; HR 0\u00b782 [95% CI 0\u00b757-1\u00b718]; p=0\u00b714). Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 198 (34%) of 580 participants who received pembrolizumab and 150 (26%) of 581 participants who received placebo. Grade 3 or worse events that occurred in at least ten participants in either treatment group were hypertension (35 [6%]) and pneumonia (12 [2%]) with pembrolizumab and hypertension (32 [6%]) with placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 142 (24%) participants in the pembrolizumab group and 90 (15%) in the placebo group; serious adverse events that occurred in more than 1% of participants were pneumonia (13 [2%]), pneumonitis (12 [2%]), and diarrhoea (seven [1%]) with pembrolizumab and pneumonia (nine [2%]) with placebo. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (1%) participants treated with pembrolizumab (one due to both cardiogenic shock and myocarditis, one due to both septic shock and myocarditis, one due to pneumonia, and one due to sudden death) and in no participants treated with placebo. Pembrolizumab significantly improved disease-free survival compared with placebo and was not associated with new safety signals in completely resected, PD-L1-unselected, stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. Pembrolizumab is potentially a new treatment option for stage IB-IIIA NSCLC after complete resection and, when recommended, adjuvant chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression.

    "abstract": "Recently, the Patras Immunotherapy Score (PIOS) has been developed to estimate the survival benefit of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The aim of this study was to validate the clinical value of PIOS in an external cohort of aNSCLC patients. PIOS is a baseline formula produced by the combination of performance status, body mass index, age and line of treatment. In this multicentre study, 626 patients with confirmed NSCLC pathology, who had been treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, as well as 444 patients with aNSCLC, who had been managed with chemotherapy alone, were retrospectively enrolled. Predictive and prognostic values of PIOS were finally evaluated. Patients treated with immunotherapy and higher PIOS score had an improved progression-free survival not only in univariate [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.621,  This study provides further validation of PIOS in aNSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy.",

As immunotherapy is widely used in clinical practice, its efficacy and survival should be investigated in patients with DM. We retrospectively recruited 266 locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients who received pembrolizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients' clinicopathological data, including age, history of DM, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), genetic tumor profiling, and survival data were collected. Associations between clinical characteristics and survival were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. In this cohort, 15.04% (40/266) of the patients had a history of DM.

For dose-finding, requirements were non-central nervous system primary solid tumor, intolerant to/progressed after \u22651 line of treatment, and eligible for pembrolizumab; for expansion: (i) gastric/gastroesophageal junction tumor, intolerant to/progressed after first-line treatment, and no prior anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy; (ii) bladder/urothelial tumor, intolerant to/progressed after first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and no prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy; (iii) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Patients received eprenetapopt 4.5 g/day intravenously (IV) on days 1-4 with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 3 in each 21-day cycle. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), adverse events (AEs), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of eprenetapopt. Forty patients were enrolled (median age 66 years; range 27-85) and 37 received eprenetapopt plus pembrolizumab. No DLTs were reported and the RP2D for eprenetapopt in combination was 4.5 g/day IV on days 1-4. The most common eprenetapopt-related AEs were dizziness (35.1%), nausea (32.4%), and vomiting (29.7%). AEs leading to eprenetapopt discontinuation occurred in 2/37 patients (5.4%). In efficacy-assessable patients (n\u00a0= 29), one achieved complete response (urothelial cancer), two achieved partial responses (NSCLC, urothelial cancer), and six patients had stable disease.

In the context of chemo-IO, our study aims to compare platinum-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab combination to platinum-doublet alone in patients with low PD-L1 (<50%). We retrospectively collected medical records from patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1<50%, consecutively treated at our Centre from 2016 to 2021. Patients were grouped according to 1L treatment received: chemo-IO (group A) or platinum-doublet (group B). Survival outcomes were analyzed and compared among the two groups. Overall, 105 patients were included: 49 in group A and 56 in group B. At data cut-off, median follow-up was 12.4 and 34.8 months, with 32/49 and 52/56 events for progression-free survival (PFS) and 21/49 and 29/56 events for overall survival (OS), respectively. No difference in PFS was observed between group B and group A (6.6 versus 8 months, HR 1.12, 95%CI 0.57-1.40). Patients receiving 1L platinum-doublet had significantly longer OS compared to those receiving chemo-IO (median OS 23.8 vs 14.9 months, HR 0.47, 95% CI 1.15- 3.98, p=0.01). 12 month-OS was 58% (95% CI 44-76%) in group A and 78% (95% CI 68-91%) in group B (p=0.040). Subgroup analysis identified KRAS G12C mutation as potentially affecting PFS in patients receiving chemo-IO (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0-10-0.91). The OS benefit of platinum-doublet was consistent across subgroups, with particular benefit in female sex, liver or pleural metastases, PD-L1 negative. Overall, only 46.9% of patients with progression received subsequent treatment in group A (15/32), compared to 86.5% in group B (45/52, all receiving 2L IO), with no difference in PFS to 2L (group A 3.7months, group B 4.1months, p=0.3). Despite small study population and differential follow-up, our study demonstrates that sequential use of 1L platinum-doublet and 2L IO is not inferior to 1L chemo-IO in non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1<50%. In addition, we identified subgroups who might benefit differentially from the two approaches.",

Specifically, single-agent pembrolizumab as first-line therapy is approved for tumors with high expression of PD-L1 (\u226550%) while immunotherapy and chemotherapy are approved for any PD-L1.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been developed as cornerstones of cancer therapy, but the growing use of ICIs has induced immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Immune-related colitis, which is one of the most common irAEs, generally occurs 2-4 months after ICI treatment initiation and can be life threatening. Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate management are required. A rare autopsy case of nivolumab-related severe colitis that occurred 34 months after the start of treatment and recurred despite temporal remission with corticosteroids and infliximab is presented. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of late-onset irAEs in patients on receiving long-term ICI treatment.",

The primary objective of this trial is to establish the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of CIMAvax-EGF in combination with nivolumab as second-line therapy for NSCLC. Patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-naive metastatic NSCLC were enrolled using a \"3+3\" dose-escalation design. Toxicities were graded according to CTCAE V4.03. Thirteen patients (one unevaluable), the majority with PD-L1 0%, were enrolled into two dose levels of CIMAvax-EGF. The combination was determined to be safe and tolerable. The recommended phase 2 dose of CIMAvax-EGF was 2.4\u00a0mg. Humoral response to CIMAvax-EGF was achieved earlier and in a greater number of patients with the combination compared to historical control. Four out of 12 evaluable patients had an objective response.",

    "abstract": "A prior study found that, among advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients with PD-L1 expression 50% to 100% receiving immunotherapy as monotherapy, PD-L1 expression \u2265 90% was associated with longer survival. We sought to replicate this finding using real-world data from community oncology practices across the US. Retrospective cohort study of aNSCLC patients who initiated pembrolizumab monotherapy for first line and had a PD-L1 expression \u2265 50% using a nationwide, deidentified longitudinal electronic health record-derived real-world database. The exposure of interest was very high PD-L1 expression, which was defined as \u2265 90%, compared to high PD-L1 expression, defined as 50% to 89%. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from initiation of pembrolizumab to date of death, with censoring at last healthcare encounter. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing covariates. Propensity score-based inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to address confounding in Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models. The cohort included 1952 aNSCLC patients receiving first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. Half of cohort members were female, median age was 73 years (interquartile range, 65-80), 71% had non-squamous histology, 94% had a history of smoking, and 46% had very high PD-L1 expression. Median overall survival in the propensity score-weighted sample was 15.84 months for very high PD-L1 expression and 12.72 months for high PD-L1 expression. Having a very high PD-L1 expression was associated with lower hazard of mortality (IPW hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91). In this large national US cohort, patients with very high PD-L1 expression (\u2265 90%) aNSCLC receiving first-line pembrolizumab experienced better median survival than those with high PD-L1 expression (50% to 89%).",

    "title": "Does Molecular Profiling of ",
    "abstract": "Background: Several studies suggest that patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC fail to benefit from standard systemic therapies and do not respond to EGFR inhibitors. Most recently, KRAS 12c data suggest specific treatment for improving ORR and OS. There is a clear need for therapies specifically developed for these patients. Moreover, data that might be suggestive of a response to specific therapies, such as BRCA1, are needed, and two mutations that were studied in other malignancies show more response to PARP inhibitors. Molecular profiling has the potential to identify other potential targets that may provide better treatment and novel targeted therapy for KRAS-mutated NSCLC. Methods: We purified RNA from archived tissues of patients with stage I and II NSCLC with wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) KRAS tumors; paired normal tissue adjacent to the tumor from 20 and 17 patients, respectively, and assessed, using real-time reverse transcriptase\u2212polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression of four genes involved in DNA synthesis and repair, including thymidylate synthase (TS), BRCA1, ECCR1, RAP80, and the proto-oncogene SRC. Additionally, we assessed the expression of PD-L1 in mt KRAS tumors with immunohistochemistry using an antibody against PD-L1. Results: Our results show that in mtKRAS tumors, the level of expression of ERCC1, TS, and SRC was significantly increased in comparison to paired normal lung tissue (p \u2264 0.04). The expression of BRCA1 and RAP80 was similar in both mt KRAS tumors and paired normal tissue. Furthermore, the expression of BRCA1, TS, and SRC was significantly increased in wt KRAS tumors relative to their expression in the normal lung tissue (p < 0.044). The expression of ERCC1 and RAP80 was similar in wt KRAS tumors and paired normal tissue. Interestingly, SRC expression in mtKRAS tumors was decreased in comparison to wt KRAS tumors. Notably, there was an expression of PD-L1 in the tumor and stromal cells in a few (5 out of 20) mtKRAS tumors. Our results suggest that a greater ERCC1 expression in mt KRAS tumors might increase platinum resistance in this group of patients, whereas the greater expression of BRCA1 in wt KRAS tumor might be suggestive of the sensitivity of taxanes. Our data also suggest that the combination of an SRC inhibitor with a TS inhibitor, such as pemetrexed, might improve the outcome of patients with NSCLC and in particular, patients with wt KRAS tumors. PD-L1 expression in tumors, and especially stromal cells, suggests a better outcome. Conclusion: mt KRAS NSCLC patients might benefit from a treatment strategy that targets KRAS in combination with therapeutic agents based on pharmacogenomic markers, such as SRC and BRCA1. mtKRAS tumors are likely to be platinum-, taxane-, and pemetrexed-resistant, as well as having a low level of PD-L1 expression; thus, they are less likely to receive single-agent immunotherapy, such as pembrolizumab, as the first-line therapy. wt KRAS tumors with BRCA1 positivity tend to be sensitive to taxane therapy and, potentially, platinum. Our results suggest the need to develop targeted therapies for KRAS-mutant NSCLC or combine the targeting of oncogenic KRAS in addition to other therapeutic agents specific to the molecular profile of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoprogression, the initial apparent worsening of cancer prior to eventual improvement, is a documented feature of immune checkpoint inhibitor administration and presents a challenge to clinicians distinguishing true progression from pseudoprogression. This phenomenon does not typically occur with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We present a case in which a patient treated with combination carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab experienced transient radiographic worsening of disease with subsequent regression. A 65-year-old never-smoking white male with advanced sarcomatoid non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a MET exon 14 skipping mutation and with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 80% was initiated on combination chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy after progression on a MET inhibitor. After two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, repeat imaging suggested disease progression. Following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy levels, which were attributed to the waning of treatment-associated toxicities. On the day prior to initiation of the next planned line of therapy, repeat imaging was preformed to provide a baseline for treatment efficacy. Imaging revealed improvement compared to the prior imaging. Chemotherapy with carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab was resumed, with response ongoing 8\u00a0months later. Pseudoprogression is a documented feature of ICI administration. Pseudoprogression is not typically observed in patients treated with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and has not yet been documented in patients treated with combination cytotoxic chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. At this time, there are no reliable means to predict or diagnose these rare events; therefore, more studies should be conducted to understand which patients are predisposed to developing this phenomenon and to increase clinical recognition.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent and unmet need for more effective treatment options for patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on platinum-based therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and targeted therapies. Currently, the combination of docetaxel (D) and ramucirumab (R) is the next best salvage therapy with a modest historical progression free survival (PFS) of 4.5 months and 6-month PFS rate of 37%\u00a0predating the era of ICI\u00a0use. Anecdotal reports in patients who progressed on ICI suggest a higher response rate to docetaxel compared to historical experience. Furthermore, tumor related angiogenesis promotes tumor growth and may contribute to immune escape in patients treated with ICI. Therapeutic combination with anti-angiogenic, ICI, and chemotherapy have independently demonstrated clinical efficacy without additive toxicities in NSCLC patients. This multicenter, single arm, open label, phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of docetaxel 75 mg/m This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICI combined with docetaxel and ramucirumab.

Here, we report a rare case of an abdominal fibroinflammatory reaction that affected multiple organs during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy using pembrolizumab in a non-small-cell lung cancer patient. The patient's case demonstrates that immunotherapy-related abdominal fibroinflammatory reactions need to be considered, especially for patients with a history of pre-existing conditions in the abdomen.

    "abstract": "Assessment of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has emerged as an important predictive biomarker across multiple tumor types. However, manual quantitation of PD-L1 positivity can be difficult and leads to substantial inter-observer variability. Although the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may mitigate some of the challenges associated with manual assessment and improve the accuracy of PD-L1 expression scoring, use of AI-based approaches to oncology biomarker scoring and drug development has been sparse, primarily due to the lack of large-scale clinical validation studies across multiple cohorts and tumor types. We developed AI-powered algorithms to evaluate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by IHC and compared it with manual IHC scoring in urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (prospectively determined during the phase II and III CheckMate clinical trials). 1,746 slides were retrospectively analyzed, the largest investigation of digital pathology algorithms on clinical trial datasets performed to date. AI-powered quantification of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells identified more PD-L1-positive samples compared with manual scoring at cutoffs of \u22651% and \u22655% in most tumor types. Additionally, similar improvements in response and survival were observed in patients identified as PD-L1-positive compared with PD-L1-negative using both AI-powered and manual methods, while improved associations with survival were observed in patients with certain tumor types identified as PD-L1-positive using AI-powered scoring only. Our study demonstrates the potential for implementation of digital pathology-based methods in future clinical practice to identify more patients who would benefit from treatment with immuno-oncology therapy compared with current guidelines using manual assessment.",

As already happened for the advanced disease, also early stages have entered the era of precision medicine, with molecular analysis and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) evaluation that by now can be considered a routine assessment. New treatment options have been recently approved, with osimertinib now part of clinical practice for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutated (EGFRm) patients, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) available after FDA approval both in the adjuvant (atezolizumab) and neoadjuvant (nivolumab) setting. No mature data on overall survival benefits are available yet, though. Several clinical trials with specific-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and ICIs are currently ongoing, both with and without concomitant chemotherapy. As therapeutic strategies are rapidly expanding, quite a few questions remain unsettled, such as the optimal duration of adjuvant targeted therapy or the effective benefit of ICIs in early-stage EGFRm or ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) rearranged patients, or the possibility to individuate high-risk patients after surgical resection assessing minimal residual disease (MRD) by ctDNA evaluation. We hereby report already available literature data and summarize ongoing trials with targeted therapy and immunotherapy in early-stage NSCLC, focusing on practice-changing results and new perspectives for potentially cured patients.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is licensed for the treatment of pre-treated and PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but response is heterogeneous. In this context, the Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) has been proposed as tool to prognosticate outcome. To investigate the real-world efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in pre-treated NSCLC patients and the clinical utility of LIPI for patients' selection. Patients with pre-treated NSCLC and PD-L1 \u2265 1% treated with pembrolizumab were included in this retrospective series. The LIPI was used to classify patients in 3 prognostics subgroups according to the pre-treatment dNLR (derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) and LDH in blood. The prognostic impact of the LIPI on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated with Cox regression. The combined effect of LIPI and other relevant prognostic factors was explored with multivariate regression. In total, 113 consecutive patients were included. Median (mPFS) and mOS was 4.3 (2.6-6.7) and 13.5 (10.3-17.7) months, respectively. Good-, intermediate-, and poor-LIPI was found in 54 (47.8%), 45 (39.8%), and 8 (7.1%) patients, respectively. Median PFS was 5.1 (2.8-9.1), 3.0 (2.5-6.8), and 1.4 (0.5-18.7) months, and mOS was 17.2 (12.0-26.4), 11.8 (8.4-17.1), and 3.7 (0.5-not calculable) months for good-, intermediate-, and poor-LIPI group, respectively. Patients with intermediate-LIPI and poor-LIPI had worse PFS versus good-LIPI, and statistically significant worse OS (p = 0.030 and p = 0.013, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, intermediate- versus good-LIPI (p = 0.190) was not independently associated to PFS or OS. Patients with both good-LIPI and high (\u2265 50%) PD-L1 had better OS than all other subgroups defined by LIPI and PD-L1. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in 47 (41.6%) patients (12.4% grade \u2265 3). In a time-varying analysis, irAEs were statistically associated with longer OS (HR 0.51, 0.31-0.84; p = 0.008). In our series, the outcome of pembrolizumab in pre-treated NSCLC is consistent with the registration trial. Lung Immune Prognostic Index is a readily available tool able to prognosticate outcome, also in PD-L1-high patients. The positive association between irAEs and OS might aid decision making.",

    "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is associated with poor treatment outcome in patients with NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs and chemotherapy (ICI/Chemo) combination therapy is currently the standard therapy for NSCLC, and some ICI/Chemo regimens for nonsquamous (non-Sq) NSCLC contain bevacizumab (BEV), which is effective for controlling MPE and may enhance immune response. This study aimed to determine the optimal first-line treatment for this clinical population. We retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients with non-Sq NSCLC with MPE who received ICI/Chemo or pembrolizumab monotherapy. Treatment outcomes were analyzed in patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score more than or equal to 50% who were administered ICI/Chemo or pembrolizumab monotherapy (PD-L1 high cohort) and in patients with any PD-L1 status, treated with ICI/Chemo with or without BEV (ICI/Chemo cohort). We used propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce bias. PD-L1 high and ICI/Chemo cohorts included 143 and 139 patients, respectively. In PD-L1 high cohort, 37 patients received ICI/Chemo. With PSM, the median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ICI/Chemo group than in the pembrolizumab group (11.1 versus 3.9 mo, respectively,  ICI/Chemo seemed more effective than pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with non-Sq NSCLC with MPE. Nevertheless, the synergistic effect of BEV with ICI/Chemo may be limited. Further studies are needed to clarify the key factor in the tumor-induced immunosuppression environment in these patients.",

    "abstract": "The development\u00a0of immune checkpoint inhibitors is considered to be one of the most important advances in cancer treatment. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) receptor that has demonstrated antineoplastic activity against various malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.\u00a0Pembrolizumab has been associated with significant dermatological adverse reactions, referred to as immune-related adverse events. The cutaneous adverse effects can affect the quality of life of the patient and can result in dose reduction or even discontinuation of the treatment. Hence it is of utmost importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the cutaneous toxicities for prompt initiation of treatment. We present the case of a 49-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 100% PD-L1 expression, who suffered\u00a0a severe cutaneous reaction involving more than 95% of body surface area, following the first dose of pembrolizumab. He was treated with low-dose systemic steroids (prednisone 10 mg), to which he responded well. Since the patient showed excellent symptomatic and clinical response to pembrolizumab, it was not discontinued. The patient has not developed a rash with subsequent doses of pembrolizumab, and the steroids were tapered off.",

In a phase III trial, cemiplimab demonstrated significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)  Relevant RCTs were identified by searching databases and conference proceedings as per ISPOR, NICE, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. NMA with time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) was performed for OS and PFS. Analyses were conducted for objective response rate (ORR) and safety/tolerability. Fixed-effect models were used due to limited evidence. Various sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the base case analyses. The feasibility assessment determined that EMPOWER-Lung 1, KEYNOTE-024, and KEYNOTE-042 trials were eligible. IMpower110 was excluded because an incompatible PD-L1 assay (SP142) was used for patient selection.

    "abstract": "NCCN guidelines for first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without targetable driver alterations includes either immunotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated genomic predictors of survival after immunotherapy to guide this treatment decision. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify genomic correlates of survival in a cohort of EGFR/ALK-, non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy (mono-IO) or pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin/cisplatin and pemetrexed (chemo-IO) within a real-world clinico-genomic database. The effect of deletions on 9p21 was further evaluated in five additional tumor types. Among mono-IO treated non-squamous NSCLC patients, tumors with 9p21.3 gene deletions (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP) were associated with worse survival compared to the corresponding deletion-negative tumors (CDKN2A deletion HR\u2009=\u20091.8, P\u2009=\u20090.001). However, this association was not observed among chemo-IO treated patients (CDKN2A deletion HR\u2009=\u20091.1, P\u2009=\u20090.4). This finding remained after adjusting for clinical and genomic features including TMB and PD-L1. Deletions at 9p21.3 were not associated with differences in TMB, PD-L1, or tumor inflammation. Due to the high incidence of 9p21.3 deletions across tumor types, we performed a pan-cancer analysis and found CDKN2A deletion-positive tumors had worse survival following first-line immunotherapy treatment in multiple tumor types (HR\u2009=\u20091.4, P\u2009<\u20090.001). These results indicate deletions at 9p21.3 are a putative negative predictor of clinical benefit from first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors and may have utility in choosing between mono-IO vs chemo-IO regimens in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Few real-world data are available in patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with first-line immunotherapy, particularly in those with brain metastases at treatment initiation. This was a national, retrospective, multicenter study that consecutively included all patients with PD-L1-positive (tumor proportion score\u2009\u2265\u200950%) advanced NSCLC who initiated first-line treatment with pembrolizumab as a single agent between May 2017 (date of availability of pembrolizumab in this indication in France) to November 22, 2019 (approval of the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy combination). Data were collected from medical records with local response assessment. The cohort included 845 patients and 176 (20.8%) had brain metastases at diagnosis.

    "abstract": "We aim to determine the feasibility of a novel radiomic biomarker that can integrate with other established clinical prognostic factors to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing first-line immunotherapy. Our study includes 107 patients with stage 4 NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab-based therapy (monotherapy: 30%, combination chemotherapy: 70%). The ITK-SNAP software was used for 3D tumor volume segmentation from pre-therapy CT scans. Radiomic features (n\u2009=\u2009102) were extracted using the CaPTk software. Impact of heterogeneity introduced by image physical dimensions (voxel spacing parameters) and acquisition parameters (contrast enhancement and CT reconstruction kernel) was mitigated by resampling the images to the minimum voxel spacing parameters and harmonization by a nested ComBat technique. This technique was initialized with radiomic features, clinical factors of age, sex, race, PD-L1 expression, ECOG status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, recurrence event and months of progression-free survival, and image acquisition parameters as batch variables. Two phenotypes were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of harmonized features. Prognostic factors, including PDL1 expression, ECOG status, BMI and smoking status, were combined with radiomic phenotypes in Cox regression models of PFS and Kaplan Meier (KM) curve-fitting. Cox model based on clinical factors had a c-statistic of 0.57, which increased to 0.63 upon addition of phenotypes derived from harmonized features. There were statistically significant differences in survival outcomes stratified by clinical covariates, as measured by the log-rank test (p\u2009=\u20090.034), which improved upon addition of phenotypes (p\u2009=\u20090.00022). We found that mitigation of heterogeneity by image resampling and nested ComBat harmonization improves prognostic value of phenotypes, resulting in better prediction of PFS when added to other prognostic variables.",

However, clinical trials are often designed to provide the best chance for a trial drug/intervention to demonstrate effectiveness. Therefore, they usually include relatively healthier patients compared to what clinicians see in their practice. To demonstrate the efficacy of a drug outside a clinical trial, a real-world analysis is performed, which is\u00a0reported in this article. We analyzed lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy at our institution and found comparable efficacy to reported clinical trials. This was important because the trials did not include any patients from our country. We also found that patients with fewer sites of involvement outside the lung and those who received radiotherapy to the lung (either during or before receiving immunotherapy) survived longer without disease progression.",

In the present retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of patients with advanced NSCLC who received cancer immunotherapy as first-line systemic therapy.

A total of 157 patients were included in the present study (75 treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy; 82, pembrolizumab monotherapy). Multivariate analysis for PFS revealed that PD-L1 tumor proportion scores <50%, a total target lesion diameter \u226576\u2009mm, and cancer cachexia were independently associated with poor PFS. Multivariate analysis for OS revealed that \u22654 metastases and cancer cachexia were significantly associated with poor OS.

A partitioned survival model was developed to predict costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in a NIV + IPI arm and a chemotherapy arm. Data on overall survival and progression-free survival were derived from the CheckMate\u00a0227 trial. Cost estimates were based on a Japanese healthcare system perspective using real-world data from the JMDC claims database. Utilities were derived from published sources outside Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NIV + IPI therapy compared with chemotherapy was estimated. A scenario analysis on the level of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was conducted. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty in parameter settings. Compared with chemotherapy, NIV + IPI therapy incurred an additional cost of USD102,623 and conferred an additional 1.007 QALY, which resulted in an ICER of USD101,950/QALY gained. Contrary to prior expectations, the ICER of patients with a PD-L1 expression level \u2265 1% was higher than that of patients with a PD-L1 expression level < 1% (USD145,868/QALY and USD127,737/QALY, respectively). Sensitivity analyses showed a relatively robust result with the ICERs remaining higher than a Japanese price adjustment threshold of USD75,000/QALY with a few exceptions. The combination of NIV + IPI as first-line therapy would not be cost effective under a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD75,000/QALY from the perspective of the Japanese healthcare system.",

Principally a failure of IL-10 producing regulatory B cells as demonstrated through functional ex vivo assays and deep phenotyping mass cytometric analysis, is a major and significant finding in patients who develop high-grade irAEs when undergoing treatment with anti-PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade. There is currently a lack of biomarkers to identify a priori those patients at greatest risk of developing severe auto-inflammatory syndrome. Pre-therapy B cell profiling could provide an important tool to identify lung cancer patients at high risk of developing severe irAEs on checkpoint blockade.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death or ligand-1 (PD-(L)1) pathway inhibitors confer improved survival as the first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) in patients with PD-L1 expression (PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e\u2009\u2265\u200950%) compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy and have become a standard therapy. Some recent evidence suggests that among aNSCLC patients with PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e of \u226550% receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, very high levels of PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e (\u226590%) may be associated with better outcomes. We sought to assess whether very high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e (\u226590%) compared to high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e (50%-89%) is associated with an overall survival benefit in aNSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapies. We conducted a single-site retrospective cohort study of aNSCLC patients who initiated PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy as the first-line treatment from October 24, 2016, to August 25, 2021, and had a PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e\u2009\u2265\u200950%. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from the start of the first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy (index date) to date of death or last confirmed activity prior to the cohort exit date. Propensity score-based inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to control for confounding in Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. One hundred sixty-six patients with aNSCLC receiving PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy met inclusion criteria. 54% were female, 90% received pembrolizumab, median age was 68\u2009years, 70% had non-squamous cell carcinoma, 94% had a history of smoking, 29% had a KRAS mutation, and 37% had very high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e. Unweighted covariates at cohort entry were similar between groups (absolute standardized mean differences [SMDs] <0.1) except for race (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.2); age at therapy initiation (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.13); smoking status (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.13), and BRAF mutation status (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.11). After weighting, baseline covariates were well balanced (all absolute SMDs <0.1). In the weighted analysis, having a very high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e was associated with lower mortality (weighted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.90) and longer median survival: 3.85 versus 1.49\u2009years. Very high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e (\u226590%) was associated with an overall survival benefit over high PD-L1\u2009+\u2009e (50%-89%) in patients receiving the first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy in a model controlling for potential confounders. These findings should be confirmed in a larger real-world data set.",

Among the 11 patients who died, five were from the NK groups (41.6%, n\u00a0=\u00a05/12), and six received pembrolizumab monotherapy (100%, n\u00a0=\u00a06/6). The estimated 2-year survival rate was 58.3% versus 16.7% (pembrolizumab plus SNK01 vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy). The hazard ratio of pembrolizumab plus SNK01 compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.1, 1.08, p-value: 0.066). Although the median PFS was significantly higher in the pembrolizumab plus SNK01 group than in the pembrolizumab alone group, OS and PFS did not differ statistically between patients who received low doses of NK cells and those who received high doses of NK cells. Autologous NK cells can enhance the long-term OS and PFS for NSCLC. A larger study is needed to confirm this result. Clinical Research Information Service number: KCT0003463.",

    "abstract": "Although advances have been made in cancer immunotherapy, patient benefits remain elusive. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have shown survival benefit compared to chemotherapy. Personalization of treatment would be facilitated by a priori identification of patients likely to benefit. This pilot study applied a suite of machine learning methods to analyze mass cytometry data of immune cell lineage and surface markers from blood samples of a small cohort (n= 13) treated with Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, or Nivolumab as monotherapy. Four different comparisons were evaluated between data collected at an initial visit (baseline), after 12-weeks of immunotherapy, and from healthy (control) samples: healthy vs patients at baseline, Responders vs Non-Responders at baseline, Healthy vs 12-week Responders, and Responders vs Non-Responders at 12-weeks. The algorithms Random Forest, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Elastic Net were applied to find features differentiating between these groups and provide for the capability to predict outcomes. Particular combinations and proportions of immune cell lineage and surface markers were sufficient to accurately discriminate between the groups without overfitting the data. In particular, markers associated with the B-cell phenotype were identified as key features. This study illustrates a comprehensive machine learning analysis of circulating immune cell characteristics of NSCLC patients with the potential to predict response to immunotherapy. Upon further evaluation in a larger cohort, the proposed methodology could help guide personalized treatment selection in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "While the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as pembrolizumab has significantly improved survival for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there remains a need for improved predictive and prognostic biomarkers. We conducted a retrospective, 3-center study using electronic medical record data for patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, between 2014 and 2019. We categorized variables as covariates or confounders. Covariates, which were the focus of analysis due to their emerging prognostic value, included pretreatment body mass index (BMI), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albumin, and antibiotic exposure. Confounders, which highlighted characteristics for each patient and their cancer, included sex, age at start of immunotherapy, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, performance status (PS), tumor mutational burden and whether pembrolizumab was given as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. The association between these variables with time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models. One hundred thirty-six patients were included in our study. Antibiotics usage, serum albumin, and NLR have univariate relationships with TTF. Serum albumin, NLR, and BMI were associated with OS in univariate analyses. In our multivariate analysis, antibiotic usage had a strong negative association with TTF when adjusting for all 6 confounders. Pretreatment usage of antibiotics, as well as albumin, NLR, and BMI have potential to predict treatment outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first-line immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Advanced non-small cell lung cancer has poor prognosis and low survival. Immunotherapy with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is a relatively new method of treatment that offers a chance to significantly extend the survival and quality of life of patients over that obtained with conventional chemotherapy. One of the complications of immunotherapy is immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. CASE REPORT We analyzed the available medical data on the treatment of 22 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated in our clinic and qualified for immunotherapy with one of the anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents: nivolumab, atezolizumab, or pembrolizumab. In this group of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, 4 patients experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of immune therapy. It can manifest in many ways, from asymptomatic to severe cases, which require quick action and treatment. Knowing the spectrum of symptoms and being alert to the possibility of such a complication is an important skill for doctors who use immunotherapy in their patients.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies to checkpoint inhibitors against the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is a landmark achievement in cancer therapy. Some anti-PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown clinical success, in a percentage of patients with prolonged survival rates. However, adverse effects accompany these benefits. In this case, strategies with lower toxicity and increased specificity are urgently required. Cancer vaccines have the ability to stimulate the native immune system and in particular, an engineered B-cell epitope can elicit high-affinity polyclonal antibodies with similar efficacy to PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in murine animal models. We have previously designed and synthesized a unique B-cell vaccine, PD1-Vaxx [MVF-PD-1(92-110)], and we have tested the immunogenicity and antitumor properties in CT26 colon cancer BALB/c syngeneic mice model. This manuscript provides results from comprehensive preclinical pharmacology studies encompassing primary and secondary pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, and safety studies. The results from these preclinical studies support the use of PD1-Vaxx in a first-in-human clinical trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Sixty-four consecutive patients in Taiwan receiving pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC between 2018 and 2020 were recruited in this study.

Additionally, 12 predictors, including pembrolizumab regimen, dose, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), age, sex, histopathology, smoking history, ECOG PS, EGFR mutation, PD-L1 expression, distant metastases and treatment line, were analyzed in multivariable Cox models for predicting OS and PFS. The results showed that the MD group and the SD group had similar OS and PFS, especially in patients beyond first-line treatment or with a pretreatment NLR < 5. The NLR was the only independent factor associated with both OS (adjusted HR = 0.052; p = 0.010) and PFS (adjusted HR = 0.259; p = 0.021).

Although results from newly published trials suggest that checkpoint inhibition may be useful in a subgroup of patients, there are no clear criteria for PD-L1 score in SGCs. Chemotherapy benefits were observed to be limited, with a dismal prognosis in unresectable and high-grade SGC. Immunotherapies have demonstrated extraordinary efficacy in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has been shown to have potent anti-tumor action in a number of clinical trials. We report a unique case of advanced high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid salivary gland after Pembrolizumab treatment as a first line therapy. The tumor was downstaged as a result of the pembrolizumab treatment, allowing for a successful surgical excision with no facial nerve sacrifice and no major neoadjuvant treatment adverse effects, and the final specimen pathology was tumor-free. In these types of malignancies, a similar technique resulted in a complete response (CR) radiologically and pathologically has never been discussed before. In pretreated patients with high-grade salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma, pembrolizumab showed good anticancer activity and provided a clinically, radiologically, and pathological response with a viable treatment choice. More research is needed to bring Pembrolizumab to the front-line of treatment. The time and duration of medication should be compared to the time required for surgery in these investigations.",

We performed a systematic literature search to identify all potentially eligible studies in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until August 7, 2021. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the second outcome was treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). We used random-effects model to conduct direct and network meta-analyses, which were performed by using RevMan 5.3 and R version 3.6.1, respectively. Direct meta-analysis suggested that atezolizumab, cemiplimab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab significantly improved OS compared with chemotherapy (CT), and NMA further established that atezolizumab [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; 95% CrI, 0.62-0.96], nivolumab (HR, 0.75; 95% CrI, 0.62-0.93), or pembrolizumab (HR, 0.71; 95% Credible interval (Crl), 0.57-0.89) significantly and cemiplimab (HR, 0.68; 95% CrI, 0.46-1.02) numerically improved OS compared with CT. Meanwhile, NMA also indicated that cemiplimab was numerically superior to other PD-1/PD-L1 agents. Moreover, avelumab, atezolizumab, cemiplimab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab were found to have fewer TRAEs compared with CT in direct meta-analysis, which were supported by the results from the NMA. Meanwhile, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and ranking probability suggested that cemiplimab provided the most favorable balance between efficacy and safety, with the first ranking for the OS. Based on available evidence, cemiplimab may have the most favorable risk-benefit ratio for NSCLC patients compared with other common therapeutic management. However, future research with a large-scale, high-quality, and mature follow-up is needed to further determine which agents should be preferentially selected for NSCLC patients due to the limitations of our NMA and variations of eligible studies in treatment line and PD-L1 status.",

Alliance A082002 is based on subgroup analysis from the randomized phase II PEMBRO-RT trial., PEMBRO-RT compared pembrolizumab alone or with SBRT and revealed improved progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) in PD-L1(-) patients when adding SBRT (8 Gy x 3 fractions). In A082002, patients without PD-L1 expression will be randomized to SBRT (8 Gy x3) plus systemic therapy vs. systemic therapy alone. The primary endpoint of the phase II portion of the trial is PFS and will require 100 patients. The primary endpoint of the phase III portion of the trial is OS and will require an additional 284 patients. This trial will clarify whether adding SBRT to systemic therapy can improve PFS and OS in a larger multi-institutional cohort. Several systemic treatment options are allowed including either immunotherapy alone or chemo-immunotherapy. This phase II/III Alliance trial A082002 will test whether the addition of SBRT to a single tumor site will enhance the anti-tumor activity of systemic immunotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy in patients with stage IV PD-L1(-) NSCLC. It is now open in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).",

    "abstract": "This post-marketing surveillance (PMS) was initiated in Japan to identify factors affecting the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. This PMS was conducted from December 2016 to June 2019 at 717 centers across Japan. Patients with unresectable advanced/recurrent NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line (1L) treatment for PD-L1-expressing tumors (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS]\u2009\u2265\u200950%) or second-line or later (2L+) treatment for tumors with PD-L1 TPS\u2009\u2265\u20091% were enrolled and followed up for 1\u00a0year. Of 2805 registered patients, 2740 and 2400 comprised the safety and effectiveness analysis sets, respectively. The median age (range) was 69 (27-92) years; 55.7% and 29.2% of patients experienced treatment-related adverse events and adverse events of special interest (AEOSIs), respectively. More common AEOSIs included interstitial lung disease, endocrine disorders, liver dysfunction, colitis/severe diarrhea, infusion reactions, and severe skin disorders. The frequency of experiencing \u22652 AEOSIs was low (1L, 6.5%; 2L+, 2.8%). Most AEOSIs occurred within 150\u2009days after initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy. At 1-year follow-up, the objective response rate was 39.2% (1L, 51.5%; 2L+, 30.0%). In conclusion, the 1-year safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with unresectable advanced/recurrent NSCLC as 1L treatment for tumors with PD-L1 TPS\u2009\u2265\u200950% and 2L+ treatment for tumors with PD-L1 TPS\u2009\u2265\u20091% were similar to those reported in phase 2/3 trials.",

    "abstract": "In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10%-40% will eventually develop brain metastases. We present the clinicopathologic, genomic, and biomarker landscape of a large cohort of NSCLC brain metastases (NSCLC-BM) samples. We retrospectively analyzed 3035 NSCLC-BM tested with comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) during routine clinical care. In addition, we compared the NSCLC-BM to a separate cohort of 7277 primary NSCLC (pNSCLC) specimens. Finally, we present data on 67 paired patients with NSCLC-BM and pNSCLC. Comprehensive genomic profiling analysis of the 3035 NSCLC-BMs found that the most frequent genomic alterations (GAs) were in the TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, STK11, CDKN2B, EGFR, NKX2-1, RB1, MYC, and KEAP1 genes. In the NSCLC-BM cohort, there were significantly higher rates of several targetable GAs compared with pNSCLC, including ALK fusions, KRAS G12C mutations, and MET amplifications; and decreased frequency of MET exon14 skipping mutations (all P < .05). In the subset of NSCLC-BM (n = 1063) where concurrent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed, 54.7% of the patients with NSCLC-BM were eligible for pembrolizumab based on PD-L1 IHC (TPS \u2265 1), and 56.9% were eligible for pembrolizumab based on TMB-High status. In addition, in a series 67 paired pNSCLC and NSCLC-BM samples, 85.1% (57/67) had at least one additional GA discovered in the NSCLC-BM sample when compared with the pNSCLC sample. Herein, we defined the clinicopathologic, genomic, and biomarker landscape of a large cohort of patients with NSCLC-BM which can help inform study design of future clinical studies for patients with NSCLC with BM. In certain clinical situations, metastatic NSCLC brain tissue or cerebral spinal fluid specimens may be needed to fully optimize personalized treatment.",

    "abstract": "Approximately a third of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with surgically resectable disease. Patients who undergo surgical resection are at a high risk of relapse, and neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy improves disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The outcomes with neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are similar, and both are used in clinical practice. Recent trials investigated the role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in patients with early-stage disease. A phase III trial of adjuvant atezolizumab compared with standard of care (SOC) in patients with resected stage II or III disease and PD-L1 expression of 1% or greater, and a second trial of adjuvant pembrolizumab compared with placebo in patients with stage IB-III (regardless of tumor proportion score PD-L1 expression), both demonstrated an improvement in DFS. In the neoadjuvant setting, results of a phase III trial of chemotherapy and nivolumab compared with chemotherapy alone revealed an improvement in pathological complete response rate and event-free survival in patients with stage IB-IIIA disease. Finally, for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC, a phase III trial of osimertinib compared with SOC revealed an improvement in DFS. The results of these and ongoing trials illustrate the integration of immunotherapy and targeted therapies into the treatment paradigm of patients with surgically resected NSCLC and have led to FDA and EMA approvals in selected populations. Neoadjuvant trials have investigated novel endpoints such as major and complete pathological response, which have the potential to serve as surrogate endpoints for future trials.",

    "abstract": "A 52-year-old male was diagnosed with cT4N3M1b, cStage \u2163 adenocarcinoma of the lung, and underwent 6 courses of pemetrexed(PEM), carboplatin(CBDCA), and bevacizumab(Bev)therapy, followed by 4 courses of PEM/Bev maintenance therapy. Due to the deterioration of his condition, 4 courses of pembrolizumab(Pembro)therapy were administered as second- line therapy, but the treatment was discontinued due to disease progression. Third-line therapy with docetaxel(DTX)/ ramucirumab(Rmab)was administered, resulting in a partial response, but discontinued due to adverse events. Finally, fourth-line therapy with atezolizumab(Atezo)was initiated. After 6 courses of Atezo therapy, partial response was achieved, and the tumor continued to shrink for 3 years. The aim of the treatment strategy for both PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody drugs is to suppress T-cell exhaustion, and if either drug fails, the other drug may theoretically fail. However, in this case, the PD-L1 antibody drug was effective against non-small cell lung cancer that had shown resistance to PD-1 antibody drugs, suggesting that even if a patient becomes resistant to PD-1 antibody drugs, PD-L1 antibody drugs may result in effective outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate PD-L1 testing for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) maximizes the benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) drugs like pembrolizumab. False negative test results deny ICI treatments to eligible patients, worsening clinical and economic outcomes, while false positives increase costs by using ICI treatments without their benefits. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of PD-L1 testing with an in\u00a0vitro diagnostic (IVD) compared to a laboratory-developed test (LDT) for allocating patients with NSCLC to treatment with either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy using the German healthcare system as a model. We developed a decision analytical model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PD-L1 testing with a regulatory body approved IVD compared to an LDT from the national German healthcare payer (statutory health insurance system) perspective. Accuracy of PD-L1 testing was based on data from two independent proficiency testing programs. The 1-year model was based on outcomes data from the KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial and treatment patterns reflecting current German practices. IVDs produced accurate PD-L1 testing results in 93% (752/811) of tested cases compared to 73% (492/672) with LDTs. Most misclassifications concerned false negatives, occurring in 21% of LDTs vs 7% of IVDs. Total costs of the IVD group (48,878\u00a0\u20ac) were 196\u00a0\u20ac higher than the LDT group (48,682\u00a0\u20ac). These costs incorporate testing, first- and second-line therapy, managing treatment-related grade\u00a03+ adverse events (AEs), and end-of-life costs for those who died within the year. Total effectiveness (percentage of patients successfully diagnosed and prescribed the correct therapy per German treatment guidelines) was 19 percentage points higher for the IVD group (88%) compared to the LDT group (69%). These differences in costs and effects lead to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 1057\u00a0\u20ac. Compared to LDT technology, on-label IVD use for PD-L1 testing is only slightly more costly and substantially more effective for aligning patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC with ICI therapy according to German practice guidelines. Given these findings, changes to testing and reimbursement policies may be considered to maximize patient outcomes in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the significant improvement of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab over chemotherapy for treatment-na\u00efve stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been demonstrated, but the cost-effectiveness of these regimens remains unknown. A Markov model was adapted from the US healthcare perspective to assess the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy in treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC. Pseudo-individual patient data were generated from digitized Kaplan-Meier curves. Direct medical costs and utility values were sourced from the database and literature. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed. Sensitivity analyses and budgetary impact analyses were calculated. In any and high programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression populations, with chemotherapy, atezolizumab provided ICERs of $234,990 and $130,804 per QALY, while pembrolizumab yielded ICERs of $424,797 and $140,873 per QALY. The ICER of atezolizumab vs. pembrolizumab was $56,635 and $115,511.82 in any and high PD-L1 expression population, respectively. The critical drivers of ICERs included the cost of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab. The accumulated incremental budgetary impact of atezolizumab vs. chemotherapy increased to approximately $39.1 million in high PD-L1 expression patients over 5 years. In the high PD-L1 expression population, both atezolizumab and pembrolizumab were cost-effective for stage IV NSCLC compared to chemotherapy, which is contrary to that in any PD-L1 expression population. Atezolizumab shows a higher acceptability in both populations. Treating with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has a substantial budgetary impact on the medical burden. The PD-L1 expression level has the potential to be a predictor for the economics of ICIs.",

However, its efficacy and safety for patients \u226575\u2009years have not been prospectively investigated; this was the aim of this study. This multicenter and open-label single-arm phase II study was conducted at 12 institutions. Chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with advanced NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS of \u226550% without EGFR mutations or translocation of the ALK received pembrolizumab every 3\u2009weeks.

    "abstract": "PD-1 inhibitors have become an indispensable treatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), but the potential predictive value of clinical and molecular features need to be clarified. The objective of the study was to study the potency of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with NSCLC in contexts of both clinical and molecular features, and to aid identification of patients for choice of type of PD-1 inhibitor therapy in order to acquire more accurate NSCLC treatment in immunotherapy. PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase Science Direct, the Cochrane library, and major oncology conferences were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that were published prior to December 2021. RCTs that had PD-1 inhibitor alone or in combination with chemotherapy with non-PD-1 inhibitor for the treatment of NSCLC patients were selected. Two authors independently selected studies, data extraction and bias risk assessment. Basic characteristics of included studies, and also the 95% confidence interval and hazard ratios of the overall patients and subgroups were recorded. The inverse variance weighted method was used to estimate pooled treatment data. A total of eleven RCTs including 5,887 patients were involved. PD-1 inhibitors-based therapy substantially enhanced OS compared with non-PD-1 inhibitor therapy in patients with age group <65 years, 65-74 years, active or previous smokers, without brain metastases, liver metastases, EGFR wild-type patients, individuals in East Asia and U.S./Canada, but not in patients with age group \u226575 years, never smokers, brain metastases, EGFR mutant patients or individuals in Europe. OS was improved in patients with NSCLC who received PD-1 inhibitors regardless of their gender (male or female), histomorphological subtypes (squamous or non-squamous NSCLC), performance status (0 or 1), and PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) (<1%, \u22651%, 1-49%, or \u226550%). An analysis of subgroups revealed that, patients with age group <65 years old, male, non squamous cell carcinoma, PS 1, TPS \u22651%, and TPS \u226550% benefited from pembrolizumab treatment not related with treatment line and treatment regimen. Age group, smoking history, metastasis status/site, EGFR mutation status, and region can be used to predict the potency of PD-1 inhibitors, and to be individualized to choose different types of PD-1 inhibitors, and treatment regimen for NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for advanced wild-type non-small cell lung cancer, but there is no direct comparison to confirm which first-line treatment may lead to the longest overall survival. What qualifies as long-term survival (LS) is even unclear. By searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2005 to December 2020, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of first-line ICI-containing treatments to perform an integrated analysis (IA) to determine the criterion of LS and then screened regimens with LS for network meta-analysis (NMA). The main outcomes for NMA were median overall survival (mOS), 1-year survival rate (1ySR), and 2-year survival rate (2ySR); those for IA were the pooled mOS (POS), 1ySR (P1SR), and 2ySR (P2SR). By IA of 16 first-line ICIs from 20 RCTs, the POS was 16.20 (95% CI 14.79-17.60) months, with P1SR of 63% (95% CI 59-66%) and P2SR of 37% (33-41%). Thus, we defined LS as mOS \u2265 POS (16.20\u00a0m) for regimens and screened for RCTs with outcomes meeting this criterion. Eleven ICI-based regimens can bring LS for the overall population, among which ICI with bevacizumab and chemotherapy achieved the longest POS of 19.50\u00a0m (16.90-22.10 m) and the highest P1SR (74%, 61%-87%) and P2SR (49%, 38%-61%). Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy ranked first in mOS and 1ySR, while atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy ranked first in 2ySR. Through the IA of first-line treatment regimens, a POS of 16.20\u00a0m can be determined as the LS standard. Further considering 1ySR and 2ySR, atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy are likely to bring the longest LS in the overall population, while single ICI may be adequate for patients with a high PD-L1 expression. ICIs with bevacizumab and chemotherapy may be the best combination for LS for its further advantage over time.",

    "abstract": "Despite high expression of PD-L1, around half of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will not experience tumor response with pembrolizumab. There is an need for a better understanding of the resistance mechanisms in this setting. This bi-centric retrospective study included all consecutive patients with PDL1\u2009\u2265\u200950% advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab in first-line treatment between 2016 and 2020. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with early progression (refractory) vs others. We performed a comprehensive gene expression profile screening by RNAseq capture on tumor samples. We included 46 patients. Twenty-two patients were refractory to pembrolizumab, mainly women, with poor performance status and lower albumin concentration. RNAseq analysis was performed on 19 samples. Hierarchical clustering allowed the identification of 3 clusters with various proportion of refractory tumors: intermediate (C1: 57%), high (C2: 71%) and low proportion (C3: 40%). Comparative analysis between C2 and C3 allowed the identification of overexpressed (n\u2009=\u2009137) and underexpressed (n\u2009=\u200940) genes. Among the genes of interest, C2 exhibits higher activation of pathways associated with stemness phenotype (Hedgehog, Notch and Hippo pathways) and pathways associated with loss of PTEN and JAK2. In C2, genes associated with PD-1, toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and interferon-\u03b3 pathways were underexpressed. This study gives an overview of activated and downregulated pathways in high PD-L1 NSCLC refractory to pembrolizumab. These tumors showed activation of pathways associated with cancer stem cells, loss of PTEN and JAK2, and inhibition of both priming and effector phases of the immune response.",

    "abstract": "The PD-L1 assessment is mandatory for the selection of patients affected by advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who can benefit from the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors therapy. Previous studies tested PD-L1 on cytological smears to evaluate this sample as an alternative to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) ones, but several critical issues needed to be clarified. We evaluated the cyto-histological agreement (CHA) and the PD-L1 interobserver agreement (IrOA) among three different pathologists (Path1, Path2, Path3) on 160 paired cytological smears and histological samples of advanced NSCLC. With the cut-off of <\u00a050%/\u2265\u00a050%, CHA resulted good for Path1 (Cohen's k: 0.702) and Path3 (Cohen's k: 0.731), moderate for Path2 (Cohen's k: 0.576) adopting the same cut-off, the IrOA was moderate (ICC 0.72 [95% CI: 0.63-0.78]) for smears and good for histological samples (ICC 0.85 [95% CI: 0.80-0.85]). With a cut-off system of <\u00a050%/\u2265\u00a050%, PD-L1 assessment shows moderate to good CHA and exhibited moderate IrOA on smears and good IrOA on FFPE. As result, PD-L1 assessment should be improved on cytological smears as well as could be a suitable alternative for patients without FFPE samples and not eligible for pembrolizumab, adopting a cut-off of <\u00a050%/\u2265\u00a050%; presumably, an appropriate pathologist training could further improve the reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Frontline immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)-based regimens in non-oncogene-addicted non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been deeply investigated. To rank the available therapeutic options, we carried out a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis. A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ICI regimens, and a pairwise and a network meta-analysis (NMA) with an all-comers and a stratified strategy were conducted. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Nineteen RCTs involving 17 treatment regimens were included. For the all-comers population, pembrolizumab/chemotherapy (CT) and cemiplimab were most likely the best treatments. For programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% nivolumab/ipilimumab with/without CT, for PD-L1 >1% and 1%-49% pembrolizumab/CT and for PD-L1 >50% cemiplimab ranked first for OS. In non-squamous (NSQ), pembrolizumab with/without CT ranked first for OS; cemiplimab ranked worse than the unselected population. In squamous (SQ), pooled hazard ratio (HR) showed a better chance in improving efficacy for combination strategy, while monotherapy did not, except for cemiplimab that ranked second. Atezolizumab/CT/bevacizumab ranked first in most subgroups for PFS. Direct comparison showed a non-statistically significant benefit of ICI regimens for the liver metastases cohort in OS, with a good ranking for pembrolizumab/CT and atezolizumab/bevacizumab/CT. Regarding brain metastases, all ICI regimens demonstrated an improvement in OS and PFS compared to CT. Nivolumab/ipilimumab/CT ranked better in this subset. Our meta-analysis updated on the most recent findings demonstrates that different ICI treatments rank differently in specific NSCLC settings (histology, biomarker and clinical presentation) offering a novel challenging scenario for clinical decision making and research planning.",

    "abstract": "Availability of checkpoint inhibitors has created a paradigm shift in the management of patients with solid tumors. Despite this, most patients do not respond to immunotherapy, and there is considerable interest in developing combination therapies to improve response rates and outcomes. B7-H3 (CD276) is a member of the B7 family of cell surface molecules and provides an alternative immune checkpoint molecule to therapeutically target alone or in combination with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-targeted therapies. Enoblituzumab, an investigational anti-B7-H3 humanized monoclonal antibody, incorporates an immunoglobulin G1 fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain that enhances Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Coordinated engagement of innate and adaptive immunity by targeting distinct members of the B7 family (B7-H3 and PD-1) is hypothesized to provide greater antitumor activity than either agent alone. In this phase I/II study, patients received intravenous enoblituzumab (3-15 mg/kg) weekly plus intravenous pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) every 3 weeks during dose-escalation and cohort expansion. Expansion cohorts included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; checkpoint inhibitor [CPI]-na\u00efve and post-CPI, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] <1%), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; CPI-na\u00efve), urothelial cancer (post-CPI), and melanoma (post-CPI). Disease was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 after 6 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter. Safety and pharmacokinetic data were provided for all enrolled patients; efficacy data focused on HNSCC and NSCLC cohorts. Overall, 133 patients were enrolled and received \u22651 dose of study treatment. The maximum tolerated dose of enoblituzumab with pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg was not reached. Intravenous enoblituzumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks plus pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) every 3 weeks was recommended for phase II evaluation. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 116 patients (87.2%) and were grade \u22653 in 28.6%. One treatment-related death occurred (pneumonitis). Objective responses occurred in 6 of 18 (33.3% [95% CI 13.3 to 59.0]) patients with CPI-na\u00efve HNSCC and in 5 of 14 (35.7% [95% CI 12.8 to 64.9]) patients with CPI-na\u00efve NSCLC. Checkpoint targeting with enoblituzumab and pembrolizumab demonstrated acceptable safety and antitumor activity in patients with CPI-na\u00efve HNSCC and NSCLC. NCT02475213.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) have been rapidly adopted in US clinical practice for first-line therapy of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since regulatory approval in October 2016, and a better understanding is needed of long-term outcomes of ICI therapy administered in real-world settings outside of clinical trials. Our aim was to describe long-term outcomes of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy at US oncology practices for patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 expression \u226550%, and good performance status. This retrospective two-cohort study used technology-enabled abstraction of deidentified electronic health records (EHR cohort) plus enhanced manual chart review (spotlight cohort) to study adult patients with stage IV NSCLC, PD-L1 expression \u226550%, no documented  The EHR cohort included 566 patients (298 [53%] men); the spotlight cohort included 228 (105 [46%] men); median age in both cohorts was 71. Median follow-up from pembrolizumab initiation to data cutoff was 35.1 months (range, 12.0-52.7) and 38.4 months (range, 33.1-44.9) in EHR and spotlight cohorts, respectively. Median OS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 16.6-24.3) and 21.1 months (95% CI, 16.2-28.9), respectively; 3-year OS rates were 36.2% and 38.2% in EHR and spotlight cohorts, respectively.

For 151/228 patients (66%) who discontinued pembrolizumab, the most common reasons were disease progression (70 [46%]) and therapy-related adverse effects (35 [23%]). Real-world outcomes remain consistent with outcomes observed in clinical trials, supporting long-term benefits of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 expression \u226550%, and good performance status.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have prolonged the survival of patients with various carcinomas, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and have caused a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. Although programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells is a predictive marker of therapeutic efficacy, additional predictive markers are required. This study aimed to explore the role of immunological and nutritional parameters in the prediction of treatment response. Patients diagnosed with NSCLC and treated with pembrolizumab were examined retrospectively. Body weight was measured 4-6\u00a0weeks before the start of the first treatment, immediately before treatment, and 4-6\u00a0weeks after the start of the first treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start of pembrolizumab treatment to the last follow-up date or until disease progression. Statistical analyses were performed to confirm the association between various factors and association between these factors and PFS. Thirty-eight patients with advanced NSCLC were included. We observed a significant association of weight loss and PD-L1 expression with PFS in the multivariate analysis. A significant correlation was found between the advanced lung cancer inflammation index and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. A weight loss of\u2009>\u20095% after the start of treatment was significantly associated with worse PFS. Weight loss is an important negative prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC receiving immunotherapy. Weight maintenance may be important for good ICI treatment efficacy, and future interventions in cancer cachexia are expected to further enhance the treatment efficacy of ICIs.",

    "abstract": "Bronchoalveolar lavage is commonly performed to assess inflammation and identify responsible pathogens in lung diseases. Findings from bronchoalveolar lavage might be used to evaluate the immune profile of the lung tumor microenvironment (TME). To investigate whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis can help identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), BALF and blood were prospectively collected before initiating nivolumab. The secreted molecules, microbiome, and cellular profiles based on BALF and blood analysis of 12 patients were compared with regard to therapeutic effect. Compared with ICI nonresponders, responders showed significantly higher CXCL9 levels and a greater diversity of the lung microbiome profile in BALF, along with a greater frequency of the CD56+ subset in blood T cells, whereas no significant difference in PD-L1 expression was found in tumor cells. Antibiotic treatment in a preclinical lung cancer model significantly decreased CXCL9 in the lung TME, resulting in reduced sensitivity to anti-PD-1 antibody, which was reversed by CXCL9 induction in tumor cells. Thus, CXCL9 might be associated with the lung TME microbiome, and the balance of CXCL9 and lung TME microbiome could contribute to nivolumab sensitivity in patients with NSCLC. BALF analysis can help predict the efficacy of ICIs when performed along with currently approved examinations.",

We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of 300 patients with NSCLC exhibiting high PD-L1 expression who received MONO or COMB as first-line treatment between December 2018 and January 2020. We reviewed the medical records of all consecutive patients with no driver mutations, and assessed the patient characteristics, therapeutic regimens, treatment periods, and adverse events. In total, 166 (55%; median age: 74\u00a0years) and 134 (45%; median age: 68\u00a0years) patients received MONO and COMB, respectively. Patients were younger and had better performance status (0-1) in the COMB group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). With a median follow-up time of 10.6 (range: 0.1-20.6) months, the median progression-free survival was 7.1\u00a0months with MONO and 13.1\u00a0months with COMB. The objective response rate was 42.2% with MONO and 67.9% with COMB. With respect to treatment discontinuation, 36 out of 166 (21.7%) and 28 out of 134 (20.1%) patients discontinued MONO and COMB, respectively. In conclusion, COMB may be a promising option for first-line treatment for NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression and good performance status.",

    "abstract": "We recently conducted Cetuximab-AVElumab-Lung (CAVE-Lung), a proof-of-concept, translational and clinical trial, to evaluate the combination of two IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb): avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 drug, and cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drug, as second- or third-line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We have reported clinically relevant anti-tumor activity in 6/16 patients. Clinical benefit was accompanied by Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Among the 6 responding patients, 3 had progressed after initial response to a previous treatment with single agent anti-PD-1, nivolumab or pembrolizumab. We report long-term clinical follow-up and additional findings on the anti-tumor activity and on the immune effects of cetuximab plus avelumab treatment for these 3 patients. As of November 30, 2021, 2/3 patients were alive. One patient was still on treatment from 34\u2009months, while the other two patients had progression free survival (PFS) of 15 and 19\u2009months, respectively. Analysis of serially collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) revealed long-term activation of NK cell-mediated ADCC. Comprehensive genomic profile analysis found somatic mutations and germline rare variants in DNA damage response (DDR) genes. Furthermore, by transcriptomic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset we found that DDR mutant NSCLC displayed high STING pathway gene expression. In NSCLC patient-derived three-dimensional in vitro spheroid cultures, cetuximab plus avelumab treatment induced additive cancer cell growth inhibition as compared to single agent treatment. This effect was partially blocked by treatment with an anti-CD16 mAb, suggesting a direct involvement of NK cell activation. Furthermore, cetuximab plus avelumab treatment induced 10-, 20-, and 20-fold increase, respectively, in the gene expression of CCL5 and CXCL10, two STING downstream effector cytokines, and of interferon \u03b2, as compared to untreated control samples. DDR mutations may contribute to DDR-induced STING pathway with sustained innate immunity activation following cetuximab plus avelumab combination in previously treated, PD-1 inhibitor responsive NSCLC patients.",

Peripheral blood biomarkers, such as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and the ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count (ANC/ALC), have been shown to be immune-inflammatory parameters highlighting an individual's immune status. The prognostic role of ALC and ANC/ALC on overall survival (OS) was examined in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) receiving pembrolizumab. Of a total of 239 patients, 52% were male, with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59-73). Most patients had a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (76%), with stage IV disease (82%). PD-L1 expression was >50% in 44% of the patients. The median time on treatment with pembrolizumab was 5.8 months (IQR, 2.9-12.7). An ANC/ALC <5 was associated with improved OS at initiation of pembrolizumab (P = .002), whereas an ALC >1.4 deciliter (dL) trended toward improved OS compared with ALC <1.4 dL (P = .053). After adjusting for potential cofounders with a multivariate analysis, a baseline ANC/ALC of 5 or higher was associated with a significantly increased risk of death (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.27-2.93; P = .002). An ANC/ALC <5 at the time of initiation of treatment with pembrolizumab was associated with improved OS in patients with advanced NSCLC.

However, no randomized control trials comparing neoadjuvant immunotherapy with chemoimmunotherapy have yet been reported. This study aimed to summarize and compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC. Literature focusing on the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC published before June 2021 was retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Study endpoints included major pathological response (MPR), complete pathological response (pCR), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), severe adverse events (SAEs), resection rate, surgical delay rate, and conversion to thoracotomy. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were further performed. A total of 988 patients from 16 studies were included in this meta-analysis. For patients who received neoadjuvant immunotherapy with single/combined ICIs or chemoimmunotherapy, the pooled MPR rate was 43.5% and the pooled pCR rate was 21.9%. The pooled incidence of TRAEs and SAEs were 54.8% and 15.3%, respectively. The pooled resection rate was 85.8%, the surgical delay rate was 7.4%, and the conversion rate was 17.4%. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy had remarkably improved pathological response (MPR rate: 53.3%  Overall, neoadjuvant immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy is effective and safe in NSCLC. Compared with single-agent immunotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy provides a significant improvement in pathological response without increasing the incidence of SAEs or surgical delay. These results need further confirmation by more large-scale randomized controlled trials.",

    "abstract": "The important developments achieved in recent years with a consequent paradigm shift in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including the latest immune checkpoint inhibitors, have led to an increasing need to optimize the scarce material usually available in the diagnosis of these tumors. In this sense, this study intends to evaluate the performance of double immunohistochemistry (IHC) in comparison to simple IHC for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) evaluation with 22C3 clone for selection to therapy with pembrolizumab. For that, 38 histologic samples of NSCLC small biopsies sent to our laboratory were selected. Double IHC were performed with the doublets TTF1/PD-L1 and p40/PD-L1, after all the usual diagnostic routine and molecular study was performed. The slides were interpreted by 2 independent pathologists and the results obtained were compared with each other and with the results obtained at diagnosis. A perfect agreement was observed when comparing the immunoexpression of TTF1 and p40 in double IHC in relation to single IHC. Although the agreement was substantial in the analysis of the positive/negative PD-L1 IHC (81.6% to 92.1%; \u03ba=0.610 to 0.829) and in the analysis of the 50% cut-off (86.8% to 89.5%; \u03ba=0.704 to 0.759), it fell short of the expected and desirable agreement for a biomarker such as PD-L1, since this result will have a major role in the institution of a treatment. In conclusion, this small series does not allow us to recommend this methodology for the evaluation of the PD-L1 biomarker in double staining IHC with the 22C3 clone for therapy selection.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was traditionally associated with a poor prognosis. Between 2010 and 2016, the 5-years overall survival for all stages combined was about 25 percent. However, the recent use of immunotherapy has led to significant improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Immune check point inhibitors enable the host immune system to mount a lethal response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemipilimab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) have been approved by the FDA for use in NSCLC, either as individual agents or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other agents. As the future of immunotherapy for lung cancer continues to evolve, with multiple agents approved or in various stages of clinical research, it is imperative that we understand the mechanism of action, clinical activity, ongoing clinical trials, indications for use and toxicity for individual agents in addition to having general, basic knowledge about this new class of cancer therapeutics. In this review, we focus on two of the newer PD-L1 inhibitors, durvalumab and avelumab.",

However, whether pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is still a better choice for first-line treatment in elderly patients (\u226575 years old) remain unknown. We retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety of these two treatments in elderly patients. We collected data of 136 elderly patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy monotherapy in our hospital from 2018 to 2020. We compared the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients and analyzed which subgroups might benefit more significantly from pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. In total population, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy showed superior PFS and OS than chemotherapy monotherapy (PFS: 12.50 months vs. 5.30 months, P<0.001; OS: unreached vs. 21.27 months, P=0.037). Subgroup analysis showed patients with positive PD-L1 expression, stage IV, good performance score (ECOG-PS <2), fewer comorbidities (simplified comorbidity score <9) or female patients had demonstrated a more evident OS benefit in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. In terms of safety, the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group had higher treatment discontinuation (26% vs. 5%). Elderly patients using pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy achieved longer PFS and OS, but were more likely to discontinue due to adverse effects, so disease stage, PD-L1 expression, ECOG-PS and comorbidities should be considered when selecting first-line treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is widely used in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with positive programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, efficacy evaluation along treatment by serial monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing remained to be well studied. Nine PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC patients were prospectively enrolled and received pembrolizumab monotherapy. Pretreatment tissue and/or plasma samples were collected as baseline reference. Serial plasma samples were collected after 3 and 6\u2009weeks of treatment as well as at disease progression. All samples underwent targeted next-generation sequencing. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) were 4.43 and 25.53\u2009months, respectively. In total, 3 patients achieved partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for more than 6\u2009months and were thus classified into the durable clinical benefit (DCB) group, whereas the rest 6 were grouped as nondurable benefit (NDB) patients. Molecular profiling of baseline samples revealed that  Genomic profiling of peripheral blood samples can be applied to dynamically monitor disease progression. The reduction in ctDNA concentration during treatment implied DCBs.",

Here we report efficacy and safety results for the Asian subpopulation. Patients with stage IV/recurrent NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy (PD-L1 \u22651%) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy (PD-L1 <1%).

In the Asian subpopulation with PD-L1 \u22651%, 81 patients received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 81 received chemotherapy. Median OS was not reached with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 24.8 months with chemotherapy; 3-year OS rate was 53% versus 37% [hazard ratio (HR), 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.11].

The two most common targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) were not expressed. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was expressed in <50% of the tumor cells. In 2016, initial guideline-concordant treatment with carboplatin/vinorelbine chemotherapy was initiated. Between the first two cycles, all positron emission tomography (PET) positive lesions were irradiated with 30 Gy in 10 fractions (lung, nodes, thoracic spinal manifestation). After nine months with excellent response (at least partial remission, possibly fibrosis only), bilateral lung metastases were diagnosed. The patient was started on nivolumab monotherapy (later atezolizumab due to a change in National practice) and completed two years of treatment. She is currently in continued complete remission with regular follow-up examinations. This case illustrates that outcomes comparable to those observed in patients with limited brain metastases may be observed in patients with localized intraspinal disease and that immune checkpoint inhibitors play an important role in the management of metastatic NSCLC.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably monoclonal antibodies directed against programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), have transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the reference first-line therapy, and numerous phase III trials have established their efficacy in treatment-na\u00efve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was validated for patients with\u2009\u2265\u00a050% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 and, in the USA, for patients with \u2265\u00a01% PD-L1 positivity. More recently, cemiplimab as monotherapy was also validated for patients whose tumors expressed \u2265\u00a050% PD-L1. Several ICIs (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, and recently durvalumab) in combination with chemotherapy achieved overall survival gains among \"all comers\", compared with chemotherapy alone. The results were more contrasting for paired immunotherapies combining anti-PD-L1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 agents, with the benefit/risk balance not yet fully established. Recently, nivolumab-ipilimumab and two chemotherapy cycles limited patient exposure to chemotherapy and obtained positive results compared with the latter alone. However, those phase III trials included selected patients in good general condition and without active brain metastases. Little is known about immunotherapy and combination immunotherapy-chemotherapy efficacies in never-smokers or patients with tumors harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. In this review, we report our analysis of the main results available on first-line ICI use, as monotherapy or combined or in combination with chemotherapy, to treat metastatic NSCLCs in general and also for specific populations: the elderly, never-smokers, patients with brain metastases, and those with an EGFR mutation or ALK translocation.",

Within this group of drugs, those aimed at the programmed cell death-1 or programmed cell death ligand-1(PD1/PDL-1) are very relevant, for example, Pembrolizumab. Although its adverse reactions are generally mild and well tolerated, it has been associated with certain immune-related adverse events (IrAEs) than can be serious and affect any organ. A 62-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with a single bone metastasis and PD-L1 expression of 60% started treatment with cisplatin-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab, and maintenance with pembrolizumab. The patient attended the ER with pericardial effusion that was assumed to be a Pembrolizumab IrAE and was managed with corticosteroids. The patient fully recovered but immunotherapy was not reintroduced due to the severity of the AE. The cardiovascular system is among the least affected organs by immunotoxicity, with an incidence between 0.09-0.6%. However, some authors suspect the incidence is underestimated. Median time to onset is highly variable, ranging from 6 weeks since the first dose to 2 years after discontinuation of the treatment. There are not guidelines on the most effective management of the IrAEs, but according to the pharmaceutical reference, corticosteroids should be initiated followed by a progressive reduction. If no response is obtained, another immunosuppressive agent should be added. The determination to restart immunotherapy depends on the severity of the adverse reaction, the availability of other alternative treatments, and the cancer response.",

Whether routine biomarker testing and access to personalized therapies are limited in some Italian regions is unclear. We conducted a national cross-sectional survey between April and June 2019 among Italian oncologists to determine differences in biomarker testing and access to personalized therapies for lung cancer. Based on GIMBE report n. 3/2018, 32 respondents (37.6%) were defined as belonging to budget deficit regions (BDRs) while 53 (62.4%) were from balanced/positive budget regions (BPRs).

Approvals of these anti-PD-L1 agents were supported by statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS) in international, multicenter, active-controlled randomized trials. In KEYNOTE-024, the OS HR was 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41-0.89; P = 0.005] favoring pembrolizumab over platinum-doublet chemotherapy. In IMpower110, the OS HR was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.40-0.89; P = 0.0106) favoring atezolizumab over platinum-doublet chemotherapy. In Study 1624, the OS HR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.87; P = 0.0022) favoring cemiplimab-rwlc over platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The progression-free survival (PFS) effect sizes for these anti-PD-L1 antibodies were also comparable across their respective registrational trials, and their safety profiles were consistent with the anti-PD-L1 class adverse event profile. The consistent survival benefits and manageable toxicity profiles of these single-agent anti-PD-L1 antibodies have established them as important treatment options in the PD-L1-high NSCLC treatment landscape.

    "abstract": "Although programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have shown survival benefits in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most patients progress. This study evaluated whether continuing pembrolizumab with additional chemotherapy after failure of prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor extends survival. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized phase II study enrolled patients with NSCLC who received one or two cytotoxic chemotherapy, including at least one platinum-doublet regimen, and progressed on second- or third-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy as the last systemic therapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to pembrolizumab or placebo plus chemotherapy, stratified by histology and clinical outcomes to prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 98 patients were randomized to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy (N = 47) and placebo-chemotherapy arm (N = 51). At the median follow-up duration of 10.5 months, there was no statistical difference in PFS [median 4.1 months vs. 5.9 months; HR = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-1.62; P = 0.78) and overall survival (median 11.5 months vs. 12.0 months; HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.66-1.83; P = 0.73) between the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and placebo-chemotherapy arms. In a subgroup with PD-L1 expression in \u226550% of tumor cells and favorable clinical outcomes to prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (partial response or 6 months or longer of stable disease), the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy arm showed a higher 24-month survival rate than the placebo-chemotherapy arm (74% vs. 38%; HR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.13-2.1; P = 0.34).

Durvalumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) / programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis, demonstrated efficacy as maintenance therapy after definitive chemoradiation. However, the role of immunotherapy in those who cannot tolerate chemoradiation is unclear. This retrospective case series reports adult patients with PD-L1-expressing stage III NSCLC diagnosed at Parkview Cancer Institute from 2019-2021 and treated initially with pembrolizumab followed by sequential consolidation chest radiation (CXRT) without cytotoxic chemotherapy. Four cases of stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma were disease-controlled by this approach, with two partial and one complete response. One case of stage IIIC adenocarcinoma had progressive disease with brain metastasis prior to CXRT. This case series suggests that pembrolizumab with sequential CXRT may be beneficial for stage III NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression, but additional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this retrospective, observational, noninterventional cohort study was to investigate prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) and to develop a novel prognostic model. A total of 4049 patients with aNSCLC diagnosed between January 2011 and February 2020 who received atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab as second-line monotherapy were selected from a real-world deidentified database to build the cohort. Patients could not have received first-line treatment with clinical study drug(s) nor immune checkpoint inhibitors including anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapies. Patients had a median age of 69\u2009years; 45% were female, 75% White, 70% had stage IV at initial diagnosis, and 70% had nonsquamous histology. A Cox proportional hazards model with lasso regularization was used to build a prognostic model for OS using 18 baseline demographic and clinical factors based on the real-world data cohort. The risk-increasing prognostic factors were abnormally low albumin and chloride levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score\u2009\u2265\u20092, and abnormally high levels of alkaline phosphatase and white blood cells. The risk-decreasing prognostic factors were PD-L1 positivity, longer time from advanced diagnosis to start of first-line therapy, and higher systolic blood pressure. The performance of the model was validated using data from the OAK trial, and the c-index for the OAK trial validation cohort was 0.65 and 0.67 for the real-world data cohort. Based on baseline demographic and clinical factors from a real-world setting, this prognostic model was developed to discriminate the risk of death in patients with aNSCLC treated with checkpoint inhibitors as second-line monotherapy, and it performed well in the real-world data and clinical trial cohorts.",

However, it is undeniable that only a small proportion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations can achieve long-term responses and benefit from immunotherapy. Herein, we report the case of a 48-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with an EGFR L858R mutation who was administered pembrolizumab monotherapy followed by pemetrexed and achieved a 10-month progression-free survival interval. In this case report, we show that ICIs were effective for our patient with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and discuss the characteristics of patients who can benefit from immunotherapy. We suggest that patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression (defined as \u2265 25%), the L858R mutation, smoking history, or pemetrexed pretreatment may benefit from immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis is usually ineffective in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), either as first-line treatment or in later lines. By contrast, especially for patients with common EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion/L858R point mutation), an orally bioavailable EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is the best upfront therapy, being able to provide response rates well above 50% and a median progression-free survival ranging from 11 to 19\u00a0months, depending on whether a second-generation (e.g., afatinib) or a third-generation (i.e., osimertinib) EGFR-TKI is used. Unfortunately, treatment options for these patients at the time of acquired resistance are limited. As for afatinib-pretreated patients, those who develop a T790M mutation may benefit from osimertinib, whereas platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferable therapeutic strategy for T790M-negative patients as well as for patients who progress on osimertinib administered as first-line therapy. Here, we describe the case of an exon-19-deleted patient who experienced a complete response to the anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab upon the development of T790M-negative acquired resistance to afatinib. Furthermore, we discuss this case in the context of the existing literature, especially focusing on the importance of evaluating multiple markers of immune response post-EGFR-TKI and prior to ICI treatment in order to select the best treatment strategy in this clinical scenario.",

Overall survival (OS, months [mo]) was assessed in correlation with blood biomarkers (BB: NLR, dNLR, PLR, SII, LIPI, ALI); a predictive score was developed. In the propensity score matching analysis (n\u00a0=\u00a0236; 118 patients in each group matched for age, sex and ECOG PS), mOS was 17.2mo (95% CI, 13.2-36.5) and 21.3mo (95% CI, 14.8-NR) in groups P and PCT, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a0.44). In group P, NLR, dNLR, PLR, LIPI, and ALI significantly correlated with OS in uni- and multivariate COX regression analyses (P < .05), whereas in group PCT, none of the BB demonstrated a significant correlation. A predictive score was developed (each parameter receiving one point): age\u226565, female sex, never-smoking status, adenocarcinoma histology, dNLR\u22653.

    "abstract": "High PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is evident to predict elevated immunotherapy efficacy, to which NSCLC with onco-driver gene mutations is probed with poor responsiveness. Thus, it is of great interest to investigate how effective immune monotherapy is in the presence of concurrent high PD-L1 expression and driving gene mutation. We present a case of squamous lung cancer with high PD-L1 expression and HER2 exon 20 insertion (20Ins) who presented hyperprogressive disease (HPD) after being treated with PD-1 inhibitor. A 71-year-old female was diagnosed with advanced squamous lung cancer with 98% tumor proportion score of PD-1 and 20ins. She benefited from first-line docetaxel cisplatin followed by 2 months second-line afatinib. Third-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was then given. Unfortunately, she rapidly progressed with dramatically enlarged primary site as well as mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural effusion only 2 weeks later, presenting severe dyspnea and dysphagia. Re-biopsy was conducted, and we found that compared with the baseline, CD8+ T cells were largely recruited only in tumor stroma but not in tumor parenchyma. Tumor-associated macrophages were notably increased in both tumor stroma and parenchyma. Concomitantly, CD56dim NK cells in tumor parenchyma were decreased. Application of immune monotherapy in patients with positive driver genes demands extreme caution, even harboring high PD-L1 expression. Abnormality of tumor microenvironment might be critically involved in immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced HPD. Further study in greater depth is required.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether mRNA expressions and dynamic changes of immune-related genes before and after starting first-line treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC were of predictive value. CD3, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 mRNA expression levels were measured from peripheral blood before and after three weeks of treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed retrospectively. Response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined. In univariate analysis an increase of CD3 and CD8 mRNA expression after the first cycle of pembrolizumab were each associated with improved PFS and OS. In contrast, patients with no change or with a decrease in CD3 and CD8 mRNA expression showed significantly worse outcome. CD8 mRNA increase remained an independent predictive factor for PFS and OS in the multivariate analysis with p values of 0.011 and 0.006, respectively. An increase of CD8 mRNA expression predicts favorable outcome after first line monotherapy with pembrolizumab, while no change or decrease might serve as an indicator of poor outcome and might give cause for early treatment escalation for instance by addition of chemotherapy or additional ICI treatment, e.g., against CTLA-4.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are currently one of the most promising therapy options in the field of oncology. Although the first pivotal ICI trial results were published in\u00a02011, few biomarkers exist to predict their therapy outcome. PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were proven to be sometimes-unreliable biomarkers. We have previously suggested the analysis of processing escapes, a qualitative measurement of epitope structure alterations under immune system pressure, to provide predictive information on ICI response. Here, we sought to further validate this approach and characterize interactions with different forms of immune pressure. We identified a cohort consisting of 48 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab as ICI monotherapy. Tumor samples were subjected to targeted amplicon-based sequencing using a panel of 22 cancer-associated genes covering 98 mutational hotspots. Altered antigen processing was predicted by NetChop, and MHC binding verified by NetMHC. The NanoString nCounter\u00ae platform was utilized to provide gene expression data of 770 immune-related genes. Patient data from 408 patients with NSCLC were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as a validation cohort. The two immune escape mechanisms of PD-L1 expression (TPS score) (n\u2009=\u200918) and presence of altered antigen processing (n\u2009=\u200910) are mutually non-exclusive and can occur in the same patient (n\u2009=\u20096). Both mechanisms have exclusive influence on different genes and pathways, according to differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis, respectively. Interestingly, gene expression patterns associated with altered processing were enriched in T cell and NK cell immune activity. Though both mechanisms influence different genes, they are similarly linked to increased immune activity. Pressure from the immune system will lay the foundations for escape mechanisms, leading to acquisition of resistance under therapy. Both PD-L1 expression and altered antigen processing are induced similarly by pronounced immunoactivity but in different context. The present data help to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind those\u00a0immune escapes.",

The present study investigated this association in patients with advanced NSCLC. We retrospectively reviewed patients with advanced NSCLC who received PD-1 inhibitors at the National Cancer Center Hospital between January 2016 and December 2018. The efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors (progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS], and response rate) was compared between overweight (BMI \u226525\u00a0kg/m A total of 324 patients were included in this study and the median BMI (IQR) was 21.4 (19.5-23.6) kg/m2.

No significant differences in objective response rate (ORR), PFS, or OS were found between overweight and non-overweight patients overall (n\u00a0=\u00a0324; overweight vs. non-overweight: ORR, 28.9% vs. 31.9%, respectively [p\u00a0=\u00a00.68]; PFS, 7.6 vs. 5.8 months, respectively [p\u00a0=\u00a00.43]; and OS, 17.6 vs. 15.3 months, respectively [p\u00a0=\u00a00.90]), or between overweight and non-overweight patients in Cohorts 1 and 2. No significant differences in the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors were observed between overweight and non-overweight patients.",

Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our results. Additional price reduction and willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold scenario analyses were performed to explore the impact of economic and health policies with Chinese characteristics on our results. The PD-L1 test-based strategy costs approximately CNY 194,607 (USD 28,210) or more and yielded an additional 0.27 QALYs compared to the docetaxel strategy without a PD-L1 test, equating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CNY 731,089 (USD 105,978)/QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that the price of nivolumab was the strongest source of variation in the ICERs. Probability sensitivity analysis showed that the probability for the PD-L1 test-based strategy being cost-effective increases with the increase of WTP thresholds. From the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, using a PD-L1 test to guide second-line nivolumab treatment was not cost-effective. The National Healthcare Security Administration negotiation on the price reduction of nivolumab was found to be the most effective action to improve its cost-effectiveness in China.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and is associated with resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Several interactions between tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment are effected through integrin signaling; however the latter has been underrecognized as a pathway that could have an impact on oncological outcomes after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study aimed to assess the clinical relevance of genomic alterations in the integrin signaling pathway in ICI-treated patients with advanced cancers. Next generation sequencing (NGS) data from tumor samples of patients with advanced cancers treated with ICIs (anti-PD-1/PD-L1, anti-CTLA4 or both) were queried from four independent publicly available cohorts for mutations and structural variations in 72 integrin signaling pathway genes (Gene Set: GOBP_CELL_ADHESION_MEDIATED_BY_INTEGRIN). The Kaplan Meier method was used to assess the association between mutated and unmutated genes with overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). All results were reported at the 0.05 significance level. The largest cohort included 1662 patients (discovery set) and comprised 350 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 321 melanoma, 214 bladder, 151 renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 138 head neck (HN), 126 esophageal/gastric (EG), 117 glioma, 110 colorectal (CRC), 90 cancer of unknown primary (CUP), and 45 breast cancer patients. ICI treatments included PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (n=1256), anti-CTLA4 inhibitors (n=146) or both (n=260). 170 patients (10% of the entire cohort) harbored mutations in PIK3CG (6%), RET (3%), SYK (1.4%), LYN (1.4%), PTPN11 (1.3%), and CRKL (0.1%) genes. Presence of these mutations was more frequent in melanoma (18%), followed by CRC (14.5%), CUP (11%), and NSCLC (11%). Patients with mutated tumors experienced a significantly longer median OS (41 months) compared to those without alterations (16 months, log-rank P<0.001). The favorable prognostic value of PIK3CG, RET, SYK, LYN, PTPN11, and CRKL alterations was confirmed in three melanoma cohorts (validation set, n=212, P=0.024). Assessment of mutation status of these genes in a fourth cohort of NSCLC patients (n=75) revealed a predictive significance as well, with regard to PFS after treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab combination (P=0.048). Mutations and/or structural variations in integrin signaling genes may have prognostic and predictive value in patients with metastatic malignancies who receive ICIs. Although confirmation in larger studies with concurrent investigation of underlying immunologic mechanisms is needed, these findings pose therapeutic implications for co-targeted approaches to overcome immune evasion and resistance.",

However, differences in reactions toward PD-1/PD-L1 ICI among patients impose inefficient treatment. Therefore, developing a reliable biomarker to predict PD-1/PD-L1 ICI reaction is highly necessary for predictive, preventive, and personalized (3P) medicine. We recruited 63 patients from the National Cancer Center (NCC) and classified them into the training and validation sets. Next, 99 patients were recruited for inclusion into the external validation set at the Samsung Medical Center (SMC). Proteomic analysis enabled us to identify plasma C7 levels, which were significantly different among groups classified by their overall response to the RECIST V 1.1-based assessment. Analytical performance was evaluated to predict the PD-1/PD-L1 ICI response for each type of immunotherapy, and NSCLC histology was evaluated by determining the C7 levels via ELISA. Plasma C7 levels were significantly different between patients with and without clinical benefits (PFS \u2265 6 months). Among the groups sorted by histology and PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy type, only the predicted accuracy for pembrolizumab-treated patients from both NCC and SMC was greater than 73%. In patients treated with pembrolizumab, C7 levels were superior to those of the companion diagnostics 22C3 (70.3%) and SP263 (62.1%). Moreover, for pembrolizumab-treated patients for whom the PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) was < 50%, the predictive accuracy of C7 was nearly 20% higher than that of 22C3 and SP263. Evaluation of plasma C7 levels shows an accurate prediction of NSCLC patient reactions on pembrolizumab. It demonstrates plasma C7 is an alternative and supportive biomarker to overcome the predictive limitation of previous 22C3 and SP263. Thus, it is clear that clinical use of plasma C7 allows predictive diagnosis on lung cancer patients who have not been successfully treated with current CDx and targeted prevention on metastatic diseases in secondary care caused by a misdiagnosis of current CDx. Reduction of patients' financial burden and increased efficacy of cancer treatment would also enable prediction, prevention, and personalization of medical service on NSCLC patients. In other words, plasma C7 provides efficient medical service and an optimized medical economy followed which finally promotes the prosperity of 3P medicine.

We carried out a nationwide cohort retrospective study of consecutive patients with advanced, refractory NSCLC who received nivolumab as second to later lines of treatment as part of the expanded access program. Key objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab and the efficacy of first post-nivolumab treatment. Nine hundred and two patients were enrolled: 317 (35%) with squamous cell carcinoma and 585 (65%) with non-squamous cell carcinoma. Median age was 64 years; there were 630 (70%) men, 795 (88%) smokers, 723 (81%) patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0/1, 197 (22%) patients with brain metastases, and 212 (27%) with liver metastases. Best response was partial response for 16.2% and stable disease (SD) for 30.5%. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates at 2, 3, and 5 years were 8% and 25%, 6% and 16%, and 4% and 10%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, ECOG PS \u22652 [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0= 2.13, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.78-2.55, P < 0.001], squamous histology (HR\u00a0= 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.36, P\u00a0= 0.04), and presence of central nervous system metastases (HR\u00a0= 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54, P\u00a0= 0.005) were significantly associated with lower OS. Four hundred and ninety-two patients received at least one treatment after discontinuation of nivolumab, consisting of systemic therapies in 450 (91%). Radiation therapy was delivered to 118 (24%) patients. The CLINIVO cohort represents the largest real-world evidence cohort with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor in advanced, metastatic NSCLC after failure of first-line chemotherapy, with long-term follow-up and analysis of subsequent therapies. Our data confirm the efficacy of nivolumab in a cohort larger than that reported in landmark clinical trials and identify prognostic factors, which reinforces the need for accurate selection of patients for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our data indicate that oligoprogression is frequent after nivolumab exposure and provide a unique insight into the long-term survival.",

We report the case of a 78-year-old male with right lung mass, mediastinal, right neck, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathies. He was diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, cT4N3M1c, Stage IVB. The tumor cells showed high programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression but no microsatellite instability. After three cycles of pembrolizumab as the first-line therapy, chest computed tomography revealed marked reduction in tumor diameter. No remarkable adverse events occurred. The patient is alive with no complaints and no disease progression and has continued pembrolizumab for 8 months. Thus, first-line pembrolizumab therapy appears beneficial against pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma, at least when PD-L1 expression is high. It is also effective in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, as first-line treatment for wild-type advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We systematically searched databases, Clinical Trial.gov and included randomized clinical trials focusing on advanced NSCLC using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment. Hazard ratio for overall survival and progression-free survival, odds ratio for any-cause high-adverse events (grade 3 or higher) were documented according to Bayesian NMA. Subgroup analysis was performed according to PD-L1 level and histology. Thirteen trials including 9154 patients were included. In the PD-L1 nonselective cohort, chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, respectively, were significantly better than any other treatment strategies in both OS benefit (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.63; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.85) and PFS benefit (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.63). In subgroup analysis, pembrolizumab appeared to provide the best OS benefit (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67) as well as the best PFS benefit (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67) in the PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% cohort. In contrast, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy exhibited the best OS benefit in the PD-L1\u2009<\u200950% cohort. Furthermore, OS benefit from pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was more obvious in nonsquamous patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.56). Additionally, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was associated with fewer adverse events than other chemotherapy combination strategies. In the first-line treatment, chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab or atezolizumab could enhance efficacy compared with chemotherapy alone or other PD-1/L1-based treatment strategies, especially in the nonsquamous population. Furthermore, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy guarantees reliable security simultaneously, which may be the optimal treatment strategy for patients with major advanced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality in China and worldwide. In China, lung cancer accounts for nearly one-fourth of all cancer deaths. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80%-85% of all lung cancer cases. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is revolutionizing the treatment of NSCLC. Immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, can suppress immune responses by delivering negative signals to T cells. By interfering with these immunosuppressive axes, ICIs unleash antitumor immune responses, ultimately eliminating cancer cells. ICIs have demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in NSCLC, and mounting evidence supports the use of ICIs in treatment-na\u00efve patients with advanced NSCLC. A comprehensive overview of current and emerging ICIs for the first-line treatment of NSCLC in China will facilitate a better understanding of NSCLC immunotherapy using ICIs and optimize the clinical use of ICIs in previously untreated Chinese patients with NSCLC. Herein, we review the efficacy and safety of currently approved and investigational ICIs as the first-line treatment of NSCLC in China. We also discuss the challenges limiting more widespread use of ICIs and future directions in the first-line treatment of NSCLC using ICIs.",

However, no study has compared the efficacies of these two regimens. Therefore, we aimed to compare the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression. We conducted a multicenter retrospective trial involving patients with diagnosed unresectable or recurrent NSCLCs who had received pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Patients were divided into monotherapy and combination therapy groups. The progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response rate (RR) were analyzed and compared between the groups. Clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed to assess their possible relationship with treatment outcomes. We enrolled 96 patients from five hospitals. Of these, 47 and 49 patients received monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. The median PFS was 343 and 328\u2009days in the monotherapy and combination therapy groups, respectively (hazard ratio 1.003, p\u00a0=\u00a00.99). No statistically significant differences were observed in the OS and RR between the two groups. However, in patients with metastases to the liver, lung, adrenal glands, bone, or lymph nodes, the PFS was longer in the monotherapy group than in the combination therapy group. Although the PFS, OS, and RR were not significantly different between patients treated with pembrolizumab alone and or with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, patients with NSCLC having metastases to specific sites may benefit more from monotherapy.",

In this study, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of pretreatment tumor tissue samples and pretreatment and on-treatment whole blood samples (WB) samples obtained from a clinically annotated cohort of NSCLC patients (n = 40) treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) monotherapy. Using a single-sample gene set enrichment scoring method, we found that the tumors of responders with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 20) are inherently immunogenic to promote antitumor immunity, whereas those with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, n = 18) have a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings suggested that nivolumab may function as a molecular targeted agent in LUAD and as an immunomodulating agent in LUSC. In addition, our study explains why the reliability of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as a predictive biomarker for the response to nivolumab monotherapy is quite different between LUAD and LUSC.",

    "abstract": "Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score\u2009\u2265\u200950% can be treated with pembrolizumab alone. Our aim was to assess the impact of baseline tumour size (BTS) on overall survival (OS) in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy. This retrospective, multicentre study included all patients with untreated advanced NSCLC receiving either pembrolizumab (PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%) or platinum-based chemotherapy (any PD-L1). The primary endpoint was the impact of BTS (defined as the sum of the dimensions of baseline target lesions according to RECIST v1.1 criteria) on OS. Between 09-2016 and 06-2020, 188 patients were included, 96 in the pembrolizumab (P-group) and 92 in the chemotherapy group (CT-group). The median follow-up was 26.9\u00a0months (range 0.13-37.91) and 44.4\u00a0months (range 0.23-48.62), respectively, while the median BTS was similar, 85.5\u00a0mm (IQR 57.2-113.2) and 86.0\u00a0mm (IQR\u00a053.0-108.5), respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.42).

Several previous reports also demonstrated that the PS is identified as one of the most probable prognostic factors for predicting poor outcomes after ICI treatment. However, first-line pembrolizumab seemed to be effective for lung cancer patients with a PS of 2 if PD-L1 expression was greater than 50%.

    "abstract": "An immune checkpoint blockade with mAbs to PD-1 and PD-L1 is an expanding therapeutic option for mNSCLC patients. This treatment strategy is based on the use of mAbs able to restore the anti-tumor activity of intratumoral T cells inhibited by PD-1 binding to PD-L1/2 on tumor and inflammatory cells. It has been speculated that a chronic status of systemic inflammation as well as the immunosenescence physiologically occurring in elderly patients may affect the efficacy of the treatment and the occurrence of irAEs. We performed a multi-institutional retrospective study aimed at evaluating the effects of these mAbs (nivolumab or atezolizumab) in 117 mNSCLC patients younger (90 cases) and older (27 cases) than 75 years in correlation with multiple inflammatory parameters (NLR, CRP, ESR, LDH and PCT). No differences were observed when the cohorts were compared in terms of the frequency of PFS, OS, inflammatory markers and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Similarly, the occurrence of irAEs was strictly correlated with a prolonged OS survival in both groups. On the contrary, a negative correlation between the high baseline levels of inflammatory markers and OS could be demonstrated in the younger cohort only. Overall, PD-1/PD-L1-blocking mAbs were equally effective in young and elderly mNSCLC patients; however, the detrimental influence of a systemic inflammation at the baseline was only observed in young patients, suggesting different aging-related inflammation immunoregulative effects.",

    "abstract": "First-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone a paradigm shift to platinum combination chemotherapy together with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, regardless of the expression level of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells. Moreover, such chemotherapy plus nivolumab (antibody to PD-1) and ipilimumab (antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4) prolonged survival in advanced NSCLC patients compared with chemotherapy alone. We have now designed a randomized, controlled phase III trial (NIPPON, JCOG2007) to confirm that platinum combination chemotherapy plus nivolumab and ipilimumab is superior to such chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab (antibody to PD-1) for treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. Chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients aged 20 years or older with a performance status of 0 or 1 are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive platinum combination chemotherapy and either pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Patients with known genetic driver alterations such as those affecting EGFR or ALK are excluded. Enrollment of 422 patients over 3 years at 55 oncology facilities throughout Japan is planned. The primary endpoint is overall survival. In addition, as ancillary research, metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota will be performed with fecal samples collected before treatment onset, and the results will be examined for their association to therapeutic effect and adverse events. If the primary endpoint is met, platinum combination chemotherapy together with nivolumab plus ipilimumab will be established as a new, more effective standard treatment for advanced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "In this first-in-human phase 1 study (NCT02964013; MK-7684-001), we investigated the safety and efficacy of the anti-TIGIT (T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain) antibody vibostolimab as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Part A enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors, and part B enrolled patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received vibostolimab 2.1-700 mg alone or with pembrolizumab 200 mg in part A and vibostolimab 200 mg alone or with pembrolizumab 200 mg in part B. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. Part A enrolled 76 patients (monotherapy, 34; combination therapy, 42). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Across doses, 56% of patients receiving monotherapy and 62% receiving combination therapy had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs); grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 9% and 17% of patients, respectively. The most common TRAEs were fatigue (15%) and pruritus (15%) with monotherapy and pruritus (17%) and rash (14%) with combination therapy. Confirmed ORR was 0% with monotherapy and 7% with combination therapy. In part B, 39 patients had anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1)/PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1)-naive NSCLC (all received combination therapy), and 67 had anti-PD-1/PD-L1-refractory NSCLC (monotherapy, 34; combination therapy, 33). In patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-naive NSCLC: 85% had TRAEs-the most common were pruritus (38%) and hypoalbuminemia (31%); confirmed ORR was 26%, with responses occurring in both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors. In patients\u00a0with\u00a0anti-PD-1/PD-L1-refractory NSCLC: 56% receiving monotherapy and 70% receiving combination therapy had TRAEs-the most common were rash and fatigue (21% each) with monotherapy and pruritus (36%) and fatigue (24%) with combination therapy; confirmed ORR was 3% with monotherapy and 3% with combination therapy. Vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including patients with advanced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is advisable to select the appropriate treatment based on characteristics of the cancer such as pathology, mutations, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels. In this study, by remarking squamous NSCLC with low PD-L1 expression without mutations, we investigated the efficacy and safety of regimens that included molecularly targeted drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through a network meta-analysis. Databases were searched systematically to identify appropriate articles, in which randomized trials with incurable squamous NSCLC were described. Suitable studies were manually checked by two reviewers. A random model network meta-analysis was conducted, in which the primary outcome was the overall survival rate. We identified 48 studies, which included 16\u2009391 patients. When a platinum + third-generation cytotoxic agent regimen (platinum regimen) was a reference, the platinum regimen + pembrolizumab (Pemb) yielded the best results in regard to the overall survival rate when compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] =\u20090.36-0.90, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) followed by the platinum regimen + nivolumab (Niv)\u2009+\u2009ipilimumab (Ipi) (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.61, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.44-0.84, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). However, the efficacy of ICI monotherapy was not statistically different from that of the platinum regimen. The combination therapies, which were the platinum regimen + Pemb and the platinum regimen + Niv\u2009+\u2009Ipi, rather than ICI monotherapy were effective first-line agents for treating squamous NSCLC with low PD-L1 levels.",

    "abstract": "Introduction In conducting a survival meta-analysis, the typical methodological\u00a0approach\u00a0analyses the hazard ratios (HRs) of individual trials and then combines them into a pooled meta-analytical estimate.\u00a0The length of follow-up of individual trials is not generally accounted for. Recent techniques aimed at individual patient-data reconstruction from Kaplan-Meier graphs represent an important methodological innovation. These techniques permit the combination of the survival curves published in a single clinical trial\u00a0but are also applicable to more than one trial.\u00a0In the case of multiple trials,\u00a0a meta-analysis can be conducted without using any statistical model of meta-analysis. Methods As an example of this new approach, we applied a technique of individual patient data reconstruction to the Kaplan-Meier graphs of overall survival reported in two phase-III trials, which were conducted on patients with locally advanced/advanced non-small cell lung cancer selected according to their PD-L1 expression status, not previously treated for their metastatic disease. Only subjects with PD-L1 \u226550% were considered for our analysis. The experimental arms received pembrolizumab monotherapy while the control arms were given platinum-based chemotherapy.\u00a0The survival graphs were obtained for both\u00a0trials. For each Kaplan-Meier curve, the graph was firstly digitalized. Then, the Shiny package was used to reconstruct patient-level data. Finally, the pooled survival curves were generated from the reconstructed patient-level data along with the relevant Cox statistics; for this purpose, we used three packages (\"coxph\",\u00a0\"survfit\", and \"ggsurvplot\")\u00a0under the R-platform. Results In our pooled analysis based on this procedure, we compared 453 patients given pembrolizumab vs. 451 controls given chemotherapy.\u00a0The HR estimated from reconstructed\u00a0patient-level data was 0.670 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.566 to 0.793). Conclusion The analysis described herein demonstrates the easy applicability of the Shiny technique. This technique was successful in generating a pooled survival graph for the experimental treatment groups vs. controls and efficiently estimated the pooled HR in which the results of the two trials were combined.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common of them. About a third of NSCLC cases have an epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutation, which is usually susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In rare cases where patients progress through TKI therapy, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains controversial. We describe a case of a patient with significant history of smoking and EGFR mutated programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) positive NSCLC who was initially treated with TKI therapy. While patient progressed on TKI therapy, he was able to achieve a durable response with a single PD-L1 agent, pembrolizumab. Contrary to the available evidence, the presented EGFR mutant NSCLC responded to PD-L1 pathway inhibition. From our observation Pembrolizumab could be promising in patients with rare EGFR mutations who do not respond to EGFR directed therapy. Our report provides supporting data for the use of immunotherapies in patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The predictive role of blood-based tumor mutation burden (bTMB) for selecting advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who might benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is still under debate. Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) /programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors versus that of standard-of-care therapy in patients with NSCLC who were bTMB high and bTMB low. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, the Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched systematically from inception to February 2021 for studies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (durvalumab OR atezolizumab OR avelumab OR pembrolizumab OR Nivolumab) that provided hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS), or odds ratios (ORs) for objective response rate (ORR) in both bTMB high and bTMB low groups. A total of 2338 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC from six randomized controlled trials, which all used chemotherapy (CT) as a control, were included in this study. Compared with CT, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy improved OS (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, P\u2009<\u20090.01), PFS (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.48-0.67, P\u2009<\u20090.01), and ORR (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.84-3.93, P\u2009<\u20090.01) in bTMB-high NSCLC patients but not in bTMB-low patients (OS HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.07, P\u2009=\u20090.17; PFS HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78-1.27, P\u2009=\u20090.98; ORR OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.80, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Subgroup analyses showed that these results were consistent across all subgroups (line of therapy, therapy regimen, type of NGS panel, PD-L1 expression, and cutoff value). Meta-regression analysis showed that the proportion of patients with squamous cell histology had no statistical effect on clinical outcomes. Sensitivity analyses illustrated that all results were stable. The efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy in advanced NSCLC patients may be dependent on bTMB level. Patients with high bTMB tend to obtain significantly better OS, PFS, and ORR from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy than from CT. However, because of multiple limitations, including those related to reproducibility, the results are exploratory and should be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "Tumor size and metastatic extent may influence tumor response to immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between both baseline sum of longest diameters (bSLD) and number of metastatic organs (NMO) and the tumor response to pembrolizumab. Secondly, we aimed to analyze the association of baseline SLD and NMO with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This retrospective study included patients with high PD-L1 expressing tumors (\u226550%) and a good performance score (ECOG\u00a0\u2264\u00a02) that received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. Tumor response was calculated as the 'SLD-change score' and 'early treatment discontinuation' within 3\u00a0months on therapy (ETD). The relationship of both bSLD (based on RECIST v1.1) and NMO with tumor response and survival outcome (PFS, OS) was evaluated. No significant differences in SLD-change score could be found using bSLD (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.010, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.999-1.021), or using NMO at baseline (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.608, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.943-2.743). A bSLD cut-off value of 90\u00a0mm was found to be most distinctive for ETD. This cut-off value showed a significant difference for PFS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.28, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12-4.64, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.99, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.41-6.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). NMO also showed a difference for PFS and OS, however, not statistically significant. Tumor size and metastatic extent could not discriminate for tumor response, however, a bSLD of 90\u00a0mm could differentiate for PFS and OS.",

    "abstract": "Single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like pembrolizumab or atezolizumab have been approved as first-line monotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%. However, emerging evidences have showed that ICI combinations (chemoimmunotherapy\u00a0or dual-agent ICIs) argue to offer a higher response rate. In this network meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of first-line single-agent ICIs versus ICI combinations for advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u2009 50%. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and the Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched to extract eligible literature until December 2020. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) of grades 3-5. Fourteen studies with 3448 patients were included. The results showed that chemotherapy plus ICIs significantly improved PFS and ORR compared to chemotherapy, and sinti-chemo (HR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.20-0.49) and pembro-chemo (OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 2.6-6.7) ranked first. In terms of OS, cemiplimab provided the best benefit versus chemotherapy (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43-0.77), followed by atezolizumab and pembro-chemo. In the subgroup analysis of histological type, pembro-chemo and sinti-chemo showed the best benefit of PFS in squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, respectively, while there was no significant difference between ICI combinations with single-agent ICIs in OS. Moreover, the addition of chemotherapy to ICIs elevated toxicity compared to chemotherapy. The study suggested that chemotherapy plus ICIs might improve PFS and ORR than single-agent ICIs for advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950%. However, it did not lead to OS benefit.",

    "title": "Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy in advanced solid tumours: A review.",
    "abstract": "The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has changed practices in oncology, becoming a new standard of care in first or subsequent lines for several cancer subtypes. Recent data have highlighted the ability of standard chemotherapy to enhance immunogenicity and/or to break immunoresistance of the tumour and its microenvironment, leading to a rationale for the use of ICIs in combination with the standard chemotherapy regimen to improve efficacy of cancer treatment. Here, we propose to review randomised clinical trials evaluating concomitant administration of ICIs and chemotherapy, to assess clinical efficacy and safety profiles in advanced solid tumours. Association of these two modes of action on treatments has shown improved overall survival and better objective response rates than standard chemotherapy, especially in first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for PD1/PD-L1 enriched tumours, highlighting a potential synergistic effect of this treatment combination in certain tumour types. However, improved survival results with the use of anti-PD-L1 avelumab as a maintenance schedule for bladder cancer raises the question of the most appropriate approach\u00a0between sequential and concomitant administration of chemoimmunotherapy. To date, no trials have compared in a head-to-head protocol the administration of concomitant chemoimmunotherapy with chemotherapy, used for tumour debulking, followed by administration of ICIs. Regarding the tolerance profile, no new safety signals were found with the combination tested to date. Interestingly, recent results have shown an improved Progression Free survival 2 (PFS2) (defined as the progression after the next line of therapy) in head-and-neck cancers or NSCLC after a first-line pembrolizumab-chemotherapy combination, suggesting a potential long-lasting effect of ICIs when used in combination in the first-line setting.",

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the significance of clinicopathological factors, particularly the immunohistochemistry of programed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), in eight cases each of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) at our hospital. From January 2004 to December 2020, a total of 16 consecutive patients (eight with PSC and eight with MPM diagnosed via surgical resection or biopsy) were included in this study. After retrospectively reviewing the patient characteristics, the associations between PD-L1 status and age, sex, stage, histological type, and prognosis were investigated. PD-L1-positive staining was observed in four (50%) PSC cases and one (12.5%) MPM case. Among the four PD-L1-positive PSC cases, two showed high PD-L1 expression in the vimentin-positive sarcomatoid compartment. Moreover, among those with PSC, two survived for about 10\u2009years, whereas the others died within 5\u2009years. No clear correlation was found between PD-L1 expression and prognosis. Among the patients with MPM, four survived for more than 2\u2009years, with the longest being 9\u2009years. Among MPM cases who received nivolumab, one patient with positive PD-L1 staining in the sarcomatoid survived, whereas the other with negative PD-L1 staining did not. The present study showed that sarcomatoid carcinoma had a higher PD-L1 expression compared to non-small-cell lung cancer and that both PSC and MPM tended to exhibit PD-L1 positivity in the sarcomatoid compartment. Moreover, while immune checkpoint inhibitors may somewhat prolong the prognosis of both tumors, further studies with a larger cohort are necessary to confirm our results.",

    "abstract": "In CheckMate 227, nivolumab plus ipilimumab prolonged overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy in patients with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) greater than or equal to 1% (primary end point) or less than 1% (prespecified descriptive analysis). We report results with minimum 4 years' follow-up. Adults with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC were randomized (1:1:1) to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab, or chemotherapy (PD-L1 \u22651%); or to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy (PD-L1 <1%). Efficacy included OS and other measures. Safety included timing and management of immune-mediated adverse events (AEs). A post hoc analysis evaluated efficacy in patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab due to treatment-related AEs (TRAEs). After 54.8 months' median follow-up, OS remained longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 greater than or equal to 1% (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.90) and PD-L1 less than 1% (0.64; 0.51-0.81); 4-year OS rate with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy was 29% versus 18% (PD-L1 \u22651%); and 24% versus 10% (PD-L1 <1%). Benefits were observed in both squamous and nonsquamous histologies. In a descriptive analysis, efficacy was improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab relative to nivolumab (PD-L1 \u22651%) and nivolumab plus chemotherapy (PD-L1 <1%). Safety was consistent with previous reports. The most common immune-mediated AE with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab plus chemotherapy was rash; most immune-mediated AEs (except endocrine events) occurred within 6 months from start of treatment and resolved within 3 months after, mainly with systemic corticosteroids. Patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab due to TRAEs had long-term OS benefits, as seen in the all randomized population. At more than 4 years' minimum follow-up, with all patients off immunotherapy treatment for at least 2 years, first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to demonstrate durable long-term efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC. No new safety signals were identified. Immune-mediated AEs occurred early and resolved quickly with guideline-based management. Discontinuation of nivolumab plus ipilimumab due to TRAEs did not have a negative impact on the long-term benefits seen in all randomized patients.",

The study developed a five-health state Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab consolidation therapy in post-chemoradiotherapy patients based on the PACIFIC clinical trial. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. Durvalumab consolidation therapy provided an additional 1.22 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with an incremental cost of $24,397 compared to no consolidation therapy in unselected patients. Durvalumab consolidation therapy was cost-effective as it yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $20,000 per QALY gained at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $31,494 per QALY. In the patient subgroup with PD-L1-expressing tumors (\u22651%), durvalumab was associated with an ICER of $33,058/QALY, resulting in a slight skewing away from the given cost-effectiveness threshold. The sensitivity analysis showed that ICERs were most sensitive to the cost of durvalumab, the cost of pembrolizumab, and the body weight of patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression selection. Durvalumab consolidation therapy is likely to be cost-effective in China, which indicates that expensive immunotherapies can gain clinical benefits at a justifiable cost in developing countries as well.",

Relevant databases were searched for eligible trials. A well-accepted adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) approach was selected to pool efficacy results and safety outcomes. Subgroup analyses were stratified according to PD-L1 expression and clinical characteristics. Four eligible randomized trials (CheckMate9LA, KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE 189, KEYNOTE 407) involving 2017 patients were available to analyze. The ITC results suggested that N-I + chemo is comparable to Pem + chemo in OS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.30) and ORR (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.06), but tended to yield inferior PFS (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59) than did Pem + chemo. As for safety profiles, N-I + chemo showed no significant difference relative to Pem + chemo in any grade adverse events: (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.10), but demonstrated reduced toxicity in chemo-related adverse events, such as anemia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), neutropenia (RR0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.79), and thrombocytopenia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.69). N-I + chemo is a promising treatment option for providing comparable OS related to Pem + chemo. However, for never smoker female patients, Pem + chemo is preferable to choose for demonstrating favorable OS benefit than N-I + chemo.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. There is a rank order of the efficacy and safety of treatment options, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), bevacizumab (Bev), and cytotoxic drugs. When patients have low programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, there are multiple options for treatment. In this study, we focused on ICI regimens in patients with non-squamous NSCLC with low PD-L1 expression and no driver alterations and assessed the efficacy of the regimens using network meta-analysis. Randomized trials for incurable chemo-na\u00efve non-squamous NSCLC were collected through electronic searches. The data were independently extracted and cross-checked by two investigators. The primary outcome of this analysis was overall survival (OS). A frequentist weighted least-squares approach random-model network meta-analysis was applied.

    "abstract": "Whether smokers respond to anti-cancer drugs differently than non-smokers remains controversial. The objective of this study is to explore whether the better response of the smokers is specific to therapy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1, anti-checkpoint inhibitor, individual drugs on the cell surface, or lung cancer. Our results showed that among all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, when the data from anti-PD-1/PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, and anti-MUC1 drugs are combined, the mean hazard ratios (HR) of smokers and non-smokers were 0.751 and 1.016, respectively. A meta-analysis with a fixed effect (FE) model indicated that the smokers have an HR value of 0.023 lower than that of the non-smokers. A stratified subgroup meta-analysis indicated that when treated with anti-CTLA-4 drugs, smokers had reduced HR values of 0.152 and 0.165 on average and FE model meta-analysis, respectively. When treated with an anti-MUC1 drug, smokers had reduced HR values of 1.563 and 0.645, on average and FE model meta-analysis, respectively. When treated with a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab drugs, smokers had, on average, reduced HR and FE model meta-analysis values (0.257 and 0.141), respectively. Smoking is a clinical response predictor for anti-PD/PD-L1 monotherapy or first-line treatment in lung, urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck cancer. Smokers treated with other drugs have shown worse responses in comparison to non-smokers. These data suggest that, along with the progress in the development of new drugs for cancer, drugs acting on specific genotypes of smokers likely will arise.",

Treatment consisted of pembrolizumab 200\u00a0mg every 3\u00a0weeks (35 cycles) or platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). The primary end-point was progression-free survival; secondary end-points included overall survival and safety. Of 305 patients randomized in KEYNOTE-024 overall, 40 patients were enrolled in Japan (all received treatment: pembrolizumab, n\u00a0=\u00a021; chemotherapy, n\u00a0=\u00a019). The hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival by independent central review (data cut-off date, 10 July 2017) was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.64; one-sided, nominal P\u00a0=\u00a0.001).

Novel treatment strategies are under investigation to improve the survival of patients with ATC. We present a case of recurrent ATC treated with a combination of radiation therapy (RT) and pembrolizumab, a programmed death-1 inhibitor, with a durable complete response. A 63-year-old woman underwent total thyroidectomy and left neck lymph node dissection and was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma in December, 2017. She received radioiodine in April, 2018. However, a left neck mass was noted in April, 2018 with biopsy demonstrating ATC with 95% positivity for programmed death-ligand 1 immunostaining. Positron emission tomography showed fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the left thyroid bed and multiple lymph nodes in the left retropharyngeal, left neck, and right upper paratracheal areas. Hypofractionated RT for the recurrent areas was initiated in August,2018, and concomitant pembrolizumab was given 2 days after RT. A total of 10 cycles of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) were given every 3 weeks. The computed tomography scan after completion of RT and 3 cycles of pembrolizumab showed shrinkage of the neck lymph nodes. The serial follow-up computed tomography scans showed further shrinkage of the lymph nodes, and there was no recurrence of ATC as of October, 2020. We describe an ATC case successfully treated with a combination of RT and pembrolizumab with a durable response of 26 months and acceptable toxicities. This result warrants further investigation of this combination regimen in the treatment of ATC.",

In the phase 2 JASPER study (NCT04475939), the PARP inhibitor niraparib was evaluated in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients whose tumors had programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion scores (TPS) \u226550% (cohort 1) or 1%-49% (cohort 2) received first-line niraparib (200 mg once daily) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks). The primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and pharmacokinetics. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in cohorts 1 and 2. In cohort 1, ORR (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 56.3% (9 of 16 patients; 29.9%-80.2%); 2 of 16 patients had complete responses and 7 of 16 had partial responses (PRs). In cohort 2, ORR was 20.0% (5.7%-43.7%) with 4 of 20 PRs. In cohorts 1 and 2, the median DoR was 19.7 months (95% CI, 4.2 months to not estimable [NE]) and 9.4 months (95% CI, 4.2 months to NE), the median PFS was 8.4 months (95% CI, 3.9-22.1 months) and 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.0-6.2 months), and the median OS was NE (95% CI, 6.0 months to NE) and 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.0-12.5 months), respectively. Grade \u22653 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 88.2% and 85.7% of patients in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Safety was consistent with known profiles of single-agent niraparib and pembrolizumab. Niraparib plus pembrolizumab showed clinical activity in patients with advanced and/or metastatic NSCLC. The JASPER clinical trial studied a new combination treatment for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pembrolizumab, a drug approved for NSCLC, was given with niraparib. Previous research showed that these 2 drugs together might work better than either drug alone. This study found that more than half of patients with high levels of a tumor marker responded to the combination, and one-fifth of patients with lower levels of the marker responded. The types of side effects from the combination were similar to side effects from both drugs alone. These results support more research on this combination.",

    "abstract": "There are no established biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with high programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. In this study, we investigated whether the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and body mass index (BMI) can be used to evaluate the effect of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who express high levels of PD-L1. We reviewed data from 142 patients with high PD-L1 expression who underwent first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC at six Japanese institutions between February 2017 and June 2019 and assessed the prognostic value of the GPS, NLR, and BMI. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The GPS, NLR, and BMI were calculated using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and body weight and height, respectively. The GPS independently predicted the first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy efficacy, as a good GPS (GPS 0-1) was associated with a significantly better PFS and OS compared to a poor GPS (GPS 2) (PFS: 11.8 vs. 2.9\u00a0months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; OS: not reached vs. 8.3\u00a0months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Furthermore, BMI independently predicted efficacy, as patients with high BMI (BMI \u226521.4) exhibited significantly better OS compared to those with low BMI (BMI <21.4) (OS: not reached vs. 14.1\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Among patients with high PD-L1 expression undergoing first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC, the GPS is significantly correlated with both PFS and OS, and BMI with OS, indicating that they could be used to predict treatment outcome in these patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationship among the GPS, NLR, and BMI and survival among patients with high PD-L1 expression undergoing first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC.",

We retrospectively compared their efficacy and safety. We reviewed the efficacy and safety of first-line pembrolizumab-containing regimens administered between 2017 and 2020 to consecutive patients. The patients were divided into a pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (Combo group) or monotherapy group (Mono group). To compare the efficacy, we monitored the time to failure of strategy (TFS) defined as the time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of one of the following events: the addition of any drug not included in the primary strategy, progression of cancer after complete therapy, progression and no subsequent therapy, or death, whichever occurred first. We used the propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce the bias. A total of 126 patients were identified (89 in the Mono group and 37 in the Combo group). PSM matched 36 individuals from each of the two groups. The overall response rate and median progression-free survival of the Combo group were better than those of the Mono group. However, the median TFS was almost the same (11.3\u00a0months vs. 14.9\u00a0months; hazard ratio 1.40 [95% confidence interval 0.62-3.15]). The frequency of all serious adverse effects was higher in the Combo group than in the Mono group. Due to similar efficacy in TFS, both pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and monotherapy are valid options for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The programmed death 1 and ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors have significantly altered therapeutic perspectives on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their efficacy and safety are unknown since direct clinical trials have not yet been performed on them. It is also necessary to determine the economics of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors due to their high cost. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients in China with high PD-L1 expression as first-line treatment. From the PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases, we retrieved survival, progression, and safety data on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to consider PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in efficacy and safety. A Markov model with a full-lifetime horizon was adopted. Clinical and utility data were collected through the trial. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed. This study included five phase III clinical trials using four drugs: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab. The NMA demonstrated that the four drugs had similar efficacy and safety, while pembrolizumab and atezolizumab were better for than for nivolumab (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.66, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.46-0.95 and HR\u00a0=\u00a00.59, 95%CI: 0.37-0.94) in progression-free survival (PFS), and the risk of a severe adverse event was higher for atezolizumab than for nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Compared with nivolumab, durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab had QALY of 0.19, 0.38, and 0.53, respectively, which induced ICERs of $\u00a0197,028.8/QALY, $\u00a0111,859.0/QALY, and $\u00a076,182.3/QALY, respectively. The efficacy and safety are similar among types of PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor monotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab appears optimal, but the other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are not as cost-effective for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in China.",

In addition, pseudoprogression has increased the difficulty in immunotherapy management and data on the incidence of pseudoprogression in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions (ex20ins) is rarely reported. Here, we discuss the case of an advanced lung adenocarcinoma patient with EGFR ex20ins alteration. The patient received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line therapy and disease control was achieved. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 9\u00a0months. The patient was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab plus docetaxel and bevacizumab as second-line therapy and the disease remained stable. After two cycles of first-line treatment, the patient showed improvement in performance and the primary left upper lung lesion was stable; however, there was an increase in size as well as number of small diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules. Therapy was maintained with the original regimen and complete regression of the bilateral lung nodules was achieved after a third cycle of treatment. Pseudoprogression was diagnosed. In the case reported here, we advocate the use of a PD-L1 inhibitor plus conventional chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR ex20ins mutation and hope that our experience might be beneficial to other clinicians in distinguishing pseudoprogression from true progression.",

Here we report the case of a patient presenting synchronously with metastatic melanoma to multiple regional lymph nodes and stage I lung adenocarcinoma with high Programmed-Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Given the high-risk nature of his melanoma, he was treated with nivolumab monotherapy, and had a durable response of both malignancies to a PD-1 inhibitor. He remains disease-free, off therapy sixteen months after completing a 19-month course of treatment. This highlights the complexity of treating patients with MPMTs in the era of effective immunotherapy and raises the possibility of treating primary lung cancer with systemic immunotherapy in situations in which surgery is not feasible due to comorbidities or other circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) are a common yet problematic phenomenon\u00a0in patients who are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Current research efforts have explored the exact pathophysiology of IRAEs in the clinical setting. However, a rare subset of IRAEs that is less highlighted and may cause detrimental effects are hematological IRAEs (heme-IRAEs). Of note, immune-induced eosinophilia itself is a heme-IRAE that is worthy of further investigation. In this report, we present two cases of advanced staged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with single-agent pembrolizumab, and who subsequently sustained markedly elevated eosinophil counts (EEC) on laboratory findings. The two patients\u00a0were Caucasian and both were diagnosed with NSCLC, although with differing histologies: a 76-year-old male with adenocarcinoma and a 66-year-old female with squamous cell carcinoma. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular tumor profiling did not show any actionable oncogenic mutations. Both patients were treatment-na\u00efve and received pembrolizumab as first-line systemic therapy. The male patient, a former heavy smoker, underwent 18 months of pembrolizumab treatment before high eosinophil counts and was diagnosed with immunotherapy-related apoptotic colopathy after colonoscopy. Following pembrolizumab discontinuation, he remains under surveillance with good disease control and does not show any ongoing symptoms. The female patient, a never-smoker, underwent 15 cycles of pembrolizumab before the discontinuation of the treatment after consistently high levels of eosinophil counts. Both patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids after the discontinuation of immunotherapy, and their eosinophil levels returned to normal values. However, the female patient declined any further therapy and expired 24 months after the discontinuation of immunotherapy. Immune-induced eosinophilia is a rare event and reported in\u00a0only 2.9% of NSCLC cases. Outcomes in the two patients differed, indicating that further research related to eosinophilia and its causes in the context of varying histologies and clinical profiles of patients is warranted.",

For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and poor performance status (PS), the availability of sensitivity markers to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) would be useful for attending physicians and assist them in their decision-making process. Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) can lead to high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and coexist with mutations in polymerase proofreading (DNA polymerase Epsilon POLE and delta 1 POLD1) with a specific mutational signature. This would result in high tumor mutational burden and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpression. We report herein on a NSCLC case with MSI-H and POLE mutation in a patient with inaugural poor general condition, who exhibited prolonged response to anti-programmed cell death protein (PD-1) therapy.

    "title": "Recent advances in immune checkpoint therapy in non-small cell lung cancer and opportunities for nanoparticle-based therapy.",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer with the highest mortality rate and a poor 5-year survival rate. The majority of the cases are diagnosed in advanced stages when the disease has spread, which makes the tumor inoperable. Due to the antigenic essence of lung tumor cells, immunotherapy is a novel area and has exhibited remarkable results in this malignancy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are inhibitory molecules that disrupt immune checkpoint signaling pathways whether in the immune cells or tumor cells. Tremelimumab and ipilimumab (CTLA-4 blockers), pembrolizumab and nivolumab (PD-1 blockers), and durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab (PD-L1 blockers) are FDA-approved and improve the survival and objective response of NSCLC patients. Despite this, over-stimulation of the immune system via the immune checkpoint therapy is a double-edged sword that causes a spectrum of adverse events from moderate to life-threatening. Nanomedicine considerably impacts the way of diagnosis and treatment of tumors to overcome treatment-related challenges. Accordingly, nanoparticle-based immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy increases the local concentration of immune checkpoint inhibitors while reduces the side effects, which result in boosting the anti-tumor immunity against various types of malignancies, including NSCLC. The current review provides comprehensive information about immune checkpoint therapy in NSCLC, their efficacy, and their safety profile. Besides, recent advances in nanoparticle-based immune checkpoint therapy and its limitation are discussed.",

Prospective data of thirty-three consecutive patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC treated with CRT and sequential durvalumab (67%, 22 patients) or concurrent and sequential nivolumab (33%, 11 patients) were analyzed. Different PTV cut offs and PTV as a continuous variable were evaluated for their association with progression-free (PFS), local-regional progression-free (LRPFS), extracranial distant metastasis-free (eMFS) and brain-metastasis free-survival (BMFS). All patients were treated with conventionally fractionated thoracic radiotherapy (TRT); 93% to a total dose of at least 60\u00a0Gy, 97% of patients received two cycles of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 19.9 (range: 6.0-42.4) months; median overall survival (OS), LRFS, BMFS and eMFS were not reached. Median PFS was 22.8 (95% CI: 10.7-34.8) months. Patients with PTV\u2009\u2265\u2009900ccm had a significantly shorter PFS (6.9 vs 22.8\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.020) and eMFS (8.1\u00a0months vs. not reached, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Furthermore, patients with PTV\u2009\u2265\u2009900ccm and stage IIIC disease (UICC-TNM Classification 8th Edition) achieved a very poor outcome with a median PFS and eMFS of 3.6 vs 22.8\u00a0months (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 3.6\u00a0months vs. not reached (p\u2009=\u20090.001), respectively. PTV as a continuous variable also had a significant impact on eMFS (p\u2009=\u20090.048).

We search PubMed and the proceedings of international oncology meetings to perform a systematic review to assess the outcomes poor PS NSCLC patients who received ICIs as first-line treatment. A meta-analysis included retrospective studies focusing on pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 \u226550% NSCLC. We reported the global objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and landmark progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) in ECOG PS \u22652 and 0-1 patients, respectively. Forty-one studies were included in the systematic review. Thirty-two retrospective studies focused on pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 \u226550% cases. In total, 1,030 out of 5,357 (19%) of patients across 30 studies presented with a PS \u22652 at pembrolizumab initiation. In 18 studies with detailed clinical information, worse outcomes in poor PS compared to good PS patients were documented. The meta-analysis revealed that ORR and DCR within the PS \u22652 patient population were 30.9% and 41.5% respectively (55.2% and 71.5% in PS 0-1 patients). The rates of PFS (at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months) and OS (at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months) were approximately double in the good PS compared to the poor PS group of patients. In the three prospective trials where of ICIs in PS 2 populations, the diverse strictness in PS definition likely contributed to the differential outcomes observed.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have caused a paradigm shift in the treatment landscape of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Real-world practice may be different from randomized studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the real-world pembrolizumab efficacy with or without chemotherapy. All consecutive patients aged over 18 years who were diagnosed as metastatic NSCLC and received at least one dose of first-line pembrolizumab treatment were retrospectively reviewed. The patients hadn't received no previous systemic therapy. A total of 44 patients treated with pembrolizumab were enrolled. Just over half (51.2%) of the patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) \uf0b32, and 36.4% had liver metastasis. There were no patients with driver mutations, 18.2% had programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) \uf0b350% expression and 82.3% were treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.0 months (95% CI: 0.9-5.0 months) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 0.7-12.4 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified liver metastasis and adrenal metastasis as independent predictors of OS. PFS, OS, objective response and disease control rate results were significantly worse than in randomized studies. ICIs are not an infallible treatment option to be used for every patient with advanced NSCLC encountered in daily clinical practice. Attention should be payed to stringent eligibility criteria used in randomized studies as much as possible and try to manage patients according to these criteria.",

Pneumonitis is a rare but known complication of pembrolizumab treatment for NSCLC. The median time frame of its appearance is 2.8 months. However, we present a case of pneumonitis appearing within 48 hours. The patient presented with rapidly progressive respiratory failure, and imaging demonstrated diffuse bilateral patchy involvement of the upper lung lobe and pre-hilar regions, which likely indicate pneumonitis. Because of likely grade 3 pneumonitis, he was treated with steroids and showed immediate improvement of symptoms. Repeated CT imaging showed resolution of bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was discharged to the rehabilitation unit. Rapid recognition of pneumonitis as a side effect of pembrolizumab is important because early treatment can help prevent respiratory failure and possible death.",

    "abstract": "This exploratory analysis retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC to determine whether baseline brain metastases influenced the efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. We pooled data for patients with advanced NSCLC in KEYNOTE-021 cohort G (nonsquamous), KEYNOTE-189 (nonsquamous), and KEYNOTE-407 (squamous). Patients were assigned to platinum-doublet chemotherapy with or without the addition of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. All studies permitted enrollment of patients with previously treated or untreated (KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 only) stable brain metastases. Patients with previously treated brain metastases were clinically stable for 2 or more weeks (\u22654 wk in KEYNOTE-021 cohort G), had no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and had no steroid use at least 3 days before dosing. Patients with known untreated asymptomatic brain metastases required regular imaging of the brain. A total of 1298 patients were included, 171 with and 1127 without baseline brain metastases. Median (range) durations of follow-up at data cutoff were 10.9 (0.1\u201235.1) and 11.0 (0.1\u201234.9) months, respectively. Hazard ratios (pembrolizumab\u00a0+ chemotherapy/chemotherapy) were similar for patients with and without brain metastases for overall survival (0.48 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32\u20120.70] and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.53\u20120.75], respectively) and progression-free survival (0.44 [95% CI: 0.31\u20120.62] and 0.55 [95% CI: 0.48\u20120.63], respectively). In patients with brain metastases, median overall survival was 18.8 months with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and 7.6 months with chemotherapy, and median progression-free survival was 6.9 months and 4.1 months, respectively. Objective response rates were higher and duration of response longer with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy regardless of brain metastasis status. Incidences of treatment-related adverse events with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy were 88.2% versus 82.8% among patients with brain metastases and 94.5% versus 90.6% in those without. With or without brain metastasis, pembrolizumab plus platinum-based histology-specific chemotherapy improved clinical outcomes versus chemotherapy alone across all programmed death ligand 1 subgroups, including patients with programmed death ligand 1 tumor proportion score less than 1% and had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced NSCLC. This regimen is a standard-of-care treatment option for treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, including patients with stable brain metastases.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy (PM) both become standard of care in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) greater than 50%. This study aimed to figure out the better treatment choice. In this retrospective analysis, we compared the clinical efficacy of PM and PC as first-line treatment in NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 \u226550% and negative for genomic alterations in the EGFR and ALK genes. Among the population, 115 patients received PC, and 91 patients received PM. Up to Dec 30, 2020, median follow-up was 17.13 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) rates of PC and PM were 12.37 and 9.60 months (HR: 0.44, p < 0.001), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) rates were NE and 28.91 months (HR: 0.40, p = 0.005), respectively. Subgroup analysis found that the PFS benefit of PC was evident in most subgroups excepting patients with brain metastasis. The 1-year overall survival rates of PC and PM were 89.3% and 76.1%, respectively. The ORR was 61.7 and 46.9% (p = 0.004), respectively. In patients with previously untreated, PD-L1 \u226550%, advanced NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard platinum-based chemotherapy seems to be the preferred treatment, which needs to be validated by further prospective trials.",

In recent years, the treatment of lung cancers has largely evolved, in which programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) together with its ligand PD Ligand-1 (PD-L1) has become a prevalent target of interest. Being effective to improve the survivability of cancer patients, monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy that inhibits PD-1 and PD-L1 is playing a vital role in treating a wide spectrum of cancers. Increasing cases of using diversified monoclonal antibodies combined with anlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC have been reported. Herein, we report a case of treating advanced lung adenocarcinoma with the combination of nivolumab and anlotinib. After two cycles of the combination therapy, the patient's condition was effectively improved, demonstrated that this therapy might be effective in treating lung adenocarcinoma.",

Here, we reported an advanced lung adenocarcinoma case concurrent with EGFR sensitive mutation and high PD-L1 expression (>50%) that was administrated with gefitinib firstly, and then became resistant to EGFR-TKI. He received the strategy of immunity-combined chemo-radiotherapy and responded significantly. However, the disease re-progressed after 10 months. Surprisingly, the tumor re-sensitized to gefitinib for 13 months. At final, following the treatment pressure of TKI-IO combination therapy-TKI strategy, tumor clone eventually transformed into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). For one thing, our study provided novel approach and extended the treatment spectra of overcoming immunotherapy resistance after EGFR resistance in driver oncogene-mutated NSCLC. For another thing, our case is the first time to report that SCLC transformation can be achieved after gefitinib-pembrolizumab-gefitinib resistance in EGFR sensitive mutation NSCLC, providing a new condition for SCLC transformation.",

We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of these therapeutic options. We included phase III randomized controlled trials comparing two or more treatments in the first-line setting for NSCLC, including data in PD-L1-negative patients. First-line strategies were compared and ranked based on the effectiveness in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A rank was assigned to each treatment after Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. Fourteen trials involving 14 regimens matched our eligibility criteria. For OS, none of the treatment were significantly more effective than chemotherapy. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was probably the best option based on analysis of the treatment ranking (probability = 30.1%). For PFS, nivolumab plus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, atezolizumab plus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, and atezolizumab plus chemotherapy were statistically superior to chemotherapy in pairwise comparison. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was likely to be the preferred option based on the analysis of the treatment ranking (probability = 72.9%). Nivolumab plus chemotherapy, in combination with angiogenesis inhibition or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), had maximal benefits for NSCLC patient of PD-L1-negative expression. These findings may facilitate individualized treatment strategies. Safety at an individual patient level should be considered in decision making. Further validation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the impact of first-line treatment on overall survival (OS) may be influenced by subsequent therapies. Thus, using patient-level data, we assessed the relationships of progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS) with OS among patients with high-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression undergoing first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC. We reviewed data from 133 patients with high PD-L1 expression undergoing first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC at 6 Japanese centers between February 2017 and December 2018. The correlations of PFS and PPS with OS were evaluated at the patient level. Linear regression analyses and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient revealed that PPS was strongly correlated with OS (r = 0.76, p < 0.05, R2 = 0.65), while PFS was only moderately correlated with OS (r = 0.71, p < 0.05, and R2 = 0.4). Furthermore, PPS was significantly associated with performance status at the end of pembrolizumab monotherapy, as well as the use of platinum-based combination chemotherapy after pembrolizumab monotherapy (both p < 0.05). Among patients with high PD-L1 expression undergoing first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC, PPS was more strongly correlated with OS, relative to the relationship between PFS and OS. Therefore, subsequent treatment appears to significantly influence OS in patients with disease progression following first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have recently been shown to have clinical benefits in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The novel tumour responses to these agents are changing the management of patients with cancer. Pseudo-progression of disease (pseudo-PD), that is, an initial flare followed by shrinkage of the tumour, has been described as a distinctive response to ICIs. However, pseudo-PD manifest initial progression and is difficult to segregate with hyper progressive disease (HPD). We, therefore, analysed a case with pseudo-PD histologically. A 68-year-old Japanese man with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was treated by anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab). Four weeks later after second time treatment with pembrolizumab, the patient showed severe melena followed by Trousseau syndrome and died at day 174 after first treatment by pembrolizumab, suggesting HPD clinically. Primary lesion and metastatic lesions were analysed histologically. Histological analysis revealed that NSCLC cells expressed PD-L1, and CD8+ tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs) were observed. CD8+ TILs showed higher rates of PD-1 indicating that lesions were of the inflamed type and the case was pseudo-PD. Furthermore, it was found that cancer cells expressed MUC1. The clinical appearance of the case was aggressive after treatment by pembrolizumab, and the case seemed to be HPD; however, histological analysis revealed that the case was likely pseudo-PD. Therefore, careful histological evaluation is important when investigating the clinical response to an ICI and mucin expression might be a predictive marker for Trousseau syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is approved in monotherapy for the first-line (1L) of advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 (\u226550%). Despite a proportion of patients achieve long-term survival, about one-third of patients experience detrimental survival outcomes, including early death, hyperprogression, and fast progression. The impact of clinical factors on early progression (EP) development has not been widely explored. We designed a retrospective, multicenter study involving five Italian centers, in patients with metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 \u2265\u200950%, treated with Pembrolizumab in a 1L setting. EP was defined as a progressive disease within three months from pembrolizumab initiation. Baseline clinical factors of patients with and without EP were collected and analyzed. Logistic regression was performed to identify clinical factors associated with EP and an EP prognostic score was developed based on the logistic model. Overall, 321 out of 336 NSCLC patients treated with 1L pembrolizumab provided all the data for the analysis. EP occurred in 137 (42.7%) patients; the median PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.9-4.7), and median OS was not reached in the entire study population. Sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), steroids, metastatic sites \u22652, and the presence of liver/pleural metastasis were confirmed as independent factors for EP by multivariate analysis. By combining these factors, we developed an EP prognostic score ranging from 0-13, with three-risk group stratification: 0-2 (good prognosis), 3-6 (intermediate prognosis), and 7-13 (poor prognosis). The area under the curve (AUC) of the model was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.81). We identified six clinical factors independently associated with EP. We developed a prognostic score model for EP-risk to potentially improve clinical practice and patient selection for 1L pembrolizumab in NSCLC with high PD-L1, in the real-world clinical setting.",

However, this therapy can be associated to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and high cost. Therefore, finding reliable biomarkers of response and irAEs is strongly encouraged to accurately select patients who may potentially benefit from the immuno-oncological treatment. This is a retrospective multi-institutional analysis performed on ninety-five mNSCLC patients who received real-world salvage therapy with nivolumab or atezolizumab between December 2015 and April 2020. The outcome of these patients in term of PFS and OS was evaluated in comparison with different serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimention Rate (ESR) and Procalcitonin (PCT) by performing Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test and multivariate analysis. We found that high baseline levels of CRP, ESR, and PCT were strongly predictive of poor outcome (P <0.05) with the worse prognosis detected in those patients with a baseline levels of both ESR and PCT over the pre-established cut off (median OS recorded in patients with no marker over the cut off ",

Therefore, we investigated the role of pretreatment lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) as biomarker in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients with high PD-L1 expression levels and receiving pembrolizumab as first line. We retrospectively identified 117 patients divided into three prognostic groups (good, intermediate and poor) according to LIPI score. We found that patients belonging to good prognostic group (LIPI score 0) lived longer and responded better than those of intermediate and poor prognostic groups (LIPI score 1 or 2), confirming the correlation between LIPI score and survival and response outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is currently used in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer without  Lay abstract Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of lung cancer. Most NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and only 10\u201315% of them are alive after 5\u00a0years. In the absence of specific tumor mutations, the currently recommended treatment is a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy with the monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab. The goal of immunotherapy is to prevent cancer from evading the immune system by interacting with molecules expressed at the surface of tumor cells (PD-L1) or immune cells (PD-1). A study comparing chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone has never been performed in patients with a high level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. Therefore\u00a0we designed the PERSEE study to compare these treatments in advanced-stage NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression on\u00a0\u226550% of tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are approved for multiple tumor types. However, resistance poses substantial clinical challenges. We conducted a phase I trial of CD40 agonist APX005M (sotigalimab) and CSF1R inhibitor cabiralizumab with or without nivolumab using a 3+3 dose-escalation design (NCT03502330). Patients were enrolled from June 2018 to April 2019. Eligibility included patients with biopsy-proven advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1. APX005M was dose escalated (0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) with a fixed dose of cabiralizumab with or without nivolumab every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Twenty-six patients (12 melanoma, 1 NSCLC, and 13 RCC) were enrolled in six cohorts, 17 on nivolumab-containing regimens. Median duration of follow-up was 21.3 months. The most common treatment-related adverse events were asymptomatic elevations of lactate dehydrogenase ( This first in-human study of patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-resistant tumors treated with dual macrophage-polarizing therapy, with or without nivolumab demonstrated safety and pharmacodynamic activity. Optimization of the dosing frequency and sequence of this combination is warranted.",

New immune checkpoints such as T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3/CD223), T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) have also been gradually found besides the traditional immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), which greatly enriches the choice of tumor immunotherapy. Related immune checkpoint inhibitors including CTLA4 inhibitors such as ipilimumab and tremelimumab, PD-1/programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have been prepared and applied in the therapy of solid tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, digestive tract tumors and so on, which have get a huge success. However, immune-related adverse events and drug resistance should also be paid enough attention.

Between June 2017 and July 2019, this study enrolled treatment-na\u00efve patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 alterations. They were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive nivolumab or placebo in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab/placebo with bevacizumab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Overall, 550 patients from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were randomized; of these patients, 273 and 275 received the nivolumab and placebo combinations, respectively. In the present preplanned interim analysis with a median follow up of 13.7 months, the IRRC-assessed median PFS was significantly longer in the nivolumab arm than in the placebo arm (12.1 versus 8.1 months; hazard ratio 0.56; 96.4% confidence interval 0.43-0.71; P < 0.0001). The PFS benefit was observed across all patients with any programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels including PD-L1-negative patients. The IRRC-assessed objective response rates were 61.5% and 50.5% in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was comparable between the two arms; treatment-related adverse events leading to death were observed in five and four patients in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. The TASUKI-52 regimen should be considered a viable new treatment strategy for treatment-na\u00efve patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonia (CIP) is a serious side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. There is a consensus on the treatment of acute phase of CIP, but the treatment of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the acute phase is still a clinical problem to be solved. The diagnosis and treatment of a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient with immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonia in the Stereotactic Radiotherapy Department of Qingdao Central Hospital were retrospectively analyzed, and literatures were reviewed. A 70-year-old male patient was diagnosed with Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of left lung with mediastinal lymph node metastasis T3N3M0 stage IIIc, EGFR/ALK/ROS1/RAF negative, PD-L1 (22c3) immunohistochemistry negative. After the progression of first-line chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed as immune checkpoint inhibitor associated pneumonia grade 3 during second-line monotherapy with Nivolumab. After initial high-dose glucocorticoid pulse therapy, the lung computed tomography (CT) imaging and clinical symptoms of the patients were partially relieved, and then pirfenidone (300 mg tid) was given orally for more than 11 months. During the treatment of pirfenidone, the CT imaging and clinical symptoms of the patients were significantly improved, and there were no other adverse reactions except grade 1 nausea. During this period, chemotherapy and Anlotinib was given concurrently with pirfenidone and showed good safety profile. This case report is the first report of pirfenidone in the treatment of CIP, which provides a new idea for the clinical practice and research of CIP treatment. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1aPD-1\u5355\u6297\u5bfc\u81f4\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u76f8\u5173\u80ba\u708e\u20291\u4f8b\u2014\u2014\u5421\u975e\u5c3c\u916e\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u76f8\u5173\u80ba\u708e\uff08checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis, CIP\uff09\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u526f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6025\u6027\u671f\u6cbb\u7597\u624b\u6bb5\u5df2\u6709\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u6025\u6027\u671f\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u80ba\u95f4\u8d28\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u624b\u6bb5\u4ecd\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9752\u5c9b\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533b\u9662\u7acb\u4f53\u5b9a\u5411\u653e\u7597\u79d1\u6536\u6cbb\u76841\u4f8b\u7ec6\u80de\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6b7b\u4ea1\u53d7\u4f531\uff08programmed cell death1, PD-1\uff09\u5355\u6297\u5bfc\u81f4\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u76f8\u5173\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u6587\u732e\u590d\u4e60\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u60a3\u8005\u7537\u6027\uff0c70\u5c81\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u8bca\u65ad\uff1a\u5de6\u80ba\u4f4e\u5206\u5316\u9cde\u764cT3N3M0 IIIc\u671f\u7eb5\u9694\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u8f6c\u79fb\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff08epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR\uff09/\u95f4\u53d8\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7624\u6fc0\u9176\uff08anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK\uff09/\u539f\u764c\u57fa\u56e01\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\uff08C-ros oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase, ROS1\uff09/RAF\u9634\u6027PD-L1\uff0822C3\uff09\u9634\u6027\u3002\u4e00\u7ebf\u5316\u7597\u8fdb\u5c55\u540e\u7eb3\u6b66\u5229\u5c24\u5355\u6297\u5355\u836f\u4e8c\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u786e\u8bca\u4e3a\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u76f8\u5173\u80ba\u708e3\u7ea7\u3002\u521d\u59cb\u5927\u5242\u91cf\u7cd6\u76ae\u8d28\u6fc0\u7d20\u51b2\u51fb\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u60a3\u8005\u80ba\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08computed tomography, CT\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u7ed9\u4e88\u5421\u975e\u5c3c\u916e\u53e3\u670d\uff08300 mg tid\uff0911\u4e2a\u6708\u4f59\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005CT\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\u660e\u663e\u597d\u8f6c\uff0c\u96641\u7ea7\u6076\u5fc3\u5916\u65e0\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u671f\u95f4\u5421\u975e\u5c3c\u916e\u4e0e\u5316\u7597\u3001\u5b89\u7f57\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u597d\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u672c\u75c5\u4f8b\u62a5\u9053\u4e3a\u76ee\u524d\u5421\u975e\u5c3c\u916e\u6cbb\u7597CIP\u7684\u7b2c1\u4f8b\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4e3aCIP\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\uff1b\u80ba\u708e\uff1bPD-1\u5355\u6297\uff1b\u5421\u975e\u5c3c\u916e\uff1b\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\u3011.",

This study aimed to assess the effect of nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel versus nivolumab monotherapy in patients with NSCLC after the failure of platinum doublet chemotherapy. The efficacy and toxicity of nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel combination therapy versus nivolumab monotherapy were compared in this retrospective study. Primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Between November 2017 and December 2019, 77 patients were included in this study, with 58 patients in the nivolumab group and 19 in the nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel group. The median follow-up was 18\u00a0months, and the PFS was 8\u00a0months for patients receiving nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel and 2\u00a0months for those receiving nivolumab alone (p\u2009=\u20090.001), respectively. Nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel showed superior OS compared with nivolumab, with the median OS unreached versus 7\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.011). Among patients without EGFR/ALK variation, compared to nivolumab monotherapy, nivolumab\u2009+\u2009docetaxel showed better PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and OS (p \u2009=\u20090.05). There was no significant difference in grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) between the two groups (p\u2009=\u20090.253). The combination of nivolumab and docetaxel demonstrated a meaningful improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to nivolumab monotherapy, in patients with NSCLC after the failure of platinum doublet chemotherapy, irrespective of EGFR/ALK variation status.",

    "abstract": "Although PD-(L)1 inhibitors have shown efficacy in advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients do not respond to this treatment and more effective combinations with acceptable toxicities are needed. To assess the potential benefit of combining localized innate immune stimulation with checkpoint blockade, the TLR9 agonist DV281 was combined with nivolumab in a phase Ib study. Patients after one or two prior lines of systemic therapy were enrolled in a dose-escalation study with a 3+3 design. DV281 was administered via inhalation in five dose cohorts at 1 to 25 mg; nivolumab 240 mg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and response to treatment were assessed. Twenty-six patients with advanced NSCLC enrolled. Baseline programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was present in 16 patients (61.5%); 21 (80.7%) had received previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Thirteen patients (50%) had stable disease, nine (34.6%) had progressive disease, and four (15.4%) were not evaluable. Median duration of disease control was 124 days. Adverse events were seen in 16 patients (61.5%), mostly grade 1/2 chills, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and rash; there was only one grade 3 adverse event (dyspnea). Pharmacodynamic assessment, measured by IFN- inducible gene expression, showed target engagement in all dose cohorts. Systemic pharmacodynamic responses plateaued in the 2 highest dose cohorts. DV281 with nivolumab was well tolerated with target engagement observed at every dose. Pharmacodynamic advantages at doses above 10 mg were unclear. The long duration of disease control in 50% of patients suggests clinically relevant activity in this population of heavily pretreated patients.",

    "abstract": "Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved survival for advanced wild-type non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a lack of direct comparisons of various first-line treatments is clouding clinical decision-making. A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare current first-line treatments and identify the optimal regimen for patients with specific characteristics. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials databases were searched from inception to 31 July 2020. Phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing first-line treatments including chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis, ICIs, and their combinations for previously untreated stage IIIB/IV or recurrent driver-gene wild-type NSCLC patients were included. Twenty-six RCTs were identified and included, involving 16,977 patients and a total of 18 regimens. ICI-containing treatments led to significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with ICI-free treatments (0.82, 0.72-0.93). ICI plus chemotherapy had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS; 0.70, 0.58-0.86) and marginally longer OS (0.90, 0.79-1.05) compared with ICIs alone. Ranking highest in the Bayesian network meta-analysis, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy, had significantly superior OS than standard chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab treatments. Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy ranked first for OS, 1-year OS rate, and subgroups of non-squamous, PD-L1\u2009\u2a7e1%, non-smoking, and liver metastasis; while nivolumab-ipilimumab-chemotherapy for squamous, PD-L1\u2009<1%, brain metastasis NSCLC. Furthermore, the ICI-containing bevacizumab-free treatments, such as pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without chemotherapy, were not significantly different from atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and bevacizumab in OS. A combination of ICIs with chemotherapy, rather than double ICIs, is the best first-line treatment for advanced wild-type NSCLC, with synergy that leads to better long-term survival. The panoramic view of the relative efficacy of any two regimens with different rankings provides strong evidence for selecting optimal first-line ICIs according to patients' clinical characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy substantially extends life expectancy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Its cost-effectiveness (CE) was previously evaluated based on interim trial analyses (follow-up \u223c1\u2009year). The present analysis describes CE incorporating additional follow-up based on protocol-specified final trial analyses (1-1.5\u2009years additional follow-up), from a US healthcare payer perspective. A partitioned survival model is used to compare pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy vs chemotherapy using data from the KN189 (non-squamous patients) and KN407 (squamous patients) clinical trials. An indirect treatment comparison vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is made for patient subgroups with PD-L1 TPS \u226550% and 1-49% based on data from the KN024 and KN042 trials. Efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from trials and projected over 20\u2009years. Costs for drugs, non-drug disease management, and adverse events are also incorporated. Overall, versus chemotherapy alone, pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.12\u2009years (3.35 vs 2.23) and 0.67\u2009years (3.17 vs 2.50) in non-squamous and squamous patients, respectively. Resultant ICERs ($158,030/QALY and $178,387/QALY) are below a US 3-times GDP per capita threshold ($195,000/QALY). ICERs vs chemotherapy also generally fall below the threshold within PD-L1 sub-groups (except in squamous PD-L1\u2009<\u20091%, which may have differed due to small sample size) while ICERs vs pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% and 1-49% sub-groups generally exceed it (except in squamous PD-L1 1-49%); largely a result of the higher drug acquisition cost of pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy relative to differences in life expectancy. Taken together, with longer-term trial follow-up and in the context of prior literature, in the US, one of the two options for pembrolizumab use (either pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy), represents a cost-effective treatment in virtually all non-squamous and squamous metastatic NSCLC patient populations and PD-L1 sub-groups evaluated.",

    "title": "TMB or not TMB as a biomarker: That is the question.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the landscape of therapeutic options for many cancers. These treatments have demonstrated improved efficacy and often a more favourable toxicity profile compared to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are considerable differences among responders, with some patients experiencing durable long-term disease control and even remission. Given this variability, determining a proper biomarker to select patients for ICI therapy has become increasingly important. The only biomarker proven to be predictive of overall survival benefit with ICI therapy is PD-L1 expression level measured by immunohistochemistry. Several attempts have been made to identify different predictive biomarkers. One of the most intriguing and divisive is tumor mutational burden (TMB). TMB represents the number of mutations per megabase (Mut/Mb) of DNA that were sequenced in a specific cancer. With a higher number of mutations detected, and consequentially an increase in the number neo-epitopes, then it is more likely that one or more of those neo-antigens could be immunogenic and trigger a T cell response. Initially, TMB was identified as a biomarker for ICIs in melanoma and subsequent studies suggested a possible clinical role for TMB in non-small cell lung cancer. The initial data were not confirmed in a prospective study assessing OS as the primary endpoint. Recently, the FDA has approved pembrolizumab in all cancers with a TMB > 10Mut/Mb[12] based on findings from the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158. Much criticism has emerged about this pan-cancer approval, in particular about the use of TMB as biomarker to select patients. Here we review the data about the importance and role of TMB as possible pan-cancer one-size-fits-all biomarker. We highlight the strengths and intrinsic limitations of such a complex biomarker and its adoption in the daily practice.",

To evaluate treatment outcomes and safety of pembrolizumab plus cCRT in stage III NSCLC. The phase 2, nonrandomized, 2-cohort, open-label KEYNOTE-799 study enrolled patients between November 5, 2018, and July 31, 2020, from 52 academic facilities and community-based institutions across 10 countries. As of October 28, 2020, median (range) follow-up was 18.5 (13.6-23.8) months in cohort A and 13.7 (2.9-23.5) months in cohort B. Of 301 patients screened, 216 eligible patients with previously untreated, unresectable, and pathologically/radiologically confirmed stage IIIA/IIIB/IIIC NSCLC with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) were enrolled. Patients in cohort A (squamous/nonsquamous) received 1 cycle (3 weeks) of carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 6 mg/mL/min), paclitaxel (200 mg/m2), and pembrolizumab (200 mg), followed by carboplatin (AUC 2 mg/mL/min) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) once weekly for 6 weeks and 2 cycles of pembrolizumab plus standard thoracic radiotherapy. Patients in cohort B (nonsquamous) received 3 cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), and pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks and thoracic radiotherapy in cycles 2 and 3. Patients received 14 additional cycles of pembrolizumab. Coprimary end points were objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review and incidence of grade 3 to 5 pneumonitis. A total of 112 patients received treatment in cohort A (76 men [67.9%]; median [range] age, 66.0 [46-90] years; 66 patients [58.9%] with programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] tumor proportion score \u22651%) and 102 patients received treatment in cohort B (62 men [60.8%]; median [range] age, 64.0 [35-81] years; 40 patients [39.2%] with PD-L1 tumor proportion score \u22651%). Objective response rate was 70.5% (79 of 112; 95% CI, 61.2%-78.8%) in cohort A and 70.6% (72 of 102; 95% CI, 60.7%-79.2%) in cohort B. Median duration of response was not reached, but 79.7% and 75.6%, respectively, had response duration of 12 months or longer. Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis occurred in 9 of 112 patients (8.0%) in cohort A and 7 of 102 (6.9%) in cohort B. Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 72 of 112 (64.3%) and 51 of 102 (50.0%) patients, respectively.

However, its efficacy to treat central nervous system (CNS) metastases, specifically among programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative patients, remains unclear. A 66-year-old woman was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma stage II and underwent a left lower lobectomy. The histopathological evaluation revealed stage IVA with pleural dissemination. The patient did not harbor an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement, and PD-L1 expression of the surgical specimen using 22C3 assay was 0%. Single brain metastasis was detected, and carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel were administered. After three\u00a0cycles, asymptomatic multiple brain metastases were identified, and the patient was treated with nivolumab as second-line chemotherapy. Six months later, MRI revealed an intracranial complete response (CR). Nivolumab was discontinued after 23\u2009cycles due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of grade 2 rash. However, its effects were sustained for 13\u2009months after discontinuation. We were unable to evaluate the PD-L1 expression of brain metastases, which may show heterogeneity. This case demonstrates that nivolumab effectively treated a patient with negative PD-L1 expression of the lung harboring CNS metastases.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for most new diagnoses of lung cancer, with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has transformed the treatment of metastatic and advanced NSCLC. For resectable NSCLC, while surgery is the cornerstone of standard treatment, a number of clinical trials of neoadjuvant immunotherapy have been conducted. To perform a systematic review on the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant ICI therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC. This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We undertook a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and abstracts and posters from annual meetings of the major oncology societies, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) up until 29 April 2021. A total of 399 patients were identified from six articles and four meeting abstracts. 229, 140, and 30 patients received anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy (anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab and durvalumab), anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy (anti-PD-1, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, sintilimab), and anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab), respectively. 255 patients received only ICI therapy before surgery, and 144 patients received ICI and chemotherapy. While ICI therapy was generally well tolerated, grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events were observed in 13 of 144 patients (9.0%) in the five studies that reported such adverse events data. Patients displayed an overall mean surgical resection rate of 87.5% (349/399, range, 66.7-100%), a surgical delay rate of 1.4%, and an incidence of surgical complications of 21%. On average, 45.6% (159/349), (range 17-83%) of patients exhibited major pathological response (MPR), while 76/349 (21.8%) patients achieved pathological complete response (pCR). In the studies with patients undergoing ICI and chemotherapy, the MPR rate was 66.7% and pCR rate was 35.4%. ICI neoadjuvant therapy may be a safe and efficacious treatment option in patients with resectable NSCLC. Combined with chemotherapy, ICI appears to be more efficacious, but displays more adverse events. More ongoing clinical trials will shed further light on the safety and efficacy of ICI neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable NSCLC.",

We explored whether combining TMB with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and pretreatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was associated with improved outcomes in ICI-treated NSCLC. We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with ICI with Foundation One genomic testing, including TMB. Optimal cutoff for prediction of response by TMB was determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for all 3 biomarkers and combinations. Cox model was used to assess prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). Survival cutoffs calculated with Kaplan-Meier survival curves were TMB \u226510 mut/Mb, PD-L1 \u226550%, NLR <5, and combined biomarkers. Data from 88 patients treated were analyzed. The optimal TMB cutoff was 9.24 mut/Mb (AUC, 0.62), improving to 0.74 combining all 3 biomarkers. Adjusted Cox model showed that TMB \u226510 mut/Mb was an independent factor of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval; 0.14-0.69; P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and TTP (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003). The combination of high TMB with positive PD-L1 and low NLR was significantly associated with OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.038) but not TTP.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have changed the first-line treatment of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single-agent pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression \u2265 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD-L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic antibody) in first-line NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination of first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD-L1 expression \u22651%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best-treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. To determine the effectiveness and safety of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD-L1 expression. We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first-line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single- or double-ICI treatment to standard first-line therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab). All data come from 'international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically-confirmed stage IV NSCLC. Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta-analyses where appropriate using the random-effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I\u00b2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity. Main results We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first-line single- (six trials) or double- (two trials) agent ICI with platinum-based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first-line single- and double-agent ICsI with platinum-based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate-to-low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD-L1 expressions, with PD-L1 \u2265 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut-off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL-1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD-L1 \u2265 50. Single-agent ICI In the PD-L1 expression \u2265 50% group single-agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). In this group, single-agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low-certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low-certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD-L1 expression \u2265 50%, which suggested that single-agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low-certainty evidence). In the included studies, treatment-related AEs were not reported according to PD-L1 expression levels. Grade 3-4 AEs may be less frequent with single-agent ICI compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I\u00b2 = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low-certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of single-agent ICI compared to platinum-based chemotherapy according to the level of PD-L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. Double-agent ICI Double-ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in people with PD-L1 expression \u226550% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD-L1 groups. Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD-L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3-4 AEs may not differ between double-ICI treatment and platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I\u00b2 = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low-certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of double-agent ICI according to the level of PD-L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review suggests that single-agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD-L1 \u226550% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression-free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD-L1 \u226550% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression-free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Even patients after standard surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy still have a high risk of recurrence and metastasis. With the success of immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the application of immunotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC has being investigated to reduce the recurrence and metastasis. Pre-clinical studies and several phase II clinical studies had provided theoretical support and clinical evidence for neoadjuvant immunotherapy for NSCLC. This review describes the mechanism of neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy, summarizes up-to-date clinical studies, and analyzes efficiency and feasibility of neoadjuvant immune monotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy. Results from four studies (NCT02259621, NEOSTAR, LCMC3 and ChiCTR-OIC-17013726) showed efficiency and feasibility of neoadjuvant anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy. Neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab achieved higher major pathological response rate than nivolumab monotherapy. However, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab led to more severe adverse events as is seen in the NEOSTAR trial. Results from NCT02716038, SAKK 16/14 and NADIM studies suggest that the pathological response rate of neoadjuvant immune-chemotherapy is higher than neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. This review also elaborates the mechanism of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, and discusses the efficacy evaluation after neoadjuvant immunotherapy.\u2029. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u5316\u7597\u5728NSCLC\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u6807\u51c6\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u590d\u53d1\u3001\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6291\u5236\u5242\u6cbb\u7597\u5728\u665a\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u90e8\u5206II\u671f\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u672c\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u73b0\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u524d\u671f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e2d\u671f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u7bc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u514d\u75ab\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u7597\u5bf9\u6bd4\u514d\u75ab\u8054\u5408\u5316\u7597\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002NCT02259621\u3001NEOSTAR\u3001LCMC3\u53caChiCTR-OIC-17013726\u5206\u522b\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u5e94\u7528\u7eb3\u6b66\u5229\u5c24\u5355\u6297\u3001\u963f\u66ff\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u548c\u4fe1\u8fea\u5229\u5355\u6297\u5355\u836f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6NEOSTAR\u53cc\u836f\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u53cc\u836f\u514d\u75ab\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u836f\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff0c\u53cc\u836f\u514d\u75ab\u7684\u9ad8\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e5f\u5f15\u8d77\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002NCT02716038\u3001SAKK 16/14\u548cNADIM\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u793a\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u514d\u75ab\u8054\u5408\u5316\u7597\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u5355\u836f\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u5242\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u53ef\u8010\u53d7\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5316\u7597\u8054\u5408\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u5242\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c31\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u7684\u7597\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\uff1b\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\uff1b\u7efc\u8ff0\u3011.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care in the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, only a small proportion of patients benefit from ICIs. The aim of the present study is to assess whether 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT)-derived parameters may be used as biomarkers in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first-line pembrolizumab. This is a monocentric retrospective cohort study including patients with advanced NSCLC (stage IV) and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u226550% treated with pembrolizumab. A control group of patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for EGFR-mutated NSCLC was also enrolled. Only patients with a positive [18F]18F-FDG PET/CT result within 60 days from treatment initiation were included.Total metabolic tumour volume (tMTV) was calculated for each lesion using a dedicated software (PET VCAR; GE Healthcare), which semiautomatically delineates the tumour's contours with a maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) threshold of 42% within the lesion. tMTV was obtained summing each lesion's MTV. Potential prognostic parameters for overall survival (OS) were analysed (tMTV, SUVmax, bone/liver metastasis, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio\u00a0\u22654, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status\u00a0\u22652, lactate dehydrogenase\u00a0above the upper limit of normal). Overall, 34 patients treated with first line-pembrolizumab and 40 patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors were included. In the pembrolizumab group, the median follow-up was 20.3, while the median OS was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.3-9.1) for patients with tMTV\u00a0\u226575\u00a0cm Our data suggest\u00a0that tMTV \u226575cm",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment, the incidence and characteristics of pneumonitis caused by this combination therapy have not been examined in clinical settings. We conducted a 36-centre, retrospective cohort study in patients with chemo-na\u00efve advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who received a combination of platinum, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab between December 2018 and June 2019. The study comprised 299 patients. The most frequent grade \u22653 non-hematologic adverse event was pneumonitis. There were 37 patients (12.4%, 95% CI 8.9-16.7) with all-grade pneumonitis and 10 (3.3%, 95% CI 1.6-6.1) with grade \u22653 pneumonitis. Of these, 21 (7.0%, 95% CI 4.4-10.5) and 9 patients (3.0%, 95% CI 1.4-5.6) developed all-grade and grade \u22653 pneumonitis within 90 days after initiating the combination therapy, respectively. The median time to treatment failure and progression-free survival was 5.9 (95% CI 5.0-6.8) and 7.5 (95% CI 6.5-8.7) months, respectively. In the survival analysis after adjusting for immortal time bias, pneumonitis was independently associated with shorter progression-free survival (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.07-3.69, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and overall survival (HR 3.03, 95% CI 1.12-8.20, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Treatment-related pneumonitis occurred at a higher rate in the real-world population than that reported previously; it led to worse survival outcomes. Pneumonitis requires more attention. Additional studies are required to improve the safety of this combination therapy. UMIN000038084.",

The purpose of this study was to conduct a network meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy of these immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We used Bayesian network meta-analysis methods to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the included treatments. We further analyzed subgroups based on PD-L1 expression level, histology type, and line of the treatment setting. We identified 19 RCTs, including 12,753 patients. In the analysis of all-comers, the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy combination ranked best for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Durvalumab was the only ICI treatment that showed no benefit over chemotherapy. In the first-line setting only, in terms of OS, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, and nivolumab/ipilimumab ranked as the best treatments for patients with PD-L1 expression levels of \u226550%, 1-49%, and <1%, respectively. Nivolumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab all had lower odds of grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) compared to chemotherapy. With the addition of chemotherapy to any ICI regimen, the odds of TRAEs increased in a considerable and statistically significant way. While the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy combination was the most effective therapy in the overall cohort of all-comers, treatment preferences varied by treatment-line setting, tumor characteristics, and outcome of interest. In the first-line setting, the most effective treatments for patients with PD-L1 expressions of \u226550%, 1-49%, and <1% were atezolizumab, pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, and nivolumab/ipilimumab, respectively.",

KEYNOTE-024 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02142738) is an open-label, randomized controlled trial of pembrolizumab compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated NSCLC with a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score of at least 50% and no sensitizing  Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab (200 mg once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles) or platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients in the chemotherapy group with progressive disease could cross over to pembrolizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival; OS was a secondary end point. Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned: 154 to pembrolizumab and 151 to chemotherapy. Median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff (June 1, 2020) was 59.9 (55.1-68.4) months. Among patients initially assigned to chemotherapy, 99 received subsequent anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy, representing a 66.0% effective crossover rate. Median OS was 26.3 months (95% CI, 18.3 to 40.4) for pembrolizumab and 13.4 months (9.4-18.3) for chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5-year OS rate were 31.9% for the pembrolizumab group and 16.3% for the chemotherapy group. Thirty-nine patients received 35 cycles (ie, approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, 82.1% of whom were still alive at data cutoff (approximately 5 years). Toxicity did not increase with longer treatment exposure. Pembrolizumab provides a durable, clinically meaningful long-term OS benefit versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of at least 50%.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), has become an integral part of front-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, pivotal trials had significant underrepresentation of Black patients (pts). Lack of sufficient evidence regarding safety and efficacy of ICIs among minority racial groups poses a challenge in delivery of optimal cancer directed care. We retrospectively reviewed pts with stage IV NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab across three MedStar facilities between January 1, 2014, and May 3, 2019. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were primary endpoints and were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). In total, 136 pts were identified, with 74 (54.4%) White, 53 (39%) Black, 2 (1.5%) Asian, and 7 (5.1%) other racial groups. Median age was 70\u2009years in White pts and 65\u2009years in Black pts (p < .01). There was no difference in median PFS (5.7 vs. 5.9 months; p = .651) or OS (11.8 vs. 12.4 months; p = .949) between White and Black pts. In the subset of patients whose tumors had high programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (\u226550%), there was still no difference in efficacy by race. Median PFS (8.7 vs. 3.9 months; p = .843) and OS (14.7 vs. 11.3 months; p = .581) in White versus Black pts were not different. Incidence of irAEs in White versus Black pts was 24.3% and 22.6%, respectively (p = .83). We found no major differences in either safety or efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab between White and Black pts. Use of first-line pembrolizumab-based treatment in Black pts with stage IV NSCLC is safe and efficacious, based on these real-world data. Immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. There are certain populations of patients underrepresented in the original trials including minority racial groups, patients with autoimmune diseases, and those with chronic viral illnesses. Our study focuses on Black patients with metastatic lung cancer who received pembrolizumab and concludes similar safety and response to treatment when compared with White patients. Black patients are an important demographic group in clinical practice often facing systemic health care disparities. This study paves a path for future studies in underrepresented populations receiving immunotherapy across various malignancies.",

We performed a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis by retrieving relevant literature from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and\u00a0major international conferences. We included published and gray sources of randomized clinical trials comparing immunotherapy combinations with other treatments as first-line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC. This\u00a0study was registered in the Prospective Register of\u00a0Systematic Reviews (CRD42020210501) to ensure transparency. We analyzed a total of 16 studies involving 8278 patients and including 10 immunotherapy combinations. For patients without programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) selection, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was found to be comparable with sintilimab plus chemotherapy in providing the best overall survival (OS) benefit (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-1.29). Furthermore, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy seemed to provide the best progression-free survival (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.45, 95% CI: 0.36-0.55) and the best objective response rate (OR\u00a0= 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.42). Subgroup analysis by PD-L1 suggested that nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was associated with the best OS in patients with PD-L1 less than 1% and that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was associated with the best OS in patients with PD-L1 greater than or equal to 1%. Pembrolizumab and sintilimab were associated with relatively fewer grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse events when compared with other immunotherapies combined with chemotherapy. Our results suggest that antiprogrammed death-1 combinations are associated with potentially higher survival outcomes than anti-PD-L1 combinations with comparable safety profiles. Moreover, pem-chemo and nivo-ipi-chemo seem to be superior first-line immunotherapy combinations for patients with advanced NSCLC with positive and negative PD-L1 expression, respectively. Although atezo-beva-chemo treatment provided the best progression-free survival and objective response rate, the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy would increase the toxicity, especially when antiangiogenesis drugs are simultaneously added.",

    "title": "Prognostic impact of KRAS mutation status for patients with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Monotherapy with pembrolizumab is the preferred first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u226550 %, without targetable oncogenic drivers. Although targeted therapies are in development for patients with specific Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutations, these are not available in daily care yet. It is not clear whether there is a difference in survival on first-line pembrolizumab for patients with a high PD-L1 status with or without a KRAS mutation. We aim to compare this survival based on real-world data. This is a real-world retrospective population-based study using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We selected patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with PD-L1 expression \u226550 % diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2018, treated with first-line pembrolizumab. Patients with EGFR mutations, ALK translocations or ROS1 rearrangements were excluded. The primary outcome parameter was overall survival. 388 (57 %) of 595 patients had a KRAS mutation. KRAS was seen more frequently in women than in men (65 % versus 49 % respectively, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The median overall survival was 19.2 months versus 16.8 months for patients with and without KRAS mutation, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.86). Multivariable analysis revealed WHO performance score, number of organs with metastases and PD-L1 percentage as independent prognostic factors. KRAS mutation status had no prognostic influence (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f1.03, 95 % CI 0.83-1.29). The survival of KRAS mutated versus KRAS wild-type lung adenocarcinoma patients, treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy, is similar, suggesting that KRAS has no prognostic value with respect to treatment with pembrolizumab.",

    "title": "The influence of STK11 mutation on acquired resistance to immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with Lynch syndrome: a case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) monotherapy or combination therapies have become increasingly popular in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there are still many unknowns concerning the predictive bio-markers and resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy. Patients with primary tumor STK11 mutation reportedly to have a lower response rate than the STK11 wild-type and possibly a primary resistance mechanism to ICIs. However, there is presently no data regarding the contribution of STK11 to acquired resistance to ICIs. Herein we report on a patient who was diagnosed with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by Lynch syndrome. The patient developed an STK11 mutation after receiving pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was highly expressed (50%) in the biopsy. HRAS Q61L and TP53 R158L were mainly detected. Unexpectedly, the patient carried an MSH6 heterozygous germline mutation, and was classified as proficient mismatch repair (pMMR). The patient subsequently received pembrolizumab (200 mg, ivgtt, q3w) as first line therapy and achieved stable disease (SD) as the best response. After eight treatment cycles, the patient suffered disease progression (PD), and an STK11 frameshift mutation was newly identified in his plasma circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA). This case study suggests that STK11 could contribute to pembrolizumab acquired resistance. Furthermore, the patient was also diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, which rarely occurs in lung cancer.",

    "title": "Analysis of Real-World Data to Investigate the Impact of Race and Ethnicity on Response to Programmed Cell Death-1 and Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 Inhibitors in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers.",
    "abstract": "Racial disparities among clinical trial participants present a challenge to assess whether trial results can be generalized into patients representing diverse races and ethnicities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of race and ethnicity on treatment response in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) treated with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors through analysis of real-world data (RWD). A retrospective cohort study of 11,138 patients with lung cancer treated at hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System was performed. Patients with confirmed aNSCLC who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment were analyzed for clinical outcomes. Our cohort included 249 patients with aNSCLC who began nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab treatment between November 2014 and December 2018. Time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) were the analyzed clinical endpoints. After a median follow-up of 14.8 months, median TTD was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval, 5.4-not estimable [NE]) in 75 African American patients versus 4.6 (2.4-7.2) in 110 White patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63). Median OS was not reached (18.4-NE) in African American patients versus 11.6 months (9.7-NE) in White patients (HR, 0.58). Multivariable Cox regression conducted with potential confounders confirmed longer TTD (adjusted HR, 0.65) and OS (adjusted HR, 0.60) in African American versus White patients. Similar real-world response rate (42.6% vs. 43.5%) and disease control rate (59.6% vs. 56.5%) were observed in the African American and White patient populations. Further investigation revealed the African American patient group had lower incidence (14.7%) of putative hyperprogressive diseases (HPD) upon anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment than the White patient group (24.5%). Analysis of RWD showed longer TTD and OS in African American patients with aNSCLC treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Lower incidence of putative HPD is a possible reason for the favorable outcomes in this patient population. There is a significant underrepresentation of minority patients in randomized clinical trials, and this study demonstrates that real-world data can be used to investigate the impact of race and ethnicity on treatment response. In retrospective analysis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with programmed cell death-1 or programmed cell death-ligand 1 inhibitors, African American patients had significantly longer time-to-treatment discontinuation and longer overall survival. Analysis of real-world data can yield clinical insights and establish a more complete picture of medical interventions in routine clinical practice.",

    "title": "Differential influence of antibiotic therapy and other medications on oncological outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line pembrolizumab versus cytotoxic chemotherapy.",
    "abstract": "Some concomitant medications including antibiotics (ATB) have been reproducibly associated with worse survival following immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in unselected patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (according to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and treatment line). Whether such relationship is causative or associative is matter of debate. We present the outcomes analysis according to concomitant baseline medications (prior to ICI initiation) with putative immune-modulatory effects in a large cohort of patients with metastatic NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression \u226550%, receiving first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. We also evaluated a control cohort of patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with first-line chemotherapy. The interaction between key medications and therapeutic modality (pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy) was validated in pooled multivariable analyses. 950 and 595 patients were included in the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy cohorts, respectively. Corticosteroid and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy but not ATB therapy was associated with poorer performance status at baseline in both the cohorts. No association with clinical outcomes was found according to baseline statin, aspirin, \u03b2-blocker and metformin within the pembrolizumab cohort. On the multivariable analysis, ATB emerged as a strong predictor of worse overall survival (OS) (HR=1.42 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.79); p=0.0024), and progression free survival (PFS) (HR=1.29 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.59); p=0.0192) in the pembrolizumab but not in the chemotherapy cohort. Corticosteroids were associated with shorter PFS (HR=1.69 (95%\u2009CI 1.42 to 2.03); p<0.0001), and OS (HR=1.93 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.35); p<0.0001) following pembrolizumab, and shorter PFS (HR=1.30 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.56), p=0.0046) and OS (HR=1.58 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.94), p<0.0001), following chemotherapy. PPIs were associated with worse OS (HR=1.49 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.77); p<0.0001) with pembrolizumab and shorter OS (HR=1.12 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.24), p=0.0139), with chemotherapy. At the pooled analysis, there was a statistically significant interaction with treatment (pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy) for corticosteroids (p=0.0020) and PPIs (p=0.0460) with respect to OS, for corticosteroids (p<0.0001), ATB (p=0.0290), and PPIs (p=0.0487) with respect to PFS, and only corticosteroids (p=0.0033) with respect to objective response rate. In this study, we validate the significant negative impact of ATB on pembrolizumab monotherapy but not chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC, producing further evidence about their underlying immune-modulatory effect. Even though the magnitude of the impact of corticosteroids and PPIs is significantly different across the cohorts, their effects might be driven by adverse disease features.",

    "title": "[Effect of Pembrolizumab on T Lymphocyte Subsets in Patients with Advanced \u2029Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Its Therapeutic Effect].",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets before and after treatment with pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer and its clinical significance. A total of 32 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received pembrolizumab treatment in The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University and Weifang People's Hospital of Shandong Province from January 2015 to December 2020 were selected as the observation group, and 30 healthy people during the same period were selected as the control group. Before treatment and in cycles 1, 2 and 4 after treatment, fluid cytometry was used to detect changes in the levels of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients. The CD3\u207a, CD4\u207a, CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a indexes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer before the treatment were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), and the CD8\u207a level was significantly increased (P<0.05); After 1 cycle of pembrolizumab treatment, there was no significant difference in the changes of lymphocyte subsets compared with before immunotherapy; After 2 cycles of the treatment, the CD3\u207a, CD4\u207a, CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a values were higher than before the treatment (P>0.05), and the CD8\u207a index was slightly lower than before the treatment (P<0.05); After the fourth cycle of treatment, the CD3\u207a, CD4\u207a, CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a values were significantly improved compared to before the treatment (P<0.05), and the CD8\u207a index was significantly lower than before the treatment (P<0.05); In the treatment process of patients with stable disease (SD)/partial response (PR), the CD3\u207a, CD4\u207a, CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a values of the fourth cycles were higher than before the treatment (P<0.05), and the CD8\u207a index was lower than before the treatment (P<0.05); During the treatment of progressive disease (PD) patients, the changes of lymphocyte subsets in the fourth cycles were not significantly different from those before the treatment (P>0.05). At the same time, this article shows through analysis that the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and pathological types have no obvious influence on the effect of immunotherapy. Multi-factor analysis shows that it is more meaningful to observe the changes of CD3\u207a, CD4\u207a and CD8\u207a at the same time to predict the effect of immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab can regulate the changes of T lymphocyte subsets in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, improve the immune status of the patients, and there is no obvious adverse reaction. At the same time, monitoring the changes of lymphocyte subsets during treatment can predict the effect of immunotherapy. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u5bf9\u665a\u671f\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u2029T\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u7597\u6548\u89c2\u6d4b\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u5e94\u7528\u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u540e\u5916\u5468\u8840\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u9009\u53d62015\u5e741\u6708-2020\u5e7412\u6708\u81f3\u9752\u5c9b\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u533b\u9662\u53ca\u6f4d\u574a\u5e02\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662\u884c\u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u768432\u4f8b\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec4\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u9009\u53d6\u540c\u671f30\u4f8b\u5065\u5eb7\u67e5\u4f53\u8005\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3002\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u7b2c1\u30012\u30014\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u672f\u68c0\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u5916\u5468\u8840\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u7684CD3\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cCD8\u207a\u6c34\u5e73\u660e\u663e\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u75971\u4e2a\u5468\u671f\u540e\uff0c\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u8f83\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u672a\u89c1\u660e\u663e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6cbb\u75972\u5468\u671f\u540eCD3\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a\u6570\u503c\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P>0.05\uff09\uff0cCD8\u207a\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u4e0b\u964d\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u6cbb\u75974\u5468\u671f\u540eCD3\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a\u6570\u503c\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cCD8\u207a\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u7597\u6548\u8fbe\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08stable disease, SD\uff09/\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff08partial response, PR\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b2c4\u5468\u671f\u7684CD3\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a/CD8\u207a\u6570\u503c\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff0cCD8\u207a\u6307\u6807\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u7597\u6548\u8fbe\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff08progressive disease, PD\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u5747\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6b7b\u4ea1\u53d7\u4f53\u914d\u4f531\uff08programmed cell death ligand 1, PD-L1\uff09\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u5426\u53ca\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdfCD3\u207a\u3001CD4\u207a\u3001CD8\u207a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005T\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u673a\u4f53\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u89c1\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76d1\u6d4b\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u5e15\u535a\u5229\u73e0\u5355\u6297\uff1b\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\uff1bT\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e9a\u7fa4\u3011.",

Pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab are used in clinical practice. The strict eligibility criteria of clinical trials do not allow researchers to fully represent treatment effects in the patients that will ultimately use these drugs. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these drugs, and more generally of ICIs, as second-line therapy in NSCLC patients in real world practice. MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched to include original studies published between January 2015 and April 2020. A total of 32 studies was included in the meta-analysis. The overall radiological response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 21%, 52%, 3.35 months and 9.98 months, respectively. The results did not change when analysis was adjusted for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) and age.

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies around the world. Due to the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, most patients require systemic treatment. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors is becoming the main treatment method for many cancers, including NSCLC. Numerous studies have shown greater efficacy of immunotherapy used monoclonal antibodies anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab and durvalumab) compared to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, cancer cells can develop a number of mechanisms to escape from immune surveillance, including avoidance of cancer cells by the immune system (immune desert), production of immunosuppressive compounds (prostaglandins, IDO, TGF-beta), or direct immune checkpoints interactions. Therapy based on the use of radiochemotherapy with subsequent immunotherapy is becoming the main focus of research in the field of new NSCLC therapies. Radiation therapy stimulates the immune response multidirectionally, affects production of neoantigens and proinflammatory compounds, which transform non-immunogenic (\"cold\") tumors into highly immunogenic (\"hot\") tumors. As a result, the mechanisms of escape of cancer cells from immune surveillance break down and the effectiveness of immunotherapy increases significantly. The results of clinical trials in this area bring new hope and indicate greater effectiveness of such treatment in terms of prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival.",

    "abstract": "Despite the wide-spread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer chemotherapy, reports on patients developing acquired resistance (AR) to ICI therapy are scarce. Therefore, we first investigated the characteristics associated with shorter durable responses of ICI treatment and revealed the clinical patterns of AR and prognosis of the patients involved. We conducted a retrospective multi-center cohort study that included NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion scores of \u226550% who received first-line pembrolizumab and showed response to the therapy. Among patients showing response, progression-free survival (PFS) was investigated based on different clinically relevant factors. AR was defined as disease progression after partial or complete response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Among patients with AR, patterns of AR and post-progression survival (PPS) were investigated. Oligoprogression was defined as disease progression in up to 5 individual progressive lesions. Among 174 patients who received first-line pembrolizumab, 88 showed response and were included in the study. Among these patients, 46 (52%) developed AR. Patients with old age, poor performance status (PS), at least 3 metastatic organs, or bone metastasis showed significantly shorter PFS. Among 46 patients with AR, 32 (70%) developed AR as oligoprogression and showed significantly longer PPS than those with non-oligoprogressive AR. Patients with old age, poor PS, at least 3 metastatic organs, or bone metastasis showed shorter durable responses to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Oligoprogressive AR was relatively common and associated with better prognosis. Further research is required to develop optimal approaches for the treatment of these patients.",

    "abstract": "The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis is vital for immune resistance during tumor development, while PD-L1 inhibitors can also inhibit the PD-L1/B7-1 (CD80) interaction, indicating one of the molecular differences between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. However, the clinical benefits of PD-L1 inhibitors in patients previously treated with PD-1 inhibitors remain unknown. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of eight patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab and previously treated with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. The median progression-free survival was 2.1 months (1.8-18.7 months), and 4 of 8 patients achieved at least stable disease. In two of these patients, atezolizumab treatment resulted in longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared with that of nivolumab. Conversely, one patient exhibited grade 4 diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within 2 weeks after the initial administration of atezolizumab. Another patient had developed type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) during the prior nivolumab treatment and then developed DKA due to an infection after the initiation of atezolizumab. Both of them had high-risk human leukocyte antigen-DR/DQ types relevant to T1DM. These results demonstrate the potential efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors to some tumors that have acquired resistance to PD-1 inhibitors and suggest that appropriate managements are required for not only a newly onset of T1DM but also blood glucose control after the development of T1DM during a reiteration of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a history of tobacco use who presented with a central nervous system mass that was confirmed to be a lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. High PD-L1 expression as well as negativity to other targetable drivers led to initiation of pembrolizumab monotherapy and ablative stereotactic radiation therapy on oligo-residual disease, achieving a complete response after 2 years of therapy. Following discontinuation of systemic treatment, the patient developed widespread desquamative plaques. A skin biopsy revealed subepidermal blistering and eosinophilic infiltration in conjunction with C3 and IgG depositions on the basement membrane, detected by immunofluorescence. A diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was obtained, and systemic corticosteroids were administered with lesion progression. Infliximab was also administered without meaningful clinical improvement. Metronomic cyclophosphamide achieved a complete resolution of skin lesions and up to this day the patient continues with tumor control and is free of dermatological findings. In conclusion, bullous pemphigoid is a very rare dermatological adverse effect related with pembrolizumab treatment. Only two cases, including this one, have been reported, especially with this medication for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. With more reported cases, management strategies can be optimized even in the steroid refractory setting.",

    "abstract": "Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have emerged as frontline treatments for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on the basis of global Phase III trials. However, current data regarding responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in older patients with NSCLC or those with poor performance status (PS) are limited. Therefore, we examined the therapeutic effect of anti PD-1 antibody in these patients. We retrospectively examined consecutive patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) from January 2016 to September 2018. We enrolled 125 patients (median age, 60 years), 80.8% of whom were men. Patients aged \u226575 years were considered older patients (n = 15), and those with PS 2-3 were regarded as having poor PS (n = 11). The objective response and disease control rates were 15.4% and 46.2%, respectively, in older patients and 9.1% and 27.3%, respectively, in those with poor PS. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) did not significantly differ between older and younger patients. However, poor PS was significantly associated with poor survival. High programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor specimens (\u226550%) was associated with favorable survival in the entire cohort as well as patients with poor PS. Safety analyses demonstrated no significant difference in the occurrence of any adverse event, including grade \u22653 adverse events, between patients with poor PS or older age and the remaining patients. Anti-PD-1 therapy had similar efficacy in older and younger patients with NSCLC, whereas survival was significantly worse in patients with poor PS. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors may be considered for patients with poor PS harboring positive PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Treatment strategies for advanced NSCLC patients without driver molecular alterations are influenced by PD-L1 expression. If PD-L1 is <50 %, the preferred upfront treatment is the association of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, while immunotherapy alone is an additional option if PD-L1 \u2265 50 %. Both treatments demonstrated their superiority over chemotherapy in this subset of NSCLC patients, with comparable efficacy outcomes but less safety concerns for immunotherapy alone. Nevertheless, a significant difference in terms of early progression-free survival rate emerges by analyzing and comparing the survival curves of the two strategies, reflecting a non-negligible loss of patients due to early disease progression at 3 and 6 months from treatment initiation with immunotherapy alone as compared to its association with chemotherapy. We deeply analyzed efficacy similarities and differences of the two approaches in advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression \u226550 %, trying to suggest clinical and biologic aspects to be considered when facing the treatment choice.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are two new treatment options for patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high (\u2265\u200950%) programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for Switzerland comparing these two options but also pembrolizumab to chemotherapy. We constructed a 3-state Markov model with a time horizon of 10\u00a0years. Parametric functions were fitted to Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using 2-year follow-up data from the KN-024 and KN-189 registration trials. We included estimated costs for further treatment lines and costs for best supportive care. Costs were assessed from the Swiss healthcare payer perspective. We used published utility values. Combination therapy resulted in an expected gain of 0.17 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and incremental costs of Swiss Francs (CHF)\u00a081,085 as compared to pembrolizumab. These estimates led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CHF\u00a0475,299/QALY. Pembrolizumab in comparison to chemotherapy was estimated to generate mean incremental QALYs of 0.83 and incremental costs of CHF\u00a056,585, resulting in an ICER of CHF\u00a068,580/QALY. Results were most sensitive to changes in costs of 1L pembrolizumab and combination therapy, together with changes in PFS. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated combination therapy was cost-effective in 4.9% of the simulations and pembrolizumab monotherapy in 82.9%, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF\u00a0100,000 per QALY gained. Pembrolizumab is likely to be cost-effective from the Swiss healthcare payer perspective, whereas pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not.",

    "abstract": "To stratify the prognosis of patients with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) \u2265 50% advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) treated with first-line immunotherapy. Baseline clinical prognostic factors, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), PD-L1 tumour cell expression level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and their combination were investigated by a retrospective analysis of 784 patients divided between statistically powered training (n\u00a0= 201) and validation (n\u00a0= 583) cohorts. Cut-offs were explored by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and a risk model built with validated independent factors by multivariate analysis. NLR < 4 was a significant prognostic factor in both cohorts (P < 0.001). It represented 53% of patients in the validation cohort, with 1-year overall survival (OS) of 76.6% versus 44.8% with NLR > 4, in the validation series. The addition of PD-L1 \u2265 80% (21% of patients) or LDH < 252 U/l (25%) to NLR < 4 did not result in better 1-year OS (of 72.6% and 74.1%, respectively, in the validation cohort). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2 [P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) 2.04], pretreatment steroids (P < 0.001, HR 1.67) and NLR < 4 (P < 0.001, HR 2.29) resulted in independent prognostic factors. A risk model with these three factors, namely, the lung immuno-oncology prognostic score (LIPS)-3, accurately stratified three OS risk-validated categories of patients: favourable (0 risk factors, 40%, 1-year OS of 78.2% in the whole series), intermediate (1 or 2 risk factors, 54%, 1-year OS 53.8%) and poor (>2 risk factors, 5%, 1-year OS 10.7%) prognosis.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with brain metastases (BMs) from non-oncogene addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is under investigation. Here, we sought to determine the optimal management of NSCLCs with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% and asymptomatic BMs who were treated with first-line pembrolizumab. Thirty patients from 15 institutions with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% NSCLC had asymptomatic BMs, and met inclusion criteria. Patients were classified based on whether they had undergone upfront local radiotherapy for BMs as well as on the type of brain radiotherapy received. Nine patients were treated with upfront pembrolizumab alone, 8 patients with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) followed by pembrolizumab and 13 patients with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) followed by pembrolizumab. Patients' characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients except for a higher number of BMs\u2009\u2265\u20093 in the WBRT group. One complete and 4 partial intracranial responses were observed with upfront pembrolizumab alone. The median survival was not reached for the pembrolizumab and WBRT (n\u2009=\u20098) groups, and it was 7.6\u00a0months for the SRS (n\u2009=\u200913) group (P\u2009=\u20090.09), with 12-month survival rates being 55.5%, 62.5%, and 23.0%, respectively. Salvage WBRT was delivered in 1 patient in the upfront pembrolizumab group and in 4 patients in the SRS group. Upfront pembrolizumab showed efficacy in selected patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% non-oncogene addicted NSCLC and asymptomatic BMs. Prospective studies should address whether pembrolizumab alone, and deferral of radiotherapy, could be pursued in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Treatment sequencing with first-line immunotherapy, followed by second-line chemotherapy, is still a viable option for NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550%. We evaluated post-progression treatment pathways in a large real-world cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression \u2265 50% treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. Overall, 974 patients were included. With a median follow-up of 22.7 months (95%CI: 21.6-38.2), the median overall survival (OS) of the entire population was 15.8 months (95%CI: 13.5-17.5; 548 events). At the data cutoff, among the 678 patients who experienced disease progression, 379 (55.9%) had not received any further treatment, and 359 patients (52.9%) had died. Patients who did not receive post-progression therapies were older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0011), with a worse ECOG-PS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and were on corticosteroids prior to pembrolizumab (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0024). At disease progression, 198 patients (29.2%) received a switched approach and 101 (14.9%) received pembrolizumab ByPD either alone (64 [9.4%]) or in combination with local ablative treatments (37 [5.5%]) (LATs). After a random-case control matching according to ECOG-PS, CNS metastases, bone metastases, and (previous) best response to pembrolizumab, patients receiving pembrolizumab ByPD plus LATs were confirmed to have a significantly longer post-progression OS compared to patients receiving pembrolizumab ByPD alone 13.9 months versus 7.8 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0179)\u00a0241 patients (35.5%) among the 678 who had experienced PD, received a second-line systemic treatment (regardless of previous treatment beyond PD). As compared to first-line treatment commencement, patients' features at the moment of second-line initiation showed a significantly higher proportion of patients aged under 70 years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0244), with a poorer ECOG-PS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and having CNS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), bone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0266) and liver metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0148). In the real-world scenario NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550% treated with first-line single-agent pembrolizumab\u00a0achieve worse outcomes as compared to the Keynote-024 trial. Poor post-progression outcomes are major determinants of the global results\u00a0that should be considered when counselling patients for first-line treatment choices.",

The inhibition of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) pathways leads to an activation of the immune response against tumor cells. Thanks to a synergistic effect, the combination of the checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab has the potential to improve outcomes of NSCLC patients. We provide an overview of clinical trials evaluating the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, alone or with a few cycles of chemotherapy, was demonstrated to be a valid option for first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients without EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement.

Patient characteristics, PD-L1 expression, line of treatment, response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria), and vital status (May 14, 2020) were recorded. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed, and hazard ratios (HR) estimated. A total of 145 patients were treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab on the basis of PD-L1 expression in EBUS-TBNA (31.7%) or histological (68.3%) samples.

First-line pembrolizumab was administered to 61 patients with tumor proportion score\u00a0\u226550%\u00a0in EBUS-TBNA (n\u00a0= 16) or histology samples (n\u00a0= 45). Median OS and PFS of patients who received first-line pembrolizumab on the basis of PD-L1 results in EBUS-TBNA vs\u00a0histology samples were not significantly different (OS 25.8\u00a0months vs\u00a0not reached, respectively; HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.34-1.95], P\u00a0= .651). Similarly, the median OS and PFS of patients who received subsequent lines of treatment on the basis of PD-L1 results in EBUS-TBNA vs\u00a0histological samples were not significantly different (including after adjustment for PD-L1 expression). These findings suggest that PD-L1 results in EBUS-TBNA samples can guide ICI therapy, with treatment outcomes being comparable to those of patients in whom PD-L1 expression was assessed in histological specimens.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) either alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy has dramatically changed the therapeutic scenario in non-small cell lung cancer. However, only a subset of patients derives clinical benefits. Although programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are known to be prognostic and demonstrated utility in selecting patients for immunotherapy response, they are imperfect biomarkers. Recent evidence demonstrates that AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) deficiency is associated with high antitumor immunity, mismatch repair and TMB, and thus may potentially contribute as a predictive biomarker for ICIs. We herein describe a 60-year-old woman, former smoker, who was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma metastatic to the left adrenal gland, with a PD-L1 expression of 60%. Next-generation sequencing test revealed an ARID1A mutation (F2141fs*59, variant allele frequency\u00a0=\u00a022.5%), TMB of 92 mut/Mb and stable microsatellite status. Given the high PD-L1 expression, elevated TMB, and ARID1A mutation, the patient started on first-line treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy, and, 5 months after initiating treatment, presented an expressive reduction of lung lesion and a complete response of the adrenal gland. This case illustrates a dramatic response to ICI monotherapy in a lung cancer patient with ARID1A mutation. Predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint blockade are of the utmost importance to select the patients who truly benefit from immunotherapy. The combination of biomarkers may be the most effective strategy to improve outcomes with ICIs, and ARID1A status should definitely be taken into account when present.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is a highly effective standard of care in PD-L1 overexpressing (\u2265 50%) non-small-cell lung cancer. However, a substantial share of patients from everyday clinical practice is treated without clear evidence from clinical trials. We performed a retrospective multicentric study including all consecutive patients from 6 certified lung cancer centers in Berlin, Germany, having received pembrolizumab as first-line palliative therapy from January 1 until December 31, 2017. Aims were to validate published clinical trials with a special focus on efficacy and outcome in patients with reduced performance status (PS), brain metastases, and steroids. A total of 153 patients were included (median age 69 years, 58% men, 69% adenocarcinoma). Rates for PS \u2265 2, brain metastases, and steroids were 24.8%, 20.9%, and 24.2%, respectively. Median objective response rate, progression-free and overall survival were 48.5%, 8.2 and 22.0 months for all patients and 52.4%, 8.8 and 29.2 months in patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the KEYNOTE-024 trial. Patients with a comorbidity-defined PS \u2265 2, symptomatic brain metastases requiring upfront radiotherapy, or baseline steroids had significantly reduced survival. In contrast, durable responses occurred with a tumor-related PS \u2265 2 or asymptomatic brain metastases. Grade 3/4 and 5 immune-related adverse events affected 13.7% and 2.0% of patients. Real-world and clinical trial efficacy with upfront pembrolizumab correspond well. Pembrolizumab may sufficiently control asymptomatic brain metastases and may improve a cancer-related reduced PS. However, the frail share of patients with a comorbidity-defined PS \u2265 2, symptomatic brain metastases, or baseline steroids derives no relevant benefit.",

    "abstract": "Expression of PD-L1 protein on tumor cells, which is so far the only validated predictive factor for immunotherapy, is regulated by epigenetic and genetic factors. Among the most important ones that regulate gene expression are microRNAs. The study included 60 patients with NSCLC who underwent first or second line immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. FFPE materials were collected before the start of immunotherapy. We examined relative expression of microRNAs (miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-429, miR-508-3p, miR-1184, miR-1255a) and  Response to immunotherapy was observed in nine patients (15%, including one complete response), disease stabilization in 22 patients (36.7%), and progression in 29\u00a0patients (48.3%). Significantly higher (p=0.015) expression of miR-200b and significantly lower (p=0.043) expression of miR-429 were observed in responders compared to patients who did not respond to immunotherapy. The median PFS in the whole group of patients was 16 weeks, and the median OS was 10.5 month. In univariate analysis, the median PFS was significantly higher in patients with high miR-200b expression (HR=0.4253, 95%CI: 0.1737-1.0417, p=0.05) and high miR-508 expression (HR=0.4401, 95%CI: 0.1903-1.0178, p=0.05) and with low expression of miR-429 (HR=0.1288, 95%CI: 0.01727-0.9606, p=0.0456) compared to patients with low and high expression of these molecules, respectively. The median OS was higher in patients with low expression of miR-429 (HR=0,6288, 95%CI: 0,3053-1,2949, p=0.06) compared with patients with high expression of this microRNA. In multivariate analysis, we found that patients with PD-L1 expression on \u22651% of tumor cells compared to patients without PD-L1 expression on cancer cells had a significantly lower risk of progression (HR=0.3857, 95%CI: 0.1612-0.9226, p=0.0323) and death (HR=0.377, 95%CI: 0.1636-0.8688, p=0.022). The miR-200b and miR-429 molecules in tumor cells seem to have greatest impact on the effectiveness of immunotherapy in NSCLC patients.",

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States and is responsible for more cancer-related deaths than breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer combined. The landscape for lung cancer treatment is evolving with the approval of new and exciting novel therapies. Within the last decade numerous ICIs have been approved for use in the management of the most common subtype of lung cancer, NSCLC. The ICI agents currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in NSCLC include ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab. These agents are approved for specific indications; therefore, they are not interchangeable. This review focuses on the landmark trials that led to each FDA-approved indication, as well as common toxicities seen with use of these agents. It also discusses the use of ICIs in special populations and unique considerations prior to initiation of treatment with these novel therapies in a patient with NSCLC. ICIs can provide a breakthrough treatment option for the management of NSCLC and are rapidly being adopted into clinical practice. It is important to be familiar with appropriate selection of an ICI therapy option for each patient based on approved indication, unique considerations, and anticipated toxicities.",

Clinical risk factors for development of immune-related adverse events (irAE) were also explored. aNSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy outside of clinical trials were identified retrospectively. All patients were treated at one of six British Columbia Cancer clinics between August 2017 and June 2019. Patients were dichotomized using baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, </\u22656.4) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR, </\u2265441.8). Factors associated with OS were assessed with Cox proportional hazard models. Logistic regression models were utilized in landmark analysis of risk factors for irAE. Among 220 patients, median age was 70.0 years, 55.0% were female, 40.5% had baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 2/3, and 95.5% received frontline pembrolizumab. Median OS for the cohort was 11.8 months (95% CI: 8.7-15.4). On multivariable analysis, baseline NLR \u22656.4 [hazard ratio (HR): 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46-3.64, P<0.001], baseline PLR \u2265441.8 (HR: 2.03, 95% CI 1.22-3.37, P=0.006), and pre-treatment ECOG PS 2/3 (HR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.48-3.26, P<0.001) were associated with worse OS. The incidence of any grade irAE and irAE grade \u22653 were 40.5% and 12.3%, respectively. ECOG PS 2/3 ( High NLR and PLR were associated with shorter OS in a cohort of patients receiving largely frontline pembrolizumab for aNSCLC in routine practice. ECOG PS 2/3 was associated with higher risk of developing an irAE. Given that NLR and PLR values are easily obtainable, prospective studies are warranted to confirm their prognostic significance in this patient population and explore a predictive utility.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provided a paradigm shift for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment and improved the clinical prognosis of such patients. Pembrolizumab is a humanized anti-programmed death cell protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, approved for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This article investigated and reported on the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced NSCLC in our center since 2019. Patients with clinical stage III-IV NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab for \u22654 cycles were enrolled as participants in this study. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. A cycle was defined as 3 weeks of treatment. We assessed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab through the collection of researcher-assessed tumor response, survival, and safety data. A total of 24 patients were included in this study. The median follow-up time was 9 months (3-20 months) and the median period of pembrolizumab therapy was 7 cycles (4-21 cycles). The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.8% and disease control rate (DCR) was 70.8%. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were not reached. A total of 2 programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative participants were treated with pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy and there was no significant progression during the follow-up period. During the follow-up period, 8 patients underwent surgery. The major pathological response (MPR) was 75% and pathological complete response (pCR) was 50%. A case that was preoperatively diagnosed with clinical stage IV achieved pCR after 6 cycles of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy. The incidence of adverse effects (AEs) was 83.3%, and 16.7% of these were serious AEs (grade \u22653), which was similar to the incidence reported in previous studies. This real-world data supports the use of pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC, including those cases that are PD-L1 negative. More importantly, pembrolizumab immunotherapy can also provide the potential of local treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC, which has wide application prospects in the field of surgery.",

Although several management guidelines exist for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced toxicities, uncommon, complicated, and life-threatening immune-related adverse events remain challenging for oncologists. In this report, we presented a male patient with NSCLC who received pembrolizumab during disease progression. He developed interstitial pembrolizumab-induced organizing pneumonia (OP). The patient received 9 months of anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab when he presented with dry cough and fatigue. The patient developed a solitary nodular lung lesion mimicking a newly occurred metastatic lesion in the lung without a significant circulating tumor marker increase. Sputum analysis was negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. A computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was conducted and showed alveolar fibrous thickness and various lymphocyte infiltration. Immunotherapy-related OP was identified, and he subsequently responded well to corticosteroids. This case describes a clinical situation, where PD-1-induced OP is radiologically similar to NSCLC disease progression in the lungs. Oncologists should be aware of uncommon pulmonary PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor toxicity. Lung biopsy may help to distinguish immune-related pneumonitis, lung infections, and progressive nodular lesions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several clinical studies have evaluated the first-line use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, the differences in safety and efficacy between the various types of ICIs still require investigation. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the first-line use of ICIs combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with non-squamous NSCLC by meta-analysis and indirect comparison. Literature searches were performed using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and Wanfang Data to identify all relevant randomized clinical trials for non-squamous NSCLC after 2010. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse effects (AEs) were pooled for meta-analysis and indirect comparison. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with PFS. The meta-analysis showed that the additional use of ICIs could significantly improve PFS and OS. The indirect comparison showed no significant difference in pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and atezolizumab + chemotherapy in the reducing of disease progression, while a significant difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) was found between pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared with atezolizumab + chemotherapy. A significant increase in grade \u22653 AEs was observed with the additional use of atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy. Subgroups including PD-1 status [high (>50%), intermediate (1-49%), and negative (<1%) expression], sex (male and female), smoking status (current or former smoker, and never smoked), liver metastases (with and without), age (>65 and \u226465) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score (ECOG=0 and ECOG=1) were all associated with better PFS. This meta-analysis confirmed the treatment effects of ICIs combined with chemotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC. The pembrolizumab combination group had a greater RMST benefit compared with the atezolizumab combination group. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated a PFS advantage for non-squamous NSCLC using ICIs combined with chemotherapy irrespective of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level, smoking status, liver metastasis status, sex, age and ECOG score. Due to the significant increase in AEs (> grade 3), more attention should be paid to the additional use of atezolizumab.",

    "abstract": "Novel treatment strategies incorporating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the first-line setting of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provided relevant improvements in survival outcomes. Among NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score \u226550%, identifying the ones to be addressed to pembrolizumab monotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy combinations is a matter of debate, taking into account the risks of overtreatment and toxicity. Here we report the clinical stories of four NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score \u226550% and good performance status, sharing high tumor burden including serosal involvement. After having rapidly progressed on first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, they achieved major clinical and radiological response to pembrolizumab-chemotherapy combination. These cases prove the feasibility and effectiveness of salvage chemo-immunotherapy in pembrolizumab-refractory NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "A phase II trial investigating the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA\u00ae) administered prior to surgery for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been conducted (NCT03197467). We report the first clinical results of a planned interim safety analysis after 15 patients were enrolled. Patients with resectable NSCLC stage II/IIIA were included. Two cycles of pembrolizumab (200\u202fmg intravenously once every 3 weeks) were administered prior to surgery. The primary objectives were to assess the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy and to evaluate antitumor activity. We analyzed the clinical parameters as well as pathological and radiological tumor response data. The NSCLC histology was adenocarcinoma for 13 patients and squamous cell carcinoma for 2 patients. All patients but two underwent 2 cycles of pembrolizumab prior to surgery. Four patients (27 %) presented a major pathologic response. Significant tumor target response in positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) was detected in all 4 pathologic responders. Nevertheless, the PET findings mismatched the tumor load in some patients. A PD-L1 expression \u226510 % in the pretreatment biopsy was associated with at least major pathologic response. Five patients (33 %) presented grade 2-3 treatment related adverse events (TRAE), the overall postoperative morbidity was 7 % and 30-day mortality was 0 %. Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab is a feasible therapy in surgical lung cancer patients. It was associated with tolerable toxicity and did not compromise tumor resection.",

    "abstract": "Improved outcome in tobacco smoking patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following immunotherapy has previously been reported. However, little is known regarding this association during first-line immunotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression. In this study we compared clinical outcomes according to the smoking status of two large multicenter cohorts. We compared clinical outcomes according to the smoking status (never smokers vs. current/former smokers) of two retrospective multicenter cohorts of metastatic NSCLC patients, treated with first-line pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy. A total of 962 NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550% who received first-line pembrolizumab and 462 NSCLC patients who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were included in the study. Never smokers were confirmed to have a significantly higher risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.49 [95% CI: 1.15-1.92], p =\u20090.0022) and death (HR = 1.38 [95% CI: 1.02-1.87], p =\u20090.0348) within the pembrolizumab cohort. On the contrary, a nonsignificant trend towards a reduced risk of disease progression (HR = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.52-1.05], p =\u20090.1003) and death (HR = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.45-1.01], p =\u20090.0593) were reported for never smokers within the chemotherapy cohort. After a random case-control matching, 424 patients from both cohorts were paired. Within the matched pembrolizumab cohort, never smokers had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.68 [95% CI: 1.17-2.40], p =\u20090.0045) and a nonsignificant trend towards a shortened overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.32 [95% CI: 0.84-2.07], p =\u20090.2205). On the contrary, never smokers had a significantly longer PFS (HR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.49-0.95], p =\u20090.0255) and OS (HR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.45-0.97], p =\u20090,0356) compared to current/former smoker patients within the matched chemotherapy cohort. On pooled multivariable analysis, the interaction term between smoking status and treatment modality was concordantly statistically significant with respect to ORR (p =\u20090.0074), PFS (p =\u20090.0001) and OS (p =\u20090.0020), confirming the significantly different impact of smoking status across the two cohorts. Among metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression \u226550% receiving first-line pembrolizumab, current/former smokers experienced improved PFS and OS. On the contrary, worse outcomes were reported among current/former smokers receiving first-line chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Although immune-checkpoint inhibitors have become a new therapeutic option for recurrent/metastatic non-small cell lung cancers (R/M-NSCLC), its clinical benefit in the real-world is still unclear. We investigated 1181 Korean patients with programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive [tumor proportion score (TPS)\u2009\u2265\u200910% by the SP263 assay or\u2009\u2265\u200950% by the 22C3 assay] R/M-NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The median age was 67\u00a0years, 13% of patients had ECOG-PS\u2009\u2265\u20092, and 27% were never-smokers. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (61%) and 18.1% harbored an EGFR activating mutation or ALK rearrangement. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab were administered to 51.3% and 48.7, respectively, and 42% received them beyond the third-line chemotherapy. Objective response rate (ORR) was 28.6%. Pembrolizumab group showed numerically higher ORR (30.7%) than the nivolumab group (26.4%), but it was comparable with that of the nivolumab group having PD-L1 TPS\u2009\u2265\u200950% (32.4%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.9 (95% CI 0-27.9) and 10.7\u00a0months (95% CI 0-28.2), respectively. In multivariable analysis, concordance of TPS\u2009\u2265\u200950% in both PD-L1 assays and the development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were two significant predictors of better ORR, PFS, and OS. EGFR mutation could also predict significantly worse OS outcomes. The real-world benefit of later-line anti-PD1 antibodies was comparable to clinical trials in patients with R/M-NSCLC, although patients generally were more heavily pretreated and had poorer ECOG-PS. Concordantly high PD-L1 TPS \u2265\u200950% and development of irAE could independently predict better treatment outcomes, while EGFR mutation negatively affected OS.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include immunotherapy. Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 125 (Ca-125) levels are associated with poorer prognoses of resected NSCLC, but currently no predictive biomarkers exist for immunotherapy response. This study evaluated CEA and Ca-125 as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy efficiency in patients with metastatic NSCLC. The single-centre observational retrospective study includes NSCLC stage III/IV patients treated with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The primary study endpoint was treatment response assessed by CT-scan following RECIST-criteria 1.1. CEA/Ca-125 serum values were determined at initiation of treatment and repeated every 2 weeks. Values closest to the day of CT-scan were compared to baseline values. A total of 136 patients were treated with mono-immunotherapy. Of these, 73 patients were included in the CEA group and 53 patients were included in the Ca-125 group. Baseline CEA and Ca-125 ranged from 8.14 to 5,909 and 1.1 to 4,238 respectively. The sensitivity for Ca-125 as predictor for tumor response was 62.9% (95% CI=61.8%-63.6%), specificity 61.1% (95% CI=60.2%-62.0%), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 75.9% (95% CI=75.2%-76.7%). For CEA, the sensitivity was 72.0% (95% CI=71.5%-72.5%), specificity 47.1% (95% CI 46.4%-47.8%), with a PPV of 80.0% (95% CI=79.6%-80.4%). Increased serum CEA might predict tumor progression in NSCLC patients treated with PD-L1 inhibitors. Unconfirmed progression accompanied by increased CEA would support discontinuation of the immunotherapy, while continuation would be advised when serum CEA is not increased.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide among the malignant tumors. The treatment of lung cancer was difficult in the decade years. Currently, the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has changed the pattern of lung cancer treatment. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, plus platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferred treatment modality for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The success of pembrolizumab in lung cancer has increased interest in expanding the use of neoadjuvant treatment. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are the most common adverse reactions in immunotherapy. The balance between the benefits and risks is crucial in this setting. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a routine procedure of resectable NSCLC treatment. It appears to favor low postoperative complication rate. The prolonged air leakage (PAL) is the most common complication after VATS, and the bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is the most serious complication. The management of adverse events after VATS, especially in the setting of immune therapy, need to be raised. Here, we report a case of BPF following VATS lobectomy, which firstly presented the treatment-related adverse event with neoadjuvant combination therapy of pembrolizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed. Literature on novel neoadjuvant immunotherapy was also reviewed in the present study.",

We present the patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Patients (N\u00a0= 1189) were randomized to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab, or chemotherapy. PROs were exploratory. Changes in Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) average symptom burden index, LCSS 3-item global index, EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS), and EQ-5D utility index were analyzed descriptively. Mixed-effect model repeated measures and time-to-first deterioration and improvement analyses were conducted. PRO completion rates were generally greater than 80%. On-treatment improvements from baseline in LCSS measures of symptom burden and global health status with nivolumab plus ipilimumab generally met or exceeded the minimal important difference (smallest clinically meaningful change) from weeks 24 and 30, respectively; improvements with chemotherapy generally remained below the minimal important difference. Mean on-treatment EQ-5D VAS scores for both treatments approached the U.K. population norm at week 24, remaining so throughout the treatment period. Mixed-effect model repeated measures analyses revealed numerically greater improvements from baseline with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy across LCSS average symptom burden index and 3-item global index, and EQ-5D VAS and utility index. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab had delayed time-to-first deterioration (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.74 [0.56 to 0.98]) and a trend for more rapid time-to-first improvement (1.24 [0.98 to 1.59]) versus chemotherapy.

    "abstract": "First-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab has shown improved overall survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to investigate whether the addition of a limited course (two cycles) of chemotherapy to this combination would further enhance the clinical benefit. This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 103 hospitals in 19 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with treatment-naive, histologically confirmed stage IV or recurrent NSCLC, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system via permuted blocks (block size of four) to nivolumab (360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) combined with histology-based, platinum doublet chemotherapy (intravenously every 3 weeks for two cycles; experimental group), or chemotherapy alone (every 3 weeks for four cycles; control group). Randomisation was stratified by tumour histology, sex, and PD-L1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomly assigned patients. Safety was analysed in all treated patients. Results reported here are from a pre-planned interim analysis (when the study met its primary endpoint) and an exploratory longer-term follow-up analysis. This study is active but no longer recruiting patients, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03215706. Between Aug 24, 2017, and Jan 30, 2019, 1150 patients were enrolled and 719 (62\u00b75%) randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab with two cycles of chemotherapy (n=361 [50%]) or four cycles of chemotherapy alone (n=358 [50%]). At the pre-planned interim analysis (median follow-up 9\u00b77 months [IQR 6\u00b74-12\u00b78]), overall survival in all randomly assigned patients was significantly longer in the experimental group than in the control group (median 14\u00b71 months [95% CI 13\u00b72-16\u00b72] vs 10\u00b77 months [9\u00b75-12\u00b74]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b769 [96\u00b771% CI 0\u00b755-0\u00b787]; p=0\u00b700065). With 3\u00b75 months longer median follow-up (median 13\u00b72 months [IQR 6\u00b74-17\u00b70]), median overall survival was 15\u00b76 months (95% CI 13\u00b79-20\u00b70) in the experimental group versus 10\u00b79 months (9\u00b75-12\u00b76) in the control group (HR 0\u00b766 [95% CI 0\u00b755-0\u00b780]). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (in 24 [7%] patients in the experimental group vs 32 [9%] in the control group), anaemia (21 [6%] vs 50 [14%]), diarrhoea (14 [4%] vs two [1%]), increased lipase (22 [6%] vs three [1%]), and asthenia (tjree [1%] vs eight [2%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 106 (30%) patients in the experimental group and 62 (18%) in the control group. Seven (2%) deaths in the experimental group (acute kidney failure, diarrhoea, hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, pneumonitis, sepsis with acute renal insufficiency, and thrombocytopenia; one patient each) and six (2%) deaths in the control group (anaemia, febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, pulmonary sepsis, respiratory failure, and sepsis; one patient each) were treatment related. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with two cycles of chemotherapy provided a significant improvement in overall survival versus chemotherapy alone and had a favourable risk-benefit profile. These data support this regimen as a new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC. Bristol Myers Squibb.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab monotherapy or combination therapy is an approved treatment for various advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) indications. We review published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of pembrolizumab as treatment for NSCLC and provide in-depth assessment of their methodologies. Fourteen studies were selected through searches of the PubMed database. Modeling approaches, survival and cost estimation, and utility analyses were compared and evaluated. These publications covered regulatory-approved pembrolizumab NSCLC indications based on the following randomized clinical trials: KEYNOTE-010 (one publication), KEYNOTE-024 (six), KEYNOTE-042 (four), KEYNOTE-189 (two), and KEYNOTE-407 (one). Differences were observed in health states (progression free, progressed disease, and death vs stable disease, progressed disease, death, and treatment discontinuation), modeling approaches (partitioned survival vs Markov), survival extrapolation/transition probability estimation, inclusion of additional costs to drug, disease management and adverse event costs (e.g., programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] testing, subsequent treatment, terminal care), treatment duration approaches (trial-based time on treatment vs treat to progression), utility sources (trial data vs literature), and utility analyses (time to death vs progression status). Certain aspects of variability across models were problematic, including deviation from observed treatment utilization within trials and predicted long-term mortality risks for pembrolizumab higher than historical real-world NSCLC mortality data prior to the availability of pembrolizumab. Consequently, results differed even among studies examining the same population and comparator within similar time intervals. Differences in methodology across CEAs may lead to distinct results and conclusions. Payers and policy makers should carefully examine study designs and assumptions and choose CEAs with greater validity and accuracy for evidence-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1 agents, have become part of the standard of care treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients that benefit from anti-PD-1 treatments. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-L1 are major players in the ICI mechanism of action. In this study, we assess the impact of real-world clinicopathological variables, including TILs and PD-L1, on anti-PD-1 efficacy. We performed a monocenter retrospective study in advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between January 2015 and February 2019. The impact of baseline clinical and pathological variables was assessed by univariate and multivariate models. TILs, defined as CD8+T-cells, and PD-L1 were scored in tumor and stroma, and correlated with progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We included 366 patients of whom 141 were assessed for tumor and stromal TILs. The median follow-up time was 487 days. In the whole cohort, PFS was associated with high tumor PD-L1, high albumin and good performance. OS was associated with low LDH, high albumin, good performance and 'first-line treatment'. In the TILs subcohort, stromal TILs had the strongest impact on PFS and OS. Stromal TILs were a stronger marker for PFS and OS than tumoral TILs, tumoral PD-L1 or stromal PD-L1. Remaining factors for PFS and OS were albumin and albumin with LDH, respectively. This real-world study on clinicopathological features shows that stromal CD8\u202f+\u202fTILs were the strongest predictor for PFS and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC on anti-PD-1 therapy. Other predictors for PFS and OS included albumin and albumin together with LDH, respectively. This study highlights the pivotal role of the stromal compartment in the mechanisms of action of ICI, and the need for further studies aiming to overcome this stromal firewall.",

    "abstract": "In this article we summarize our personal non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highlights of the virtual ASCO 2020 meeting, covering developments in early and advanced-stage NSCLC. Until recently early stage NSCLC patients were treated independently of their genetic profile. Now the ADAURA study proved that postoperative osimertinib significantly prolongs disease-free survival compared to standard chemotherapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC , underlining the high efficacy of targeted therapies in early stages. In advanced-stage disease, of course immunotherapy (IO) was at the center of attention. Final analysis of KEYNOTE-189 (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone) and 3\u2011year update of CheckMate\u00a0227 (nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus standard chemotherapy) proved the long-term overall survival benefit of IO combinations in the first-line setting independent of PD-L1 status. The innovative CheckMate 9LA study demonstrated rapid disease control with limited-course chemotherapy plus IO doublet, while sparing chemotoxicity and may soon become a\u00a0new clinical treatment choice. Moreover, the phase\u00a0II CITYSCAPE trial presented significant response rates of the TIGIT-inhibitor tiragolumab plus atezolizumab in PD-L1 positive NSCLC. For HER2-mutated patients a\u00a0highly effective drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan was presented in a\u00a0phase\u00a0II study, extending targeted agents in genetically driven NSCLC. Altogether, ASCO 2020 could excite with inspiring new data for an optimized and more individualized NSCLC treatment regimen, contributing to a\u00a0better outcome for both early and late-stage diseased patients and continuing to decrease lung cancer mortality.",

    "abstract": "Atezolizumab is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) targeted monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 interacting with its receptors PD-1 and B7-1, thereby enhancing anticancer immunity. Some real-world efficacy and safety studies of anti-PD-1 antibody have been previously reported. However, there have been no reports investigating the efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy in clinical practice which have focused on performance status and previous anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive advanced NSCLC patients who received atezolizumab monotherapy between April 2018 and February 2019 at eight institutions. A total of 152 patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. A total of 38 patients (25%) had already been treated with anti-PD-1 treatment (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) before atezolizumab. The median OS and TTF was 384\u2009days (12.8 months) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 206-424), and 42\u2009days (1.4 months) (95% CI: 27-56) in all patients, respectively. ECOG PS 0 had significantly longer OS (median OS; not reached, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and TTF (median TTF; 63\u2009days, p = 0.012) compared with PS 1 or 2-3. Most retreated patients were unable to continue atezolizumab for a longer period, but seven patients (18.4%) were able to continue atezolizumab over four months as an ICI retreatment. In previously treated advanced NSCLC patients, atezolizumab monotherapy demonstrated good efficacy and safety regardless of heavily treated patients in real-world clinical practice, and ECOG PS 0 was a favorable predictive factor. The efficacy of retreatment with atezolizumab was limited but was well tolerated in patients treated with prior anti-PD-1 antibody.",

An observational, retrospective, and pharmacovigilance study based on the FAERS database collected between January 2014 and December 2019 was conducted. ICI-related AEs were defined as adverse reactions in patients using anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab). Neurologic AEs previously reported to be associated with ICI were evaluated in the disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Among 50,406 ICI-related reports, 3619 (7.2%) neurological case was found: 1985 with anti-PD-1, 372 with anti-PD-L1, 366 with anti-CTLA-4, and 896 with the combination of ICIs. In comparison to non-ICI drug use, ICI use demonstrated higher risk for neurologic complication, including hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis/myelitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, vasculitis, and neuropathy. The risk of neurologic AEs associated\u00a0with ICI combination therapy was as high as or even higher than ICI monotherapy, most significantly in hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. The proportion of serious neurological events and death related to combination therapy has been decreasing in recent years. Older age, male and female sex, and metastasis were not significant risk factors for the incidence of neurologic ICI-related AEs. Patients at older age, with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs. ICI use is associated with a higher risk of neurological complications, with dual ICI therapy posing a higher risk, while older age, sex, or metastasis were not. Patients at older age, with certain cancer types, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become standard of care for many patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These agents often cause immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), which have been associated with increased overall survival (OS). Intracranial disease control and OS for patients experiencing IRAEs with metastatic NSCLC and brain metastases have not yet been described. We performed a single-institution, retrospective review of patients with NSCLC and existing diagnosis of brain metastasis, who underwent pembrolizumab treatment and developed any grade IRAE. The primary outcome of the study was intracranial time to treatment failure (TTF), defined from time of pembrolizumab initiation to new intracranial disease progression or death. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. A total of 63 patients with NSCLC brain metastasis were identified, and 24 developed IRAEs. Patients with any grade IRAEs had longer OS (21 vs. 10\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.004), systemic TTF (15 vs. 4\u00a0months, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and intracranial TTF (14 vs. 5\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.001), relative to patients without IRAEs. Presence of IRAEs and high PD-L1 (\u2265\u200950%), but not absent/moderate PD-L1 (0-49%), had a positive association for OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF. Following multivariable analysis, IRAE experienced on pembrolizumab was an independent predictor of OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF. In our series of patients with NSCLC and brain metastases treated with pembrolizumab, IRAE presence was associated with a significant increase in OS, systemic TTF, and intracranial TTF. Future studies with increased cohorts will clarify how IRAEs should be interpreted among molecular subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Immuno checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including anti-PD-L1 antibody have shown certain therapeutic effects on various cancer types. Here, we reported a case of the patient with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showing a complete response to nivolumab combined with chemotherapy. A 66-year-old male was diagnosed with stage IIIA large cell lung cancer, cT2N2M0, who was considered impossible to have a tumor resection due to his right hilar node enlargement. The diameter of the neoplasms was 22mm, and the patient wanted to get the chance of surgery. Light of all, surgery was the only radical treatment option and therefore planned. After administering 2 cycles of nivolumab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin, the second chest computed tomography (CT) after the first scanning revealed the tumor apparent shrinking and vascular compression was disappeared than before. We performed a right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Pathologically, we confirmed no large cell lung cancer cells in the resected lung specimen. The follow-up showing that patient remains alive without recurrence to these days. This case report may provide a clue to the future development of induction therapy using nivolumab and surgery. The combined treatment of nivolumab and chemotherapy is likely to be considered as an optional management of resectable NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that PD-L1 polymorphisms are associated with the efficacy and immune-related adverse events of PD-1 blockade with nivolumab. However, the association between PD-L1 polymorphisms and survival outcomes under PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is still uncertain. Here, we aimed to investigate whether PD-L1 polymorphisms are associated with survival outcomes in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with nivolumab. PD-1/PD-L1 polymorphisms and survival outcomes were retrospectively analysed in two independent cohorts (133 patients treated with nivolumab and 96 patients with no treatment history of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) (the non-ICI cohort)) with advanced NSCLC. Among the 7 studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms, PD-L1 rs822339 and rs1411262 were associated with overall survival (OS) in patients treated with nivolumab. Patients with the A/A genotype of rs822339 had a significantly longer OS than those with A/G or G/G genotypes (not reached versus 12.0 months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18-0.64; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). A similar survival benefit with the A/A genotype was observed regardless of driver mutation status. In multivariate analysis, performance status (PS) and PD-L1 rs822339 genotype were independent prognostic factors for OS. In the non-ICI cohort, the PD-L1 rs822339 genotype did not correlate with OS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.31-1.70; p\u00a0=\u00a00.55). The T/T genotype of rs1411262 also showed a significant prolongation of OS compared to that with the C/T or C/C genotypes in patients treated with nivolumab. PD-L1 polymorphisms are associated with favourable OS in nivolumab-treated NSCLC patients and may be useful predictive biomarkers, regardless of driver mutation status.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate serum tumor markers (STM) as predictive biomarkers in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemo-immunotherapy. Patients having received platinum-based chemo-(CHT) and PD-1/PD-L1-directed immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapy were retrospectively followed. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), cytokeratin-19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were routinely measured at NSCLC diagnosis. The marker with the highest relative elevation was defined \"leading STM\", its change was assessed between CHT-ICI as well as mono-ICI maintenance initiation and the respective subsequent restaging. Corresponding computed tomography evaluations were analyzed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). For CHT-ICI combination and subsequent mono-ICI-maintenance therapy, leading STM and RECIST response were evaluated regarding progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in Kaplan-Meier analyses. Among 80 CHT-ICI patients (41% women, mean age 63 years), median PFS was 5 months (M;4,9), median OS was 15M (10,/). PFS was significantly (p=0.042) longer, when the leading STM had decreased at first restaging under CHT-ICI combination therapy (9M (5,12; n=41) vs 5M (3,6; n=16)). In the 54 (67.5%) patients who received subsequent mono-ICI maintenance therapy, STM decrease was similarly associated with significantly (p<0.001) longer PFS (16M (7,/; n=16) vs 3.5M (2,6; n=22)). Patients with radiologically stable or progressive disease and concomitant leading STM decrease had similar PFS in the CHT-ICI combination phase (4M (3,7; n=16) vs 4.5M (2,6; n=14)), but longer PFS in the mono-ICI maintenance setting (13M (7,16; n=10) vs 3M (2,4; n=17)). Median OS was not reached in most subgroups. Leading STM dynamics provide predictive biomarker information additional to radiological response evaluation patients receiving CHT-ICI combination therapy, especially in the mono-ICI maintenance setting.",

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent tumor-directed thermal ablation, embolization, or selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) between January 1, 2011, and May 1, 2019, and received anti-programmed death 1/PD-L1 agents \u2264 90 days before or \u2264 30 days after the interventional procedure. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and procedural complications \u2264 90 days after the procedure were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The study included 65 eligible patients (49% female; age 63 years \u00b1 11.1). The most common tumors were metastatic melanoma (n\u00a0= 28) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n\u00a0= 12). Patients underwent 78 procedures (12 patients underwent > 1 procedure), most frequently SIRT (35.9%) and cryoablation (28.2%). The most common target organs were liver (46.2%), bone (24.4%), and lung (9.0%). Most patients received ICI monotherapy with pembrolizumab (n\u00a0= 30), nivolumab (n\u00a0= 22), and atezolizumab (n\u00a0= 6); 7 patients received ipilimumab and nivolumab. Seven (10.8%) patients experienced an irAE (71.4% grade 1-2), mostly affecting the skin. Median time to irAE was 33 days (interquartile range, 19-38 days). Five irAEs occurred in patients with melanoma, and no irAEs occurred in patients with NSCLC. Management required corticosteroids (n\u00a0= 3) and immunotherapy discontinuation (n\u00a0= 1); all irAEs resolved to grade \u2264 1. There were 4 intraprocedural and 32 postprocedural complications (77.8% grade < 3). No grade 5 irAEs and/or procedural complications occurred.

    "abstract": "The armamentarium for lung cancer immunotherapy has been strengthened using two groups of monoclonal antibodies: 1) anti-PD-1 antibodies, including pembrolizumab and nivolumab, which block the programmed death 1 receptor on the lymphocyte surface, resulting in increasing activity of these cells, and 2) anti-PD-L1 antibodies, including atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab, which block the ligand for the PD-1 molecule on tumor cells and on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The effectiveness of both groups of antibodies has been proven in many clinical trials, which translates into positive immunotherapeutic registrations for cancer patients. Regarding the predictive factor, PD-L1 expression on cancer cells is the only biomarker validated in prospective clinical trials used for qualification to immunotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, it is not an ideal one. Unfortunately, no clinical benefits could be noted in patients with high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells against the effectiveness of immunotherapy that may be observed in patients without PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, the mechanism of antitumor immune response is extremely complex, multistage, and depends on many factors. Cancer cells could be recognized by the immune system, provided tumor-specific antigen presentation, and these arise as a result of somatic mutations in tumor cells. Based on novel immunotherapy registration, high tumor mutation burden (TMB) has become an important predictive factor. The intensity of lymphocyte infiltration in tumor tissue may be another predictive factor. The effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy is observed in patients with high expression of genes associated with the effector function of T lymphocytes (i.e., their ability to produce IFN-gamma). This does not end the list of potential factors that become useful in qualification of cancer patients for immunotherapy. There remains a need to search for new and perfect predictive factors for immunotherapy.",

In the present study, we explored whether PD-L1 was regulated by mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), which is frequently mutated in NSCLC and results in poor prognosis and low survival rates. We verified that PD-L1 levels were dramatically increased in KRAS mutant cell lines, particularly in NCI-H441 cells with KRAS G12V mutation. Overexpression of KRAS G12V remarkably elevated PD-L1 messenger RNA and protein levels, while suppression of KRAS G12V led to decreased PD-L1 levels in NCI-H441 cells.

    "abstract": "Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung consists of only spindle-shaped tumor cells, and accounts for approximately 13.3% of all sarcomatoid carcinomas (SCs), which are a rare subtype of poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung has very poor prognosis owing to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This case report describes a 76-year-old man who presented with complaints of dry cough and right-sided neck pain and was later diagnosed with spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. He had a medical history of type 2 diabetes, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hepatitis B and a 20 pack-year history of smoking. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass with a thick-walled cavity in the right upper lobe of the lung. His neck pain was consistent with PET-CT images, indicating metastases due to invasion of lung cancer cells. The expression of PD-L1 in more than 90% of the tumor cells of the lung biopsy tissue led to the administration of pembrolizumab. The lung and metastatic tumors dramatically decreased in size after 9 weeks, and no tumor regrowth was observed over 11 courses of pembrolizumab administration. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports describing the use of pembrolizumab for spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. This case report suggests that immunotherapy could be a promising treatment option for rare types of lung cancers, including spindle cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs). A correlation between the development of irAEs and efficacy has been suggested; however, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and the development of these events. We performed a retrospective study of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy at our institution between May 2015 and April 2018 (n = 44). Patients were categorized into two groups, specifically those with irAEs (irAE group) or without (non-irAE group), and we evaluated the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Predictors of irAEs were examined by multivariate analysis. irAEs of any grade occurred in 31 (70.5%) patients. The median PFS was 10.9 months in the irAE group versus 3.7 months in the non-irAE group ( In patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, ORR, DCR, and PFS were significantly better in the irAE group than in the non-irAE group. High PD-L1 expression, at the time of pretreatment, was identified as an independent predictor of irAE development. We believe that more careful management of irAEs for individuals with high PD-L1 expression is needed to improve clinical benefits. Further, PD-L1 expression might be useful for ICI risk management.",

Single-agent pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression \u2265 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD-L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic antibody) in first-line NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination of first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD-L1 expression \u22651%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best-treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. Primary objective: to determine the effectiveness and safety of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD-L1 expression. to maintain the currency of evidence using a living systematic review approach. We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 21 October 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first-line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single- or double-ICI treatment to standard first-line therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab). All data come from 'international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically-confirmed stage IV NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anti-cancer treatment for advanced disease. Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta-analyses where appropriate using the random-effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I\u00b2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity. Main results We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first-line single- (six trials) or double- (two trials) agent ICI with platinum-based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first-line single- and double-agent ICsI with platinum-based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate-to-low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD-L1 expressions, with PD-L1 \u2265 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut-off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL-1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD-L1 \u2265 50. Single-agent ICI In the PD-L1 expression \u2265 50% group single-agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). In this group, single-agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low-certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low-certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD-L1 expression \u2265 50%, which suggested that single-agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low-certainty evidence). In the included studies, treatment-related AEs were not reported according to PD-L1 expression levels. Grade 3-4 AEs may be less frequent with single-agent ICI compared to platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I\u00b2 = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low-certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of single-agent ICI compared to platinum-based chemotherapy according to the level of PD-L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. Double-agent ICI Double-ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in people with PD-L1 expression \u226550% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD-L1 groups. Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD-L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3-4 AEs may not differ between double-ICI treatment and platinum-based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I\u00b2 = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low-certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of double-agent ICI according to the level of PD-L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review suggests that single-agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD-L1 \u226550% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression-free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD-L1 \u226550% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression-free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups.",

    "abstract": "Patients with driver-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and performance status (PS) of 3-4 do not tolerate chemotherapy well. There is currently no suitable treatment plan, and best supportive care is offered to patients with PS of 3 or greater. Some retrospective studies have shown the poor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced NSCLC patients with PS \u22652 regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, some recent studies suggest that the anti-angiogenic drug has an immunomodulatory effect and can enhance immune efficacy. Here, we report a 72-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of driver-negative lung squamous cell carcinoma with respiratory failure and other serious medical conditions, resulting in PS of 4. We tried administering nivolumab (immune checkpoint inhibitor, ICI) in combination with anlotinib (angiogenic inhibitor) treatment to the patient. After 2 months of combination treatment, improved PS and a partial response (PR) was observed. Presently, the patient is on regular follow-up for over 13 months without any evidence of disease progression or distant metastasis. Our successful treatment of this driver-negative lung squamous cell carcinoma patient provides optimistic data to support the synergistic effect of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy, and also demonstrated the potential application of this treatment regimen in critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment is mandatory for the single agent pembrolizumab treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 testing has been validated and is currently certified only on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials but not on cytological smears. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients, having only cytological material available, cannot be tested for PD-L1 and treated with pembrolizumab. In this study, we aimed to validate PD-L1 IHC on cytological smears prospectively by comparing clone SP263 staining in 150 paired histological samples and cytological smears of NSCLC patients. We prospectively enrolled 150 consecutive advanced NSCLC patients. The clone SP263 was selected as, in a previous study of our group, it showed higher accuracy compared with clones 28-8 and 22-C3, with good cyto-histological agreement using a cut-off of 50%. For cyto-histological concordance, we calculated the kappa coefficient using two different cut-offs according to the percentage of PD-L1 positive neoplastic cells (<1%, 1-49% and \u2a7e50%; <50%, \u2a7e50%). The overall agreement between histological samples and cytological smears was moderate (kappa\u2009=\u20090.537). However, when the cyto-histological concordance was calculated using the cut-off of 50%, the agreement was good (kappa\u2009=\u20090.740). With the same cut-off, and assuming as gold-standard the results on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials, PD-L1 evaluation on smears showed specificity and negative predictive values of 98.1% and 93.9%, respectively. Cytological smears can be used in routine clinical practice for PD-L1 assessment with a cut-off of 50%, expanding the potential pool of NSCLC patients as candidates for first-line single agent pembrolizumab therapy.",

An anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted using pooled individual patient data (IPD) from the ITT population in KEYNOTE-021G, KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 ( The estimated HR (95% CI) of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs nivolumab + ipilimumab was 0.80 (0.59,1.09) and 0.53 (0.41,0.68) for OS and PFS, respectively.

    "abstract": "Quavonlimab (MK-1308), a novel anti-CTLA-4 antibody, in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in a phase I study. Dose-escalation (DE) phase: patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors received an initial flat dose of quavonlimab as monotherapy [25 mg (cohort 1), 75 mg (cohort 2), or 200 mg (cohort 3)] followed by four treatments of the same quavonlimab dose plus pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W). Dose-confirmation phase (DC): patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received first-line quavonlimab [25 mg Q3W (arm A), 25 mg Q6W (arm B), 75 mg Q6W (arm C), or 75 mg Q3W (arm E)] plus pembrolizumab. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and establishment of the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of quavonlimab when used with pembrolizumab. Objective response rate (ORR) was a secondary endpoint. Efficacy based on PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and changes in circulating CD4+/CD8+ cells were exploratory endpoints. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in DE [n\u00a0= 14 (cohort 1); n\u00a0= 17 (cohort 2); n\u00a0= 8 (cohort 3)] and 134 in DC [n\u00a0= 40 (arm A); n\u00a0= 40 (arm B); n\u00a0= 40 (arm C); n\u00a0= 14 (arm E)]. Maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs; graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03) occurred in 0%, 23.5%, and 75.0% of patients in DE cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 35.0%, 30.0%, 35.0%, and 57.1% of patients in DC arms A, B, C, and E, respectively.

PD-L1 expression and total number of circulating CD4+ cells correlated with ORR. Quavonlimab 25 mg Q6W plus pembrolizumab demonstrated similar efficacy and a better safety profile among all quavonlimab doses/schedules evaluated; this regimen was the chosen RP2D.",

    "abstract": "For a definite indication for immunotherapy, finding appropriate biomarkers that are predictive of treatment responses is necessary. Inflammatory cytokines which play critical roles in immunity against infectious sources or cancer cells are suggested to activate immune cells after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Through activation of immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, or tumor infiltrating dendritic cells, inflammatory cytokines usually increase after programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. There have been several studies evaluating the predictive value of early changes in inflammatory cytokines in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immunotherapy. In this mini-review, we went through recent articles on potential blood level values of inflammatory cytokines in NSCLC patients receiving ICI and their early change around commencement of ICIs in predicting response to treatment and disease progression. The studies evaluated cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2, 6, 8, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 for predictability for responses to ICI. A combination cytokine panel can help predict the response and prognosis of patients with NSCLC who are receiving ICI treatment. Furthermore, a more individualized ICI treatment will be available if responses and change in tumor burden can be predicted. However, most of the studies on cytokines in NSCLC patients receiving ICIs had a small number of patients, and the heterogeneous measurement time points. Nevertheless, cytokines such as IL-8 and IFN- \u03b3 have considerable potential predictive value for immunotherapy response, which is worthy of further studies. To utilize blood cytokines levels as biomarkers for immunotherapy, a larger study with uniform measurement protocol is necessary.",

The KEYNOTE-024 study described the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated NSCLC who had a PD-L1 TPS of at least 50 %. However, patients with untreated brain metastasis (BM) were excluded from many clinical trials. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of pembrolizumab against BM of NSCLC with high tumor PD-L1 expression. We retrospectively reviewed patients who received pembrolizumab as first-line treatment against NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS\u202f\u2265\u202f50 % between March 2017 and September 2019. Treatment efficacy was compared between patients with (BM group) and without BM (non-BM group). In addition, the BM group was divided into patients who previously received treatment for BM before pembrolizumab (BM-T group) and those with no prior treatment for BM (BM-not T group). Eighty-seven patients (23 BM group and 64 non-BM group) were assessable for efficacy. No significant differences in patient characteristics were found between the BM and non-BM groups, but proportion of patients with stage IV at diagnosis was significantly higher in the BM group. Median progression-free survival (PFS) (6.5 months vs. 7.0 months) and overall survival (OS) (21.6 months vs. 24.6 months) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The response rate of BM was 70 %. The BM group was subdivided into 13 patients in the BM-T group and 10 patients in the BM-not T group. No significant differences in patient characteristics were found between the two groups, but maximum diameter of BM and proportion of patients with symptomatic BM were significantly greater in the BM-T group. PFS and OS did not significantly differ between the two groups. The median PFS of BM was 13.6 months in the BM-T group and 18.6 months in the BM-not T group.

    "abstract": "Immunohistochemical (IHC) stain for PD-L1 as a biomarker for immunotherapy is recommended in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Under the FDA, the selection of patients for pembrolizumab requires companion diagnostic testing using the Dako Agilent PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit performed on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform. However, because it is not widely available, there is need for cross-platform validation. Existing studies provide incomplete protocol detail. In our study, 73 lung tumors were stained using the FDA-approved test ('gold standard'). The same blocks were stained using two different models of the Ventana DISCOVERY platform (ULTRA, n =\u00a073 and XT, n =\u00a070) using different parameters, and interpreted by three pathologists. The ULTRA group met College of American Pathologists (CAP) validation criteria (concordance 91.8%) while the XT group did not (concordance 67.1%). Using tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651% and TPS \u226550% as cut-offs, the ULTRA protocol had higher sensitivity (97.8% and 91.7%) than XT (73.3% and 60.9%) and similar specificity (ULTRA 88.9% and 100%, XT 88% and 100%). Discordance between ULTRA and XT was 27%, and in all these cases ULTRA was concordant with gold standard. Interobserver reliability was substantial for ULTRA and almost perfect for XT, providing evidence that staining rather than observer variability accounts for XT's inferior performance. Cross-validation of the clinically used 22C3 anti PD-L1 antibody test with substantial interobserver agreement is possible on the commonly used the Ventana DISCOVERY ULTRA automated instrument, while the validation failed on the XT. Cautious attention to detail must be paid when choosing cross-validation parameters.",

However, a significant number of patients with NSCLC still fail to respond to ICB due to unfavorable tumor microenvironment. To improve the efficacy, the immune-chemotherapy combination with pemetrexed, cis/carboplatin and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) has been recently approved as first-line treatment in advanced NSCLCs. While chemotherapeutic agents exert beneficial effects, the underlying antitumor mechanism(s) remains unclear. Pemetrexed, cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic agents were tested for the potential to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. The ability to prime the tumor immune microenvironment was then determined by NSCLC/T cell coculture systems and syngeneic mouse models. Subpopulations of NSCLC cells responding differently to pemetrexed were selected and subjected to RNA-sequencing analysis. The key signaling pathways were identified and validated in vitro and in vivo. Pemetrexed induced the transcriptional activation of  Our findings reveal novel mechanisms showing that pemetrexed upregulates PD-L1 expression and primes a favorable microenvironment for ICB, which provides a mechanistic basis for the combinatory chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the patients who may benefit the most from immune checkpoints inhibitors remains a great challenge for clinicians. Here we investigate on blood serum amyloid A (SAA) as biomarker of response to upfront pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with PD-L1\u2009\u2265\u200950% receiving upfront pembrolizumab (P cohort) and with PD-L1 0-49% treated with chemotherapy (CT cohort) were evaluated for blood SAA and radiological response at baseline and every 9\u00a0weeks. Endpoints were response rate (RR) according to RECIST1.1, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The most accurate SAA cut-off to predict response was established with ROC analysis in the P cohort. In the P Cohort (n\u2009=\u200942), the overall RR was 38%. After a median follow-up of 18.5\u00a0months (mo), baseline SAA\u2009\u2264\u2009the ROC-derived cut-off (29.9\u00a0mg/L; n\u2009=\u200928/42.67%) was significantly associated with higher RR (53.6 versus 7.1%; OR15, 95% CI 1.72-130.7, p\u2009=\u20090.009), longer PFS (17.4 versus 2.1 mo; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and OS (not reached versus 7.2mo; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared with SAA\u2009>\u200929.9\u00a0mg/L. In multivariate analysis, low SAA positively affects PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and OS (p\u2009=\u20090.048) irrespective of ECOG PS, number of metastatic sites and pleural effusion. SAA monitoring (n\u2009=\u200940) was also significantly associated with survival endpoints: median PFS 17.4 versus 2.1 mo and median OS not reached versus 7.2 mo when SAA remained low (n\u2009=\u200914) and high (n\u2009=\u200912), respectively. In the CT Cohort (n\u2009=\u200930), RR was not affected by SAA level (p\u2009>\u20090.05) while low SAA at baseline (n\u2009=\u200917) was associated with better PFS (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.90, p\u2009=\u20090.006) and OS (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.67, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Low SAA predicts good survival outcomes irrespective of treatment for advanced NSCLC patients and higher likelihood of response to upfront pembrolizumab only. The strong prognostic value might be exploited to easily identify patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. A further study (FoRECATT-2) is ongoing to confirm results in a larger sample size and to investigate the effect of SAA on immune response in vitro assays.",

We present results from patients in KEYNOTE-042 enrolled from China in the global or extension study (NCT03850444; protocol identical to global study). Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by ECOG performance status 0 vs 1, squamous vs nonsquamous histology and PD-L1 tumor proportion score [TPS] \u226550% vs 1%-49%) to 35\u2009cycles of pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg every 3\u2009weeks (Q3W) or investigator's choice of 4 to 6 cycles of carboplatin plus paclitaxel or pemetrexed Q3W with optional pemetrexed maintenance for nonsquamous tumors. Primary endpoints were OS in patients with PD-L1 TPS \u226550%, \u226520% or \u22651%. Two hundred sixty-two patients (pembrolizumab, n = 128; chemotherapy, n = 134) were enrolled from China. At data cutoff (February 21, 2020; median follow-up, 33.0 [range, 25.6-41.9] months), pembrolizumab was shown to improve OS vs chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 TPS \u226550% (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.63 [0.43-0.94]), TPS \u226520% (0.66 [0.47-0.92]) and TPS \u22651% (0.67 [0.50-0.89]). Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred less frequently with pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy (19.5% vs 68.8%). In 22 patients who completed 35\u2009cycles of pembrolizumab, objective response rate was 77.3% and median duration of response was 27.6 months. Consistent with the global KEYNOTE-042 study, pembrolizumab improved OS vs chemotherapy in this study of Chinese patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS \u22651%, supporting first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for PD-L1-positive advanced/metastatic NSCLC in China.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody, underwent a rapid clinical development program for the treatment of patients with malignancies in parallel to the development of a companion diagnostic for detecting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which was considered to be a likely biomarker for response and cancer outcome. When investigating outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab, PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) was initially identified as a marker of clinical efficacy, with a cutoff of \u2265\u200950%. This threshold was later reduced to TPS \u2265\u20091%, which demonstrated that pembrolizumab offered a clinical benefit in a broader population of patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors. As new evidence emerged, it also became clear that immune cell PD-L1 expression has an important role in predicting tumor response in patients treated with pembrolizumab; the combined positive score (CPS), which accounts for both tumor and immune cell PD-L1 expression, was then applied in clinical studies for indications outside of NSCLC. This review summarizes the outcomes of landmark studies in the KEYNOTE clinical development program that investigated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with a variety of malignancies, the relative outcomes when patients were stratified by PD-L1 status, and how these observations have influenced the approved indications for pembrolizumab.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improve outcomes in newly diagnosed metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to evaluate the economic outcomes of first-line treatment by adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with and without the use of PD-L1 testing for patient selection. A decision-analytic model was adopted to project the disease course of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations. The efficacy and toxicity data were gathered from the KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 trials. Transition probabilities were estimated from the reported survival probabilities in each group. Cost and health preference data were derived from published economic evaluations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured, and subgroup, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed for exploring the model uncertainties. In the US context, pembrolizumab\u2005plus\u2005chemotherapy is projected to increase quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) by 1.168 and 0.988 in comparison with\u2005chemotherapy and the ICERs were $122,248 and $121,375/QALY in the whole nonsquamous and squamous patients with unconfirmed PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS), respectively. After the selection of patients by PD-L1 TPS by PD-L1 testing, the ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for patients with confirmed PD-L1 TPS >1% and \u226550% were $143,282 and $127,661/QALY in nonsquamous disease, and $131,495 and $121,554/QALY in squamous disease, respectively. The ICERs of adding pembrolizumab treatment for Chinese patients were higher than $40,000/QALY regardless of the histology and TPS subgroups, which highly exceed the willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,196/QALY (three times of per capita gross domestic product of China in 2018) in China. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for untreated metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations is a cost-effective option regardless of PD-L1 expression status in the US context, and not cost-effective in the Chinese context. However, PD-L1 categories-directed pembrolizumab could not increase the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy.",

Here, we encountered an elderly patient who showed complete response of NSCLC following treatment with pembrolizumab. An 84-year-old man with a history of bloody sputum for several weeks visited a general physician. At that time, a chest X-ray revealed a tumor shadow in the left middle lung field, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Following transbronchial biopsy, he was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells was 80% or more by immunostaining. Based on the above, immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was performed as first-line therapy. The cancer cells completely disappeared at the end of the fifth cycle. There were no side effects during the therapeutic course. Treatment with pembrolizumab continued for two years and was then discontinued at the patient's request. Since then, no tumor recurrence has been detected for about one and a half years without treatment. There have been few reports of lung cancer disappearing after treatment with pembrolizumab. In conclusion, in elderly NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of 50% or more, pembrolizumab should be considered as first-line treatment with the treatment period, and mechanism suggested in this report.",

    "title": "PD-L1 versus tumor mutation burden: Which is the better immunotherapy biomarker in advanced non-small cell lung cancer?",
    "abstract": "PD-L1 and tumor mutation burden (TMB) are the most widely used immunotherapy biomarkers to identify populations who would attain clinical benefit, with the higher values predicting better therapeutic efficacy. This review addresses the predictive values and unresolved challenges of these two biomarkers. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have induced durable and effective responses in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, confirmed by multiple clinical trials and real-world studies. Different clinical trials, involving both PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone and combination regimens, adopted either PD-L1 or TMB to stratify the patients, although the predictive capabilities of these two biomarkers are different. In the first-line setting, PD-L1 of 50% or more as a cut-off value can help select candidates for pembrolizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy; however, these two biomarkers poorly predict the efficacy of immunotherapy combination regimens as first-line treatments. In the second-line setting, although patients can benefit from nivolumab regardless of PD-L1 expression, both PD-L1 and blood TMB can be used as biomarkers to find patients suitable for atezolizumab. Except for inaccurate predictiveness, there are many unresolved problems with regard to the two biomarkers, such as the lack of standard detection methods, and their susceptibilities to other dynamic changes. The predictive values of TMB and PD-L1 were low in most circumstances; however, PD-L1 expression greater than \u2265 50% can help select appropriate patients for pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, respectively, as first-line monotherapies. Higher PD-L1 or TMB was associated with greater efficacy for atezolizumab as a second-line monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Real-world data have suggested a detrimental effect of steroid use in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving immunotherapy. However, previous studies included heterogeneous cohorts of patients receiving different lines of treatment with several immuno-oncology agents and various combinations of chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. A comprehensive clinicopathologic database of patients with NSCLC and programmed cell death ligand 1 >50% treated with frontline pembrolizumab monotherapy was constructed in 14 centers in Italy, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland. A multivariate analysis adjusting for the established prognostic factors was performed using a Cox regression model. For the 265 eligible patients, the median age at diagnosis was 67 years, 66% were male, 90% were current or former smokers, 18% had had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or 3. Of the NSCLC subtypes, 64% were adenocarcinoma and 25% were squamous cell. Of the patients, 18% had had brain metastases at diagnosis and 24% had received steroids before or during pembrolizumab treatment. The median time to progression was 4.4 months with and 13.7 months without steroid use (hazard ratio [HR], 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-3.85; log-rank P\u00a0< .001). The median survival was 22.5 months for the whole cohort, 7.7 months for the steroid group, and not reached for the non-steroid group (HR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.34-5.68; log-rank P\u00a0< .001). On multivariate analysis accounting for all established prognostic variables, steroid use was still independently associated with a high risk of progression (HR, 1.864; 95% CI, 1.179-2.949; P\u00a0= .008) and death (HR, 2.292; 95% CI, 1.441-3.644; P\u00a0< .001) CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced NSCLC and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression > 50% receiving frontline pembrolizumab monotherapy, any use of steroids before or during treatment was associated with an 86% increase in the risk of progression and a 2.3-fold increase in the risk of death, even accounting for palliative indication-related bias, including the presence of central nervous system metastasis. The use of steroids for palliative indications should be restricted to absolutely necessary for patients receiving immuno-oncology monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Within the past decade, immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab have shown superiority over chemotherapy regimens in patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Several predictive molecular biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden, have shown utility in discovering lung cancer patient groups that would benefit from ICIs. However, there remains to be a reliable imaging biomarker that would clearly select patients, through baseline or restaging imaging, who would respond or have a prolonged response to ICIs. The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC and past or current studies in potential biomarkers as well as future directions on the role of imaging in immunotherapy.",

A previous retrospective study of patients with metastatic melanoma (treated mostly with anti-CTLA4 antibodies) reported a serious infection rate of 7.3%. The main risk factors were corticoids and infliximab use. We sought to describe infections and risk factors among patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs. We reviewed 200 medical records sampled randomly from a French prospective registry, which collates patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs. We recorded demographic data, the occurrence of irAEs, immunosuppressant use, and the outcome. Thirty-six patients (18%) experienced an infection by a median (interquartile range) of 47 (19.2-132) days after initiation of the ICI. Twenty-one patients (58.3%) had a lung infection, seven (19.4%) had a skin infection, seven (19.4%) had a urinary tract infection, and all of them received antibiotics. The infection was generally mild, and the patients were treated as outpatient. There were no infection-related deaths\u00a0and no opportunistic infection. Sixty percent of the patients were being treated for metastatic melanoma and 35.5% for non-small cell lung cancer, and 106 irAEs (mostly grade II) were reported. Forty-seven patients received steroids for cancer symptoms or irAEs, and five received immunosuppressants during the immunotherapy. We did not observe any association between corticosteroid or immunosuppressant use and the occurrence of an infection. The infection rate in patients treated with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ICI was 18%, without any severe or opportunistic infection. The occurrence of an infection was not associated with corticosteroid or immunosuppressant use.",

    "abstract": "The Lung Cancer Master Protocol (Lung-MAP; S1400) is a completed biomarker-driven master protocol designed to address an unmet need for better therapies for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Lung-MAP (S1400) was created to establish an infrastructure for biomarker screening and rapid regulatory intent evaluation of targeted therapies and was the first biomarker-driven master protocol initiated with the US National Cancer Institute (NCI). Lung-MAP (S1400) was done within the National Clinical Trials Network of the NCI using a public-private partnership. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had stage IV or recurrent squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, had previously been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. The study included a screening component using the FoundationOne assay (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA) for next-generation sequencing, and a clinical trial component with biomarker-driven substudies and non-match substudies for patients who were ineligible for biomarker-driven substudies. Patients were pre-screened and received their substudy assignment upon progression, or they were screened at progression and received their substudy assignment upon completion of testing. Patients could enrol onto additional substudies after progression on a substudy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02154490, and all research related to Lung-MAP (S1400) is completed. Between June 16, 2014, and Jan 28, 2019, 1864 patients enrolled and 1841 (98\u00b79%) submitted tissue. 1674 (90\u00b79%) of 1841 patients had biomarker results, and 1404 (83\u00b79%) of 1674 patients received a substudy assignment. Of the assigned patients, 655 (46\u00b77%) registered to a substudy. The biomarker-driven substudies evaluated taselisib (targeting PIK3CA alterations), palbociclib (cell cycle gene alterations), AZD4547 (FGFR alteration), rilotumumab plus erlotinib (MET), talazoparib (homologous recombination repair deficiency), and telisotuzumab vedotin (MET). The non-match substudies evaluated durvalumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab for anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-naive disease, and durvalumab plus tremelimumab for anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 relapsed disease. Combining data from the substudies, ten (7\u00b70%) of 143 patients responded to targeted therapy, 53 (16\u00b78%) of 315 patients responded to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for immunotherapy-naive disease, and three (5\u00b74%) of 56 responded to docetaxel in the second line of therapy. Median overall survival was 5\u00b79 months (95% CI 4\u00b78-7\u00b78) for the targeted therapy groups, 7\u00b77 months (6\u00b77-9\u00b72) for the docetaxel groups, and 10\u00b78 months (9\u00b74-12\u00b73) for the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-containing groups. Median progression-free survival was 2\u00b75 months (95% CI 1\u00b77-2\u00b78) for the targeted therapy groups, 2\u00b77 months (1\u00b79-2\u00b79) for the docetaxel groups, and 3\u00b70 months (2\u00b77-3\u00b79) for the anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-containing groups. Lung-MAP (S1400) met its goal to quickly address biomarker-driven therapy questions in squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. In early 2019, a new screening protocol was implemented expanding to all histological types of non-small-cell lung cancer and to add focus on immunotherapy combinations for anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapy-relapsed disease. With these changes, Lung-MAP continues to meet its goal to focus on unmet needs in the treatment of advanced lung cancers.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Most of these patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, and thus decrease the 5-year survival rate to about 5%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can act on the inhibitory pathway of cancer immune response, thereby restoring and maintaining anti-tumor immunity. There are already ICIs targeting different pathways, including the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway. Since March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) as the second-line option for treatment of patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. Additionally, a series of inhibitors related to PD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoints have helped in the immunotherapy of NSCLC patients, and modified the original treatment model. However, controversies remain regarding the use of ICIs in a subgroup with targeted oncogene mutations is a problem that we need to solve. On the other hand, there are continuous efforts to find biomarkers that effectively predict the response of ICIs to screen suitable populations. In this review, we have reviewed the history of the continuous developments in cancer immunotherapy, summarized the mechanism of action of the immune-checkpoint pathways. Finally, based on the results of the first-line recent trials, we propose a potential first-line immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of the patients with NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to have soluble forms aside from its membrane-bound forms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive and prognostic values of serum soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with anti-PD-1 antibody. A total of 233 patients were enrolled in this study. We assessed the level of serum sPD-L1 before anti-PD-1 antibody treatment (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) and evaluated the correlation with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, the response to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment, and patient outcome. The median serum sPD-L1 concentration was 67.7 (range, 25 to 223) pg/mL. A weak correlation between serum sPD-L1 and tumor PD-L1 expression was observed. The disease control rate in the high sPD-L1 group (\u226590\u2009pg/mL) was significantly lower than that in the low sPD-L1 group (<90\u2009pg/mL) (37% vs. 57%, P = 0.0158). The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the high sPD-L1 group were significantly shorter than those in the low sPD-L1 group (median PFS, 57\u2009days vs. 177\u2009days, P = 0.011; median OS, 182\u2009days vs. not reached, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The high level of serum sPD-L1 was independently associated with a shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.910; P = 0.061) and OS (HR, 2.073; P = 0.034) in multivariate analysis. The serum sPD-L1 level, which was only weakly correlated with the tumor PD-L1 expression level, was an independent predictive and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibody. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The disease control rate in the high sPD-L1 group was significantly lower than that in the low sPD-L1 group. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the high sPD-L1 group were significantly shorter than those in the low sPD-L1 group. The high level of serum sPD-L1 was independently associated with a shorter PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. This study demonstrated that serum sPD-L1 level was an independent predictive and prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibody.",

A 66-year-old man was presented with weight loss and cough for 3 months. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed a mass in the superior anterior mediastinum and multiple enlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes. Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed abnormal uptake in the corresponding lesions. Histopathological analysis of the left axillary nodule revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and thyroid transcription factor-1 and negative for cytokeratin 20. Thus, the patient was diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, and treated as non-small-cell lung cancer. Additional genetic testing revealed the patient was negative for EGFR, ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization, ROS1, BRAF, and PD-L1 22C3 IHC with Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) was less than 1%. The patient received six cycles of pembrolizumab, platinum, and pemetrexed intravenously. Cisplatin was switched to carboplatin because of cisplatin nephrotoxicity in one course. PET-CT after six cycles showed all lesions disappeared; complete response was considered to have been achieved. Maintenance therapy of pembrolizumab and pemetrexed has been continued for 6 months after the induction therapies to prevent progressive disease. Complete response has been maintained. Chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, platinum and pemetrexed could be valuable for treating unfavorable CUP. Chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, platinum, and pemetrexed helped achieved sustained complete response in a patient with unfavorable CUP.",

    "title": "Pembrolizumab with or without radiotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials.",
    "abstract": "Radiotherapy might augment systemic antitumoral responses to immunotherapy. In the PEMBRO-RT (phase 2) and MDACC (phase 1/2) trials, patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly allocated immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) with or without radiotherapy. When the trials were analysed individually, a potential benefit was noted in the combination treatment arm. However, owing to the small sample size of each trial, differences in response rates and outcomes were not statistically significant but remained clinically notable. We therefore did a pooled analysis to infer whether radiotherapy improves responses to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Inclusion criteria for the PEMBRO-RT and MDACC trials were patients (aged \u226518 years) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and at least one unirradiated lesion to monitor for out-of-field response. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients had previously received chemotherapy, whereas in the MDACC trial, patients could be either previously treated or newly diagnosed. Patients in both trials were immunotherapy-naive. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by smoking status (<10 vs \u226510 pack-years). In the MDACC trial, patients were entered into one of two cohorts based on radiotherapy schedule feasibility and randomly assigned (1:1). Because of the nature of the intervention in the combination treatment arm, blinding to radiotherapy was not feasible in either trial. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without radiotherapy in both trials. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, the first dose of pembrolizumab was given sequentially less than 1 week after the last dose of radiotherapy (24 Gy in three fractions), whereas in the MDACC trial, pembrolizumab was given concurrently with the first dose of radiotherapy (50 Gy in four fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). Only unirradiated lesions were measured for response. The endpoints for this pooled analysis were best out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ARR), best abscopal disease control rate (ACR), ARR at 12 weeks, ACR at 12 weeks, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The intention-to-treat populations from both trials were included in analyses. The PEMBRO-RT trial (NCT02492568) and the MDACC trial (NCT02444741) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Overall, 148 patients were included in the pooled analysis, 76 of whom had been assigned pembrolizumab and 72 who had been assigned pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up for all patients was 33 months (IQR 32\u00b74-33\u00b76). 124 (84%) of 148 patients had non-squamous histological features and 111 (75%) had previously received chemotherapy. Baseline variables did not differ between treatment groups, including PD-L1 status and metastatic disease volume. The most frequently irradiated sites were lung metastases (28 of 72 [39%]), intrathoracic lymph nodes (15 of 72 [21%]), and lung primary disease (12 of 72 [17%]). Best ARR was 19\u00b77% (15 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 41\u00b77% (30 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 2\u00b796, 95% CI 1\u00b742-6\u00b720; p=0\u00b70039), and best ACR was 43\u00b74% (33 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 65\u00b73% (47 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (2\u00b751, 1\u00b728-4\u00b791; p=0\u00b70071). Median progression-free survival was 4\u00b74 months (IQR 2\u00b79-5\u00b79) with pembrolizumab alone versus 9\u00b70 months (6\u00b78-11\u00b72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b745-0\u00b799; p=0\u00b7045), and median overall survival was 8\u00b77 months (6\u00b74-11\u00b70) with pembrolizumab versus 19\u00b72 months (14\u00b76-23\u00b78) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (0\u00b767, 0\u00b754-0\u00b784; p=0\u00b70004). No new safety concerns were noted in the pooled analysis. Adding radiotherapy to pembrolizumab immunotherapy significantly increased responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. These results warrant validation in a randomised phase 3 trial. Merck Sharp & Dohme.",

    "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is the standard first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression tumor proportion score (TPS) \u226550%. The benefit of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC and poor performance status (PS \u22653) is limited, even when the tumor is PD-L1-expression-positive. We retrospectively reviewed a total of four NSCLC cases with high PD-L1 expression (TPS \u226550%) and poor PS. The only patient with very high PD-L1 expression (TPS 100%) responded to pembrolizumab, but none of the three patients with high PD-L1 expression (50%-80%) responded to pembrolizumab. In conclusion, pembrolizumab can serve as a treatment option for patients with poor PS, if PD-L1 expression TPS is 100%.",

We present the outcomes analysis according to baseline body mass index (BMI) and BMI variation in a large cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 expression \u226550%, receiving first line pembrolizumab. We also evaluated a control cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients treated with first line platinum-based chemotherapy. Normal weight was set as control group. 962 patients and 426 patients were included in the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy cohorts, respectively. Obese patients had a significantly higher objective response rate (ORR) (OR=1.61 (95% CI: 1.04-2.50)) in the pembrolizumab cohort, while overweight patients had a significantly lower ORR (OR=0.59 (95% CI: 0.37-0.92)) within the chemotherapy cohort. Obese patients had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (HR=0.61 (95% CI: 0.45-0.82)) in the pembrolizumab cohort. Conversely, they had a significantly shorter PFS in the chemotherapy cohort (HR=1.27 (95% CI: 1.01-1.60)). Obese patients had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) within the pembrolizumab cohort (HR=0.70 (95% CI: 0.49-0.99)), while no significant differences according to baseline BMI were found in the chemotherapy cohort. BMI variation significantly affected ORR, PFS and OS in both the pembrolizumab and the chemotherapy cohorts. Baseline obesity is associated to significantly improved ORR, PFS and OS in metastatic NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 expression of \u226550%, receiving first line pembrolizumab, but not among patients treated with chemotherapy. BMI variation is also significantly related to clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and their ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) have become widely used in the treatment of several malignancies. Many immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been linked to these agents. Nonetheless, tuberculosis (TB) reactivation during their use is increasingly recognized and reported. Herein, we present a 58-year-old lady with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ALK-negative, EGFR wild, and PD-L1 immune histochemistry (IHC) strongly positive in 95% of tumor cells, on ongoing treatment with Pembrolizumab as a first-line monotherapy. Our patient presented with 1-week history of productive cough and high-grade fever. Further workup yielded the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis after her Pembrolizumab sixth cycle with positive AFB smear and TB PCR from BAL (rifampin resistance not detected), with negative HIV status. Hence, immunotherapy was held, and patient was commenced on anti-TB regimen. History revealed contact with active TB patient over the past decade, without previous documentation of latent TB or previous TB infection. Her sputum AFB smear remained persistently positive 4\u00a0weeks through anti-TB regimen course. Later, the patient was discharged after her sputum was cleared from AFB (two negative sets). In light of pembrolizumab mechanism of action as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, we suspected its implication on reactivating latent TB which was observed in our patient demonstrating features of pulmonary tuberculosis. She was not re-challenged with Pembrolizumab following TB diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Data of first-line ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab treatment of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive NSCLC (cohort E) are reported (NCT02443324). In this multicenter, open-label phase 1a/b trial, patients received ramucirumab 10 mg/kg and pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21 days for up to 35 cycles. PD-L1 positivity was defined as tumor proportion score (TPS) greater than or equal to 1%. Exploratory NanoString biomarker analyses included three T-cell signatures (T-cell-inflamed, Gajewski, and effector T cells) and CD274 gene expression. Cohort E included 26 patients. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 22 patients (84.6%). Treatment-related adverse events of grade greater than or equal to 3 were reported in 11 patients (42.3%); the most frequent was hypertension (n\u00a0= 4, 15.4%). Objective response rate was 42.3% in the treated population and 56.3% and 22.2% for patients with high (TPS \u2265 50%) and lower levels (TPS 1%-49%) of PD-L1 expression, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) in the treated population was 9.3 months, and 12-month and 18-month PFS rates were 45% each. Median PFS was not reached in patients with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50% and was 4.2 months in patients with PD-L1 TPS 1% to 49%. Median overall survival was not reached in the treated population, and 12-month and 18-month overall survival rates were 73% and 64%, respectively. Biomarker data suggested a positive association among clinical response, three T-cell signatures, CD274 gene expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. First-line therapy with ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab has a manageable safety profile in patients with NSCLC, and the efficacy signal seems to be strongest in tumors with high PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "In this phase I/II trial, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab, with or without concurrent radiotherapy (RT), for lung and liver lesions from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Patients with lung or liver lesions amenable to RT plus at least one additional non-contiguous lesion were included regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. Pembrolizumab was given at 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 32 cycles with or without concurrent RT. Metastatic lesions were treated with stereotactic body RT (SBRT; 50 Gy in 4 fractions) if clinically feasible or with traditionally fractionated RT (45 Gy in 15 fractions) if not. The primary end point was the best out-of-field lesion response, and a key secondary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The median follow-up time was 20.4 months. One hundred patients (20 phase I, 80 phase II) were evaluable for toxicity, and 72 phase II patients were evaluable for treatment response. No patients in the phase I group experienced grade 4-5 events; in the phase II group, two had grade 4 events and nine had grade 3 events. The ORR in the combined-modality cohort (irrespective of RT schema) was 22%, vs 25% in the pembrolizumab group (irrespective of receipt of salvage RT) (p=0.99). In the concurrent pembrolizumab+RT groups, the out-of-field ORRs were 38% in the pembrolizumab+SBRT group and 10% in the pembrolizumab+traditional RT group. When examining the pembrolizumab-alone patients, the out-of-field ORRs were 33% in those designated to receive salvage SBRT (if required) and 17% for salvage traditional RT. In all patients, the median PFS for pembrolizumab alone was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.4 to 12.7 months), and pembrolizumab/RT (regardless of schema) was 9.1 months (95% CI 3.6 to 18.4 months) (p=0.52). An exploratory analysis revealed that for patients with low PD-L1 expression, the median PFS was 4.6 vs 20.8 months for pembrolizumab with and without RT, respectively (p=0.004). Concurrent immunoradiotherapy for mNSCLC is safe, although larger trials are required to address which patients benefit most from RT. NCT02444741.",
