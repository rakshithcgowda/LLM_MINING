    "abstract": "We present a 34-year-old woman diagnosed with primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the bladder, confirmed after transurethral resection. Two years postinitial diagnosis, despite chemotherapy, she developed pulmonary and skeletal metastases, leading to progressive symptoms including cough, hemoptysis and refractory bone pain. She was evaluated via 99mTc-FAPI-46 scintigraphy, which showed significant uptake in metastatic lesions, suggesting suitability for radio-ligand therapy. However, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she passed away before treatment could be initiated. This case underscores the sensitivity of FAPI-targeted imaging in mucinous adenocarcinoma of the bladder and highlights the need for further investigation into its therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "The use of metal oxide nanoparticles as anticancer agents is of great interest due to their unique properties that allow targeted delivery at low concentrations with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. In this work, CdO-CuO-ZnO mixed metal oxide nanocomposites were synthesized by the co-precipitation method, and their structural and optical properties, along with their anticancer activity, were investigated. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), UV-Vis spectroscopy, electrometer/high resistance material, and vibrating sample magnetometers (VSM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that CdO exhibits a cubic structure, CuO possesses a monoclinic structure, ZnO displays a hexagonal structure, and the mixture showed peaks corresponding to all three oxides. TEM images revealed that the prepared nanoparticles have quasi-spherical shapes. Anticancer studies confirmed that the CdO-CuO-ZnO nanocomposite demonstrates excellent cytotoxicity, with moderate activity against human colon (Caco-2) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines, exhibiting IC50\u00a0values of 10.57\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 6.61 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Our study shows that the prepared CdO-CuO-ZnO nanocomposite has massive potential in cancer therapy.",

Traditional methods to identify BRAF hotspot mutations and MLH1 methylation are insufficient in clinical practice. This study aims to explore the WNT pathway alterations in the CRC and to develop a WNT-derived subtyping model to identify SCC patients by using multi-OMICs data. We included multi-omics data of 1751 colorectal cancer patients from the TCGA and GEO databases, and single-cell transcriptome data of 33 normal and cancer tissues from the SMC study cohort. The comprehensive study process incorporated unsupervised clustering, enrichment analysis, and statistical analysis. In this study, we investigated WNT pathway alterations in SCC by integrating both bulk and single-cell data into the multi-OMICs framework. The SCC subtype demonstrated significant WNT pathway heterogeneity and a more stable genomic structure. These findings support the development of a WNT-derived subtyping model that accurately identifies SCC patients across different CRC cohorts. In addition, the SCC subtype also presented a distinct immune microenvironment characterized by CD8 We developed a WNT-derived subtyping method to identify SCC from canonical CRC, which enhances the molecular understanding of this severe cancer subtype and provides potential therapeutic strategies. Our findings suggest that SCC patients may benefit from the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, highlighting its potential as a targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of prognostic models to predict the outcomes of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients receiving Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy. Existing nutritional risk indicators, such as the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and Naples prognostic score (NPS), have demonstrated prognostic value in various malignancies. This study aimed to construct novel nutritional risk indexes (NRIs) using peripheral blood markers via Lasso-Cox regression and validate their prognostic value. The electric medical records in our institution were searched and data of 525 NMIBC patients were collected. The Lasso-Cox regression was employed to screen preoperative blood biomarkers correlated with recurrence-free survival (RFS), time to BCG-treatment failure (TTF), and progression-free survival (PFS). NRIs were developed based on selected markers and validated against GNRI, PNI, NPS, and the EAU2021 risk model using Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Concordance index (C-index) and Decision Curve analysis. Lasso-Cox regression identified distinct blood biomarkers: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), serum total protein (TP), albumin and cholesterol were predictive of tumor recurrence and BCG failure, while GGT, TP, and coefficient variation of red blood cell volume distribution width were linked to tumor progression. Three NRIs-NRITR (RFS), NRIBF (TTF) and NRITP (PFS)-were constructed. The NRIs exhibited prognostic value through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed NRITR (HR\u202f=\u202f0.38, 95%CI:0.28-0.53), NRIBF (HR\u202f=\u202f0.45, 95%CI: 0.30-0.67), and NRITP (HR\u202f=\u202f0.38, 95%CI: 0.21-0.69) as independent predictors. Nomograms incorporating NRIs demonstrated superior discriminative performance in predicting RFS (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.739, C-index\u202f=\u202f0.673), TTF (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.795, C-index\u202f=\u202f0.767), and PFS (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.796, C-index\u202f=\u202f0.788), and could bring more net benefit for NMIBC patients. The Lasso-Cox regression may offer superior value in selecting prognostic biomarkers for NMIBC. The Lasso-Cox regression based NRIs enhance prognostic stratification for BCG-treated NMIBC, outperforming existing blood-based nutritional risk indicators and the EAU2021 model. Incorporation of blood-based nutritional indicators into clinical practice could optimization of personalized NMIBC treatment strategies and clinical decision-making. Further validation is warranted.",

Finally, we conducted  Results indicate that SF3B6 was highly expressed in various cancers and regulated by copy number variations and DNA methylation. The elevated expression of SF3B6 demonstrated predictive value for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and responses to immunotherapy. Functional enrichment analysis suggests that SF3B6 was closely associated with pathways related to tumor immunity, tumor metabolism, and cell cycle. Additionally, high SF3B6 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival and correlated with poor alpha-fetoprotein levels, pathological grading, clinical staging, and reduced responses to sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization treatment in HCC. Interestingly, SF3B6 was associated with variant splicing isotypes of genes involved in the G2M checkpoint and DNA repair pathways, including NEIL3, NEK2, KIF4A, TROAP, and FANCD2. Moreover, SF3B6 was highly expressed in liver cancer cells, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, inhibiting apoptosis, and regulating the transition from the S phase to the G2M phase of the cell cycle. We emphasize that SF3B6 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for predicting cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy responses, especially in HCC.

However, the status of CD8+ T cells in endometrial cancer and the key genes influencing their activation still remain to be elucidated. Genes associated with the activation of CD8+ T cells were identified through differential analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A risk score model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression. The clinical characteristics and differences between the high-risk group and the low-risk group were explored, and the applicability of the model to chemotherapy, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors was evaluated. The characteristics of the model at the single-cell level were studied, and the tumor-suppressive effect of ASB2 was verified through experiments on endometrial cancer cells. A risk model based on genes related to the activation of CD8+ T cells was constructed, and the prognostic differences were verified using the Kaplan-Meier curve. A nomogram was designed to predict the survival probability. Pathway analysis showed that it was related to metabolism and DNA repair. There were significant differences between the high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of tumor mutational burden (TMB), checkpoint molecules, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and they had different sensitivities to different therapies. The tumor-suppressive effect of ASB2 was confirmed in experiments on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. This study provides a predictive tool for endometrial cancer.

Therapeutic strategies targeting glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and some other key signaling have shown promise in mitigating immune hyperactivation and inflammation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer (PC) are increasing year by year. The highly heterogeneous nature of PC, its strong immune escape ability and easy metastasis make it the most lethal malignant tumor in the world. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, the complex components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PC have been gradually revealed. Interactions between pancreatic stellate cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, various types of immune cells, and cancer cells collectively promote metabolic reprogramming of all types of cells. This metabolic reprogramming further enhances the immune escape mechanism of tumor cells and ultimately induces tumor cells to become severely resistant to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. On the one hand, PC cells achieve re and rational utilization of glucose, amino acids and lipids through metabolic reprogramming, which in turn accomplishes biosynthesis and energy metabolism requirements. Under such conditions, tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis are ultimately promoted. On the other hand, various types of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) also undergo metabolic reprogramming, which leads to tumor progression and suppression of anti-immune responses by inhibiting the function of normal anti-tumor immune cells and enhancing the function of immunosuppressive cells. The aim of this review is to explore the interaction between the immune microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming in PC. The focus is to summarize the specific mechanisms of action of metabolic reprogramming of PC cells and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells. In addition, this review will summarize the mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in PC cells. In the future, targeting specific mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming will provide a solid theoretical basis for the development of combination therapies for PC.",

    "abstract": "K-ras mutant lung adenocarcinoma (KM-LUAD) is a difficult-to-treat cancer subtype in which chronic inflammation pervades the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Pro-inflammatory pathways dampen the response to treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, necessitating therapies that target this inflammatory signaling network in the TIME. One of the lynchpins of chronic inflammation in KM-LUAD is signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Here, we tested the anti-tumor and early immunotherapeutic efficacy of TTI-101, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of canonical STAT3 signaling, in a K-ras Treatment of CC-LR mice with TTI-101 resulted in reduced tumor burden while increasing dendritic cell (DC) and T helper 1 (Th1) infiltration into the TIME. TTI-101 treatment decreased pY-STAT3 expression in tumors with accompanying increases in several NF-\u03baB anti-tumor target genes including CXCL9, a chemokine for primed T cells. Transcriptional profiling of the TIME revealed improved immune activation and anti-tumor skewing, as well as B cell signaling enrichment. Analysis of human LUAD data demonstrated negative correlations between  Our results highlight the importance of STAT3 in driving early tumorigenesis and offer a preventative treatment window for high-risk individuals and patients with early-stage KM-LUAD.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) have emerged as a powerful strategy to cancer treatment. However, while demonstrating antitumor efficacy, they can also induce a range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Immune-related thyroid dysfunction is one of the most common irAEs. This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and identify potential risk factors associated with PD-1 inhibitor-induced immune-related thyroid dysfunction in real-world. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors at Weifang People's Hospital from January 2021 to December 2024. The incidence, clinical subtypes, onset time, and prognostic outcomes of thyroid dysfunction were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. 119 patients of PD-1 inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction were identified. The overall incidence of thyroid dysfunction was 2.97%, with hypothyroidism occurring in 1.20%, hyperthyroidism in 1.77%, and thyroiditis in 0.50% of patients. Tislelizumab exhibited the highest incidence at 3.48%, followed by camrelizumab at 3.10%, sintilimab at 2.24%, and toripalimab at 1.75%. The median time from the initiation of immunotherapy to the onset of thyroid dysfunction was 67 days, with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism developing at median times of 64.5 and 69 days, respectively. 77.31% of cases occurred within the first four months of immunotherapy. Female gender, lower baseline FT3 levels, history of targeted therapy, and baseline TgAb positivity were identified as independent risk factors for PD-1 inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, higher baseline TSH levels, younger age, and treatment with tislelizumab or camrelizumab were associated with an increased risk of immune-related hypothyroidism, whereas lower baseline TSH levels were linked to a higher risk of immune-related hyperthyroidism. Close clinical and hormonal monitoring is recommended for patients with high-risk factors before and throughout the course of immunotherapy, particularly during the initial 2 to 4 months of PD-1 inhibitor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Solid tumours possess a hypoxic and immunosuppressive microenvironment, presenting a significant challenge to anticancer treatments. Certain anaerobic microorganisms thrive in this setting, rendering them promising candidates for targeted antitumour therapy delivery. In contrast to traditional nanodrug delivery systems, bacterial-based drug delivery systems can be engineered to produce and secrete therapeutics without the need for intricate post-purification or protective delivery methods. Nevertheless, bacteria can potentially migrate beyond their intended niche, causing off-target drug release and substantial toxicity to healthy tissues. Consequently, to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments while minimizing side effects, it is essential to precisely manipulate bacteria for accurate and controlled drug delivery directly to the tumour site. This can be achieved by employing inducible or repressible systems that allow for precise regulation of gene expression at specific times and locations. Ideally, engineering bacteria capable of rapidly and precisely transitioning between \"on\" and \"off\" states as required will enable them to recognize and react to targeted stimuli. While various techniques such as optical, magnetic, acoustic, and hyperbaric oxygen micromanipulation have been developed for the manipulation of particles or cells, each technique boasts its unique set of pros and cons. This review article provides an updated overview of the recent progress in the spatiotemporal control of engineered bacteria via these methods and discusses the benefits and constraints of each approach.",

Despite their success in hematologic malignancies, these therapies encounter significant challenges in treating solid tumors, such as antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, limited cellular infiltration, off-target toxicity, and difficulties in manufacturing scalability. CAR-T cells have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in blood cancers but face obstacles in solid tumors, whereas CAR-NK cells offer reduced graft-versus-host disease but encounter similar barriers. TCR-T cells expand the range of treatable cancers by targeting intracellular antigens but require meticulous antigen selection to prevent off-target effects. Alternative therapies like TIL, NK, and CIK cells show promise but require further optimization to enhance persistence and overcome immunosuppressive barriers. Manufacturing complexity, high costs, and ensuring safety and efficacy remain critical challenges.

    "abstract": "Immunosenescence, the age-associated decline of the immune system, is pivotal in fostering drug resistance within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The accumulation of senescent immune cells and the release of pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors create a milieu that supports tumor survival and undermines therapeutic efficacy. Traditional cancer treatments often fail to address this underlying issue, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This article proposes an innovative strategy to overcome immunosenescence-induced drug resistance through the nanoparticle-mediated delivery of herbal-derived natural products (HDNPs), which possess senolytic and immunomodulatory properties capable of clearing senescent cells and rejuvenating immune function. Nanoparticle delivery systems enhance these compounds' stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery to the TME and senescent immune cells. By harnessing the synergistic effects of HDNPs and nanotechnology, this approach offers a novel and multifaceted solution to drug resistance in cancer therapy. It holds the potential to restore immune surveillance, reduce pro-survival signaling in cancer cells, and enhance the efficacy of conventional treatments. This paradigm shift emphasizes the importance of addressing immunosenescence as a therapeutic target and paves the way for more effective and personalized cancer interventions.",

    "abstract": "The estrogen-related receptor family genes (ERRs), including ESRRA, ESRRB, and ESRRG, have been implicated in a few tumors, exhibiting distinct roles through diverse mechanisms. The purpose of our research is to explore the commonalities and underlying mechanism of ERRs in malignancies from a pan-cancer perspective and to validate the role and mechanisms of ESRRG in gallbladder cancer (GBC). We leveraged public databases such as TCGA and GTEx to systematically investigate the potential functions of ERRs in malignancies. ESRRG expression was analyzed through immunohistochemical staining in gallbladder cancer and cholecystitis tissues. For functional validation, ESRRG was knocked down in GBC cell lines, followed by CCK-8, colony formation, scratch wound healing, Transwell migration, and invasion assays. Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence were performed to evaluate the relationship between ESRRG, PD-L1, and CD8 Compared to adjacent normal tissues, ESRRA is overexpressed in most tumors, ESRRB is generally underexpressed, and ESRRG exhibits significant expression alterations across various tumors. All three ERRs demonstrate significant prognostic value across different cancers. Notably, the strong associations of ERRs with key immunological features-stromal scores, immune cell infiltration, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB)-suggest their involvement in immune evasion and their potential utility in guiding immunotherapy strategies. All three ERRs display a positive correlation with advanced tumor stages in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL). Specifically, in CHOL, ESRRG expression is closely associated with lymphatic metastasis, poorer overall survival, reduced immune infiltration, elevated PD-L1 expression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and DNA damage response. In GBC tissues, we subsequently confirmed that ESRRG expression positively correlates with pathological staging and PD-L1 expression, while negatively correlating with prognosis and CD8 Our pan-cancer analysis reveals ERRs as critical regulators of tumor immunity and progression, with ESRRG emerging as a key oncogenic driver in GBC. The mechanistic link between ESRRG and PD-L1/EMT suggests its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. These findings underscore the need for tissue-specific targeting strategies for ERR family members in precision oncology.",

The molecular mechanism underlying cancer is among the key areas of research in the scientific community. Cancer, being a multifactorial disease, is controlled by many factors ranging from environmental to genetic to epigenetic factors. Epigenetic regulation holds a crucial role in tumorigenesis and its progression. Epigenetics refers to alterations in the genome that happen without any changes to the DNA sequence itself; they may be triggered by multiple factors ranging from environmental to dietary factors. It includes methylation of DNA and histone modifications. Histone modifications, including histone methylation, histone acetylation, and histone ubiquitination, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer. These epigenetic modifications via transcriptional regulation affect key cellular processes and are thus implicated in prostate cancer and other cancers. These epigenetic markers could be used as both diagnostic and prognostic markers and also could be used as novel therapeutic targets against prostate cancer and other malignancies.

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence and cellular reprogramming represent two fundamentally intertwined processes that profoundly influence aging and cancer. This paper explores how the permanent cell-cycle arrest of senescent cells and the identity-resetting capacity of reprogramming jointly shape biological outcomes in later life and tumor development. We synthesize recent findings to show that senescent cells, while halting the proliferation of damaged cells, can paradoxically promote tissue dysfunction and malignancy via their secretory phenotype. Conversely, induced reprogramming of somatic cells-exemplified by Yamanaka factors-resets cellular age and epigenetic marks, offering a potential to rejuvenate aged cells. Key findings highlight shared mechanisms (e.g., DNA damage responses and epigenetic remodeling) and bidirectional crosstalk between these processes: senescence signals can facilitate neighboring cell plasticity, whereas reprogramming attempts can trigger intrinsic senescence programs as a barrier. In aging tissues, transient (partial) reprogramming has been shown to erase senescence markers and restore cell function without inducing tumorigenesis, underlining a novel strategy to combat age-related degeneration. In cancer, we discuss how therapy-induced senescence of tumor cells may induce stem-cell-like traits in some cells and drive relapse, revealing a delicate balance between tumor suppression and tumor promotion. Understanding the interplay between senescence and reprogramming is crucial for developing innovative therapies. By targeting the senescence-reprogramming axis-for instance, via senolytic drugs, SASP inhibitors, or safe reprogramming techniques-there is significant therapeutic potential to ameliorate aging-related diseases and improve cancer treatment. Our findings underscore that carefully modulating cellular senescence and rejuvenation processes could pave the way for novel regenerative and anti-cancer strategies.",

In addition to summarizing the current state of our understanding, we offer insights into how m6A modifications modulate key oncogenic pathways, highlighting the implications of recent discoveries for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, we critically assess the limitations of previous studies and propose areas for future research, including the potential for targeting m6A as a novel approach in anti-metastatic therapies. Our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory landscape of m6A in metastasis, offering directions for continued exploration in this rapidly evolving field.",

    "title": "The novel combination of small-molecule inhibitors increases the survival and colony formation capacity of human induced pluripotent stem cells after single-cell dissociation.",
    "abstract": "ObjectivesHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold significant promise in regenerative medicine and drug discovery. However, single-cell dissociation, essential for genetic modification and clonal selection, often reduces hiPSC viability and colony formation. While various methods, including small molecules and feeder cells, have been developed to address this, their outcomes remain inconsistent. This study aims to develop more efficient methods to enhance hiPSC survival post-dissociation using a novel combination of well-characterized small-molecule inhibitors.MethodsHuman induced pluripotent stem cells were pretreated with Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Y27632), SMC4 (PD0325901\u2009+\u2009CHIR99021\u2009+\u2009thiazovivin\u2009+\u2009SB431542), or SiM5 (PD0325901\u2009+\u2009CHIR99021\u2009+\u2009Thiazovivin\u2009+\u2009SB431542\u2009+\u2009Pifithrin-\u03b1) for 1\u2005h before subjected to single-cell dissociation by accutase. The dissociated single hiPSCs were then cultured in NutriStem or StemFlex medium supplemented with Y27632, SMC4, or SiM5. Cell viability, pluripotency marker expression, colony formation capacity, and karyotype were then compared between various treatments. The effect of SiM5 treatment on hiPSCs survival and colony formation capacity was also tested under hypoxic conditions and after fluorescence-activated cell sorting.ResultsThe results show that SiM5 treatment significantly increases hiPSCs survival by approximately 2.5 and 25 times compared to those treated with SMC4 and Y27632, respectively. These results were consistently observed across different cell lines and culture media. Furthermore, SiM5 treatment also increased hiPSCs survival and proliferation after single-cell dissociation under hypoxic conditions. The withdrawal of SiM5 after treatment only temporarily hinders hiPSCs cell cycle progression, without impairing their subsequent expansion. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that SiM5 does not affect the pluripotency of hiPSCs following treatment. Additionally, it was found that SiM5 has no effect on the colony-forming ability or chromosomal stability of hiPSCs.ConclusionSiM5 treatment significantly improves hiPSCs survival and colony formation after single-cell dissociation across various conditions. This approach could enhance the efficiency of genetic manipulation and single-cell cloning, advancing hiPSCs applications in research and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) may show targetable vulnerabilities secondary to the characteristic loss of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Specifically, a synthetic lethal interaction was identified between E-cadherin loss and ROS1 inhibition. Several clinical trials are currently under way to assess the efficacy of ROS1 inhibitors in ILC; however, ROS1 expression has not been confirmed in ILC tumours and ROS1 has not been validated as a biomarker in the breast cancer setting. This study aimed to (i) examine ROS1 expression in a large cohort of breast cancer cases and (ii) investigate the biology and clinical significance of ROS1 positivity in breast cancer. ROS1 immunohistochemistry was performed on a large cohort of ILC (n\u2009=\u2009274) and invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST; n\u2009=\u2009431) cases with extensive clinicopathological data. The staining performance of four ROS1 antibody clones was compared. There was marked variation in ROS1 status according to antibody clone. D4D6 and SP384 were negative in almost all breast cancer cases, whereas EP282 and EPMGHR2 were positive in 37 and 47% of ILC cases, and 49 and 74% of NST cases, respectively. Only data from clones D4D6 and SP384 were highly concordant, while EP282 and EPMGHR2 were positive in distinct breast cancer subtypes. Assessment of ROS1 status in breast cancer appears to be highly antibody clone-dependent. ROS1 antibody clone selection will be an important consideration in the design of clinical trials investigating the clinical validity of ROS1 as a predictive biomarker in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and multiple myeloma (MM), yet no STAT3-selective drugs have been approved for clinical use. Newly synthesized compounds were screened by docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to measure the binding activity with STAT3. RNA-Seq, luciferase assays, western blot and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to detect the impact of RDp002 on STAT3 signalling. CCK-8, cell cycle, apoptosis assays and transwell were utilised to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of RDp002 in vitro. Xenograft models were used to assess the effectiveness of RDp002 in vivo. Various inhibitors were utilised to investigate how RDp002 causes tumour cell death. The human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG/K RDp002 exhibited had strong affinity for STAT3 and impaired the phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 and serine 727 residues. RDp002 suppressed the proliferation, survival, migration, growth and metastasis of TNBC and MM cells. RDp002 inhibited tumour cell viability primarily via lysosome-dependent cell death, which can be weakened by overexpression of STAT3. The toxicity of RDp002 in vivo was minimal based on results from hERG assays, blood biochemistry analysis and acute toxicity tests. RDp002 is a novel STAT3 inhibitor that exerts potent anti-tumour effects mainly by inducing lysosome-dependent cell death. RDp002 represents a promising therapeutic lead for TNBC and MM.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains difficult to treat due to its dense extracellular matrix (ECM), immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and deep-seated anatomy. To address these challenges, we developed IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO, an ultrasound (US)-responsive lipid nanosonosensitizer that synergizes sonodynamic therapy (SDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for orthotopic PC. IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO undergoes three key US-activated responses: (1) size reduction, (2) controlled release of irinotecan (IR) and nitric oxide (NO), and (3) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under low-dose US, IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO reduces in size (from ~120 nm to ~40 nm), enhancing tumor penetration, and releases NO to remodel the TME by normalizing vasculature and degrading ECM. This enhances nanosonosensitizers accumulation and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) infiltration. High-dose US irradiation triggers the generation of cytotoxic ROS, which, in combination with IR-mediated chemotherapy, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and enhances antitumor immunity. Additionally, combining IR&ZnPc@LNP-NO with PD-L1 antibody (\u03b1PD-L1) immunotherapy significantly prolongs survival in orthotopic PC models. The cascade strategy-size reduction, TME remodeling, and multimodal therapy-effectively overcomes stromal and immunosuppressive barriers, offering a robust platform for treating deep-seated PC.",

By directing Cas-mediated DNA cleavage to specific genomic targets and utilizing intrinsic DNA repair processes, this system can produce site-specific gene modifications.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) participate in early cellular defence mechanisms initiated in response to mitochondrial damage. They maintain mitochondrial quality control (MQC) by clearing damaged mitochondrial components, thereby ensuring the normal functioning of cellular processes. This process is crucial for cell survival and health, as mitochondria are the energy factories of cells, and their damage can cause cellular dysfunction and even death. Recent studies have shown that MDVs not only maintain mitochondrial health but also have a significant impact on tumour progression. MDVs selectively encapsulate and transport damaged mitochondrial proteins under oxidative stress and reduce the adverse effects of mitochondrial damage on cells, which may promote the survival and proliferation of tumour cells. Furthermore, it has been indicated that after cells experience mild stress, the number of MDVs significantly increases within 2-6\u00a0h, whereas mitophagy, a process of clearing damaged mitochondria, occurs 12-24\u00a0h later. This suggests that MDVs play a critical role in the early stress response of cells. Moreover, MDVs also have a significant role in intercellular communication, specifically in the tumour microenvironment. They can carry and transmit various bioactive molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which regulate tumour cell's growth, invasion, and metastasis. This intercellular communication may facilitate tumour spread and metastasis, making MDVs a potential therapeutic target. Advances in MDV research have identified novel biomarkers, clarified regulatory mechanisms, and provided evidence for clinical use. These breakthroughs pave the way for novel MDV-targeted therapies, offering improved treatment alternatives for cancer patients. Further research can identify MDVs' role in tumour development and elucidate future cancer treatment horizons.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy among women and is associated with high mortality and significant clinical challenges. Although conventional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have significantly improved patient survival, their efficacy remains limited by severe side effects and treatment resistance. In recent years, advances in immunotherapy have underscored the pivotal role of immune cells in treating BC. This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge on the roles of immune cells within the BC tumor microenvironment (TME), including their phenotypes, functions, and implications for immunotherapy. Following PRISMA guidelines, 71 studies published between 2010 and 2024 were analyzed. The results indicate that immune cell populations-such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)-are integral to tumor progression and therapeutic response. However, their functional heterogeneity and plasticity remain key obstacles to the development of effective and personalized immunotherapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms governing immune cell behavior within the BC TME and to advance precision immunotherapy. Such insights will lay the foundation for individualized treatment approaches, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life (QoL).",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome influences the host immune system, cancer development and progression, as well as the response to immunotherapy during cancer treatment. Here, we analyse the composition of the gut bacteriome in metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving Pembrolizumab immunotherapy within a prospective maintenance trial through opportunistic sampling during treatment. The gut microbiome profiles of NSCLC patients were obtained from stool samples collected during Pembrolizumab treatment and analysed with 16S rRNA metagenomics sequencing. Patient profiles were compared to a group of healthy individuals of matching ethnic group, age, sex, BMI and comorbidities. A significant decrease in the treated patients was observed in two prominent bacterial families of the phylum Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccocaceae, which comprised 31.6% and 21.8% of the bacteriome in the healthy group but only 10.9% and 14.2% in the treated patient group, respectively. Species within the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families are known to break down undigested carbohydrates generating short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as butyrate, acetate and propionate as their major fermentation end-products, which have been implicated in modifying host immune responses. In addition, a significant increase of the Bacteroidacaeae family (Bacteroidetes phylum) was observed from 10.7% in the healthy group to 23.3% in the treated patient group. Moreover, and in agreement with previous studies, a decrease in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the metastatic NSCLC Pembrolizumab-treated patients was observed.

    "title": "Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated proton therapy and proton arc therapy for pediatric ependymoma.",
    "abstract": "Proton Arc Therapy (PAT) is an emerging proton therapy treatment modality with the potential to reduce radiation exposure to healthy tissues compared to conventional Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) with fewer beams. This is an attractive option for treating pediatric patients, who are vulnerable to radiation-induced side effects. There is, however, a need to investigate the redistribution of dose to the target volume and organs at risk. In this study, we therefore explored the potential of PAT in proton therapy of pediatric ependymoma. Three-field IMPT and PAT treatment plans for 10 pediatric ependymoma patients were optimized using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The PAT plans consisted of 8 fields, spanning 170 degrees. Both modalities were robustly optimized with a \u00b1 2 mm isocenter shift and a \u00b1 3% range uncertainty. PAT showed improved CTV coverage compared to three-field IMPT, with a distinct increase in D98%. A clear dose reduction was found for the cochleae, with median values of 9.32 Gy(Relative Biological Effectiveness [RBE]) [0.76 - 30.40 Gy(RBE)] and 18.30 Gy(RBE) [1.24 - 29.75 Gy(RBE)] for PAT and IMPT, respectively, for the right cochlea. For the left cochlea, the respective doses were 12.34 Gy(RBE) [2.81 - 30.94 Gy(RBE)] and 18.49 Gy(RBE) [4.27 - 31.97 Gy(RBE)]. No significant difference for the brain integral dose was found between the two modalities. PAT can improve the dosimetric outcome of proton therapy in pediatric ependymoma patients. Organs at risk dose varied on a patient-to-patient basis; thus, individual treatment plan comparisons are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Factor H controls proximal complement activation, and its dysfunction leads to diseases that often manifest in the kidney. Structural and functional analyses have identified 4 distinct functional segments: an N-terminal regulatory unit, a cell binding unit, a segment with combined low-affinity C3b and heparin sites, and a C-terminal recognition or sensor unit with overlapping C3b/C3d and heparin sites. Three segments are linked to diseases. The regulatory segment is affected in C3 glomerulopathy and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. The second segment includes the Y402H polymorphism of age-related macular degeneration, is associated with different types of cancer, and is targeted by pathogens. The C-terminal sensor segment is involved in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, in FHR1:FHR3 deficient and autoantibody-positive hemolytic uremic syndrome form and is exploited by pathogens. Factor H function is modulated by Factor H like protein 1 and FHR1, 2 plasma proteins that share segments with Factor H. This interplay is critical for fine-tuning local complement. Understanding Factor H's physiological role, as well as the impact of its absence, mutations, or autoantibody targeting, provides insights into disease mechanisms and provides opportunities for therapeutic intervention by using full-length Factor H, its fragments, or complement-modulatory compounds.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cells are crucial for the anti-tumour immune response, and their exhaustion contributes to poor prognosis and limited immunotherapy efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we examined the immune microenvironment of CRC by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk sequencing data. T-cell subtypes in tumour tissues were analysed using CellMarker 2.0 and scType, and an intercellular communication network was constructed through CellChat. Our analysis revealed that exhausted CD8+ T cells exhibit strong interactions with epithelial cells, primarily via the MIF-(CD74\u2009+\u2009CXCR4), MIF-(CD74\u2009+\u2009CD44) and CD99-CD99 pathways. Based on CD8+ T-cell exhaustion markers, we developed a prognostic model using XGBoost, which demonstrated promising predictive capabilities for CRC prognosis and immunotherapy response. Functional assays showed that MIF knock-down significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and invasion. Our findings suggest that MIF and CD99 are key regulators of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in CRC. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying T-cell exhaustion in CRC and offers potential biomarkers for improving immunotherapy outcomes.",

    "title": "Melatonin enhances everolimus efficacy in breast cancer by suppressing mTOR pathway activation and promoting apoptosis and mitochondrial function.",
    "abstract": "Everolimus is used in the treatment of breast cancer by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly during anti-hormonal therapy. The efficacy of everolimus is limited due to a feedback loop that supresses mTOR while simultaneously enhancing Akt activation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) regulates mitochondrial activity, cell death, and autophagy due to its strong free radical scavenging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Melatonin, a naturally occurring oncostatic agent, slows tumor growth in a range of malignancies, including breast cancer. Due to its ability to protect healthy cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, along with its anti-cancer properties, melatonin has the potential to serve asan effective adjuvant in breast cancer therapy. It also inhibits the phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, two essential pathways implicated in breast cancer growth, which may aid in overcoming resistance to targeted treatments like everolimus. The combination effects of melatonin and everolimus on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer remains unexplored. This study examined the effectiveness of melatonin when combined with everolimus for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. To investigate the effects of melatonin and everolimus combination, we divided MCF-7 cells into four experimental groups: the control, Melatonin (3 mM), Everolimus (30 nM), and a combination of Melatonin and Everolimus (3 mM\u2009+\u200930 nM). Cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy activation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated using established techniques. Based on the cell viability test, the combination of 30 nM everolimus and 3 mM melatonin inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, which are downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, and reduced cell growth. In addition, co-administration of melatonin and everolimus increased apoptosis and led to Sub-G1 phase accumulation. LC3 protein expression and LC3 puncta analysis demonstrated autophagic activity. In terms of mitochondrial function, co-administration of melatonin with everolimus did not cause proton leakage or mitochondrial uncoupling, but did restore everolimus-induced respiratory inhibition. In conclusion, melatonin is thought to improve the effectiveness of everolimus by inhibiting mTOR downstream effectors, enhancing apoptosis, activating autophagy, improving mitochondrial respiration, and reducing MCF-7 growth.",

    "title": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPRK) revisited: evolving insights into structure, function, and pathology.",
    "abstract": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Kappa (PTPRK) is a membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the frequently deleted region of chromosome 6q, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Structurally, PTPRK comprises with an extracellular domain involved in cell-cell adhesion, a transmembrane region, and two intracellular catalytic domains responsible for its phosphatase activity. Notably, PTPRK undergoes proteolytic cleavage by Furin and ADAM10, resulting in the generation of an extracellular E-subunit and a P-subunit. Further processing by \u03b3-secretase releases the intracellular PIC, which plays a pivotal role in regulating \u03b2-catenin signaling within the nucleus. PTPRK is widely recognized for its tumor-suppressive properties across various cancers, including colorectal, lung, ovarian, and melanoma. Despite its function as a tumor suppressor, the expression and activity of PTPRK exhibit considerable variability across different cancer types and stages. It exerts its effects by dephosphorylating key signaling molecules such as EGFR, STAT3, CD133 and \u03b2-catenin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Beyond its role in cancer, PTPRK is also involved in immune regulation, particularly in the development of CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In the nervous system, PTPRK is linked to neurite outgrowth and synaptic transmission, with genetic polymorphisms in PTPRK associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Given its extensive involvement in cancer biology, immune regulation, and neurodevelopment, PTPRK presents a promising therapeutic target. Strategies aimed at restoring its activity or targeting PTPRK might offer new approaches for current cancer therapies and overcome drug resistance. In this review, we elucidate the structural characteristics and functional roles of PTPRK in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis. The variability of PTPRK suggests that the regulatory mechanisms governing its activity are intricate and worth further comprehensive investigation.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in treating advanced cervical cancer, emphasizing their potential as transformative therapeutic options in this complex clinical landscape. EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched for articles on the outcomes of ICIs in advanced cervical cancer patients. A pooled analysis was performed to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR: reported as an odds ratio (OR), progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR), overall survival (OS; HR), and safety outcomes risk ratio (RR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted to identify potential sources of bias and heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis included 5 studies involving 3,112 patients. Compared with standard therapies, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR; OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.27-2.23), prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; HR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.65-0.80), and extended overall survival (OS; HR\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.61-0.79). Subgroup analyses revealed potential predictors of treatment response. Moreover, ICIs exhibit a manageable safety profile, with adverse events consistent with known immune-related toxicities. This meta-analysis highlights the promising efficacy and favourable safety profile of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced cervical cancer. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, with ICIs emerging as a potential cornerstone therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate optimal patient selection, combination therapies, and long-term outcomes. This study provides valuable insights for clinicians and researchers, paving the way for personalized and effective treatment approaches for advanced cervical cancer.",

Patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200918 years with MIBC who had radical cystectomy from October 2012 to June 2018 were identified in the prospective COBLAnCE bladder cancer cohort. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. Patients were classified as MIBC-HR based on TNM staging. Disease-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 256 patients with MIBC-HR were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years and 204 patients were men (79.7%). 201 patients (78.5%) were current or former smokers. For staging, 226 patients were (y)pT3a or higher (88.3%) and 132 were N- (51.6%). Forty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.0%), and 69 received adjuvant chemotherapy (27.0%). Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy only, 59 received cisplatin-based therapy (86.8%). 182 patients (71.1%) constituted the ASO subgroup. 175 patients (68.3%) experienced an event up to the end of follow-up. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Median disease-free survival was 1.30 years [95%CI: 1.01-1.60] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 1.21 years [95%CI: 0.70-1.53] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. Median overall survival was 2.31 years [95%CI: 1.85-3.10] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 2.11 years [95%CI: 1.61-2.65] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. At 5 years, DFS was 27.4% [21.7;33.9%] in the MIBC-HR population and 23.7% [17.4;31.4] in the MIBC-HR-ASO population. OS at five years was 33.2% [27.1;40.0] for the MIBC-HR population and 29.6% [22.7;37.7] for the MIBC-HR-ASO population. Using real-world data, this study underscores the challenging prognosis of patients with MIBC-HR managed with RC, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy. New treatment protocols, such as the use of immunotherapies, may improve OS in this type of cancer, especially in the current therapeutic landscape where no highly effective treatment exists.",

In the present study, bioinformatics and cellular experiments were employed to investigate cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in glioma, with a specific focus on SLC31A1. The study findings indicated that many CRGs (SLC31A1, FDX1, DLST, LIPT1, LIPT2, DLD, NFE2L2, ATP7A, DLAT, GCSH, and ATP7B) were differentially expressed between glioma and non-tumor groups. These genes potentially influence glioma initiation and progression by modulating associated signaling pathways, including those involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, and the tumor microenvironment. Survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression model demonstrated that individuals classified as high-risk exhibited poorer prognosis, suggesting that CRGs possess prognostic capabilities. The assessment of tumor mutational burden indicated that CRGs could serve as biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma. Further functional analysis of SLC31A1 showed that its elevation was associated with increased glioma cell malignancy, promoting proliferation and migration. Additionally, treatment with the mitotic inhibitor MP-HJ-1b markedly suppressed SLC31A1 expression, consequently inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and migration. Extensive data analysis indicated that CRGs hold promise as both prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for glioma.",

Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a median OS of 34.75 months (95% CI\u2009=\u200920.23-49.27 months) for all CCA patients positive for KMT9\u03b1 in comparison to 54.21 months (95% CI\u2009=\u200941.78-66.63 months) for patients lacking KMT9\u03b1 overexpression (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Subtype analysis revealed strong differences in KMT9\u03b1 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified KMT9\u03b1 as an independent risk factor for shorter OS in CCA. This study demonstrates that a marked subset of CCA patients exhibit overexpression of KMT9\u03b1. These findings underscore the prognostic significance of KMT9\u03b1 and reinforce its potential as a therapeutic target, consistent with its role in other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a frequently studied catechin in green tea, has been shown to be involved in the antiproliferation and apoptosis of human Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. However, the pharmacological targets and mechanism by which EGCG can combat NPC patients remain to be studied in detail. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying EGCG's therapeutic effects on NPC, with an emphasis on developing a prognostic risk model and identifying potential therapeutic targets. A novel prognostic risk model was developed using univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression and multivariable Cox regression analyses, incorporating six genes to stratify patients into low- and highrisk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival in the high-risk group. The model's accuracy was further validated using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ESTIMATE analysis revealed significantly higher immune, stromal and overall ESTIMATE scores in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Immune profiling indicated significant differences in five immune cell subtypes (memory B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), gamma delta T cells, activated NK cells and activated dendritic cells) between the two risk groups. Additionally, the low-risk group showed greater sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemistry and molecular docking analyses identified CYCS and MYL12B as promising targets for EGCG treatment. This study utilised network pharmacology and bioinformatics to identify shared genes between EGCG and NPC, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which EGCG inhibits NPC and to develop a prognostic model for assessing patient outcomes. The findings provide potential insights for the development of anti-NPC therapies and their clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer therapies have transformed the landscape of cancer treatments but are often associated with off-target adverse drug reactions due to overlapping molecular pathways in healthy tissues, including those in the eye. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), expressed across various parts of the eye, can become unintended targets of FGFR inhibitors such as erdafitinib, infigratinib, and pemigatinib, leading to ocular adverse events (AEs) affecting the ocular surface and retina. AEs across clinical trials are graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which may not completely capture the ocular sequelae resulting from the use of emerging therapies. As CTCAE grading is mainly through the description of symptoms and their impact on visual acuity, it is imperative to use a tool that relies more on objective findings from ophthalmologic evaluations. The novel ocular adverse reaction severity grading scale developed by Amgen in collaboration with expert ophthalmologists, accounts for the anatomical regions impacted by ocular adverse reactions and anchors each severity grade to objective observable criteria from ophthalmologic evaluations. This grading scale is being used across the clinical development program for bemarituzumab to precisely characterize the ocular safety profile, enabling cross-specialty collaboration between oncologists and eye care providers to implement appropriate management strategies. This commentary article highlights the efforts led by Amgen in collaboration with regulatory, medical, and academic fields to develop tools that facilitate early recognition of adverse reactions and appropriate interventions for patient care.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes recent findings on the role of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their exosome-derived non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cancer cell resistance to therapeutics. M2 TAMs promote angiogenesis, suppress immune responses, and facilitate metastasis, thereby creating a tumor-supporting microenvironment. A range of antitumor drugs, including 5-FU, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, are mediated by M2 exosomes, each with distinct mechanisms of action. M2 exosomes transfer drug resistance capabilities via extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes containing miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. These exosome mediate the development of tumor drug resistance by regulating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin M2 exosomes can regulate cellular responses by delivering bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and ncRNA, which can also modulate cellular reactions to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting M2 TAMs and their exosome-mediated ncRNAs may offer new strategies to overcome drug resistance in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating robust prognostic models and personalized therapeutic strategies. This study integrated bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics to construct a prognostic model based on genes shared between ferroptosis and fatty acid metabolism (FAM). Using the TCGA-PRAD dataset, we identified 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the intersection of ferroptosis and FAM, of which 19 were significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS). A machine learning-based prognostic model, optimized using the Lasso\u2009+\u2009Random Survival Forest (RSF) algorithm, achieved a high C-index of 0.876 and demonstrated strong predictive accuracy (1-, 2-, and 3-year AUCs: 0.77, 0.75, and 0.78, respectively). The model, validated in the DFKZ cohort, stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting worse PFS and higher tumor mutation burden (TMB). Functional enrichment analysis revealed distinct pathway activities, with high-risk patients showing enrichment in immune-related and proliferative pathways, while low-risk patients were enriched in metabolic pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed heightened immune activity in high-risk patients, characterized by increased infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages, alongside elevated TIDE scores, suggesting immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. In contrast, low-risk patients exhibited higher infiltration of plasma cells and neutrophils and demonstrated better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq further elucidated the spatial distribution of model genes, highlighting the central role of macrophages in mediating risk stratification. Additionally, chemotherapy sensitivity analysis identified potential therapeutic agents, such as Erlotinib and Picolinic acid, for low-risk patients. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of CD38 in the PC-3 cell line led to elevated lipid peroxidation (C11-BODIPY) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting increased cell ferroptosis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for risk stratification and personalized treatment in PCa, bridging molecular mechanisms with clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have uncovered evidences for pro-tumorigenic activities attributed to IL-11, prompting a renewed focus on therapeutic strategies targeting IL-11 signaling for anti-tumor treatment. Here, we introduce 9MW3811, a monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize IL-11 effectively. By disrupting the IL-11/IL-11R\u03b1/gp130 complex, 9MW3811 inhibits JAK/STAT3 signaling, significantly reducing tumor growth in diverse mouse models. More importantly, 9MW3811 synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy, even in PD-1 non-responsive models like CT26. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that 9MW3811 remodels the tumor microenvironment by enhancing CD8+\u2009T cell infiltration and reversing T cell exhaustion via upregulated XCL1 and downregulated CCL7, boosting anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 9MW3811 counteracts PD-1-induced T cell exhaustion, with anti-PD-1 antibodies effectively mitigating PD-1 upregulation post-9MW3811 treatment. These compelling findings support ongoing clinical trials of 9MW3811, aiming to translate these preclinical insights into therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "During translation initiation, eIF1A binds the ribosome through its N- and C-terminal tails, but the functional importance of this temporal interaction in mammalian cells is lacking. Using a high-throughput drug screen targeting eIF1A-RPS10 interaction, we identified inhibitors (1Ais) for eIF1A, RPS10, or both. Applying 1Ais in biochemical assays along specific and global translation experiments, we confirmed known functions of eIF1A and uncovered new roles for both eIF1A and RPS10. Specifically, the eIF1A N-terminal tail (NTT) binding inhibitors revealed the requirement of eIF1A for translation re-initiation. Moreover, a cytosine at position +5 relative to the start codon AUG, located near eIF1A-NTT in the 48S structure, enhances sensitivity to 1Ais, suggesting that the initiating ribosome recognizes a broader AUG context than the conventional Kozak. Additionally, eIF1A-specific 1Ais predominately affect cancer-related pathways. In xenograft models of ovarian cancer, these 1Ais reduced tumor growth without apparent toxicity. Furthermore, inhibition of RPS10, but not eIF1A, modulates a context-dependent regulatory translation initiation at CUG codon of SARS-CoV-2 and impedes infection. Our study underscores 1Ais as effective means to study the role of eIF1A and RPS10 in translation and suggests their targeted inhibition as potential therapies for cancer and viral infections.",

Although these DNA repair-deficient tumors are eligible for effective targeted therapies, fully reliable diagnostic strategies based on functional assay have yet to be established, potentially limiting safe and proper application of the molecular targeted drugs. Here we show that transient transfection of artificial DNA substrates enables ultrarapid detection of HR and MMR. This finding led us to develop a diagnostic strategy that can determine the cellular HR/MMR status within one day without the need for control cells or tissues. Notably, the accuracy of this method allowed the discovery of a pathogenic RAD51D mutation, which was missed by existing companion diagnostic tests. Our methods, termed HR eye and MMR eye, are applicable to frozen tumor tissues and roughly predict the response to therapy. Overall, the findings presented here could pave the way for accurately assessing malignant tumors with functional defects in HR or MMR, a step forward in accelerating precision medicine.",

We analyze the association of FH alteration patterns with tumor heterogeneity and develop a CpG site-specific methylation signature for precise identification of FH-deficient RCC. Transcriptomic analysis unveils three distinctive molecular subtypes characterized by enrichment of immune/Angiogenic/Stromal (C1), WNT/Notch/MAPK (C2), and proliferation/stemness (C3) pathways, respectively. Tumors in C1 derive the most substantial survival benefit from a combination of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-angiogenic therapy. Tumors in C2 display moderate response to this therapeutic approach. In contrast, tumors in C3 exhibit an unfavorable response to anti-angiogenic monotherapy and its combination with ICB. These findings contribute to a profound understanding of the aggressive nature of FH-deficient RCC, offering insights into potential precision medicine approaches for disease management.",

Recruiting PLK1 to the central spindle during anaphase is necessary for its function in promoting cancer cell proliferation, which is achieved by binding to microtubule-associated protein regulating of cytokinesis (PRC1) located in the spindle. However, the role of PLK1/PRC1 signaling in chemotherapy resistance is unknown. In this study, we identified a small molecule B4 which inhibited PLK1/PRC1 signaling through disrupting the formation of PLK1/PRC1 protein complexes. In the presence of blocking PLK1/PRC1 signaling, enhanced sensitivity of drug-resistant tumors to traditional chemotherapy was found. Suppression of PLK1 activity by B4 inhibited disease progression in allograft models, and combination with cisplatin elicited dramatic regression of drug-resistant tumors. Our findings provide a promising strategy to target the PLK1 signaling cascade and demonstrate a potential modality to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have led to enduring responses in subsets of patients with cancer. However, these responses carry the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can diminish the overall benefit of ICI treatment. While associations between irAE development and overall survival have been increasingly documented, there is a need for further understanding of these connections in large prospective real-world cohorts. The Resistance Drivers for Immuno-Oncology Patients Interrogated by Harmonized Molecular Datasets (RADIOHEAD) study, a pan-tumor, prospective cohort of 1,070 individuals undergoing standard of care first-line ICI treatment, aims to identify factors driving irAEs and clinical response. Clinical data and longitudinal blood samples were collected prospectively at multiple time points from 49 community-based oncology clinics across the USA. Structured, harmonized clinical data underwent unbiased statistical analysis to uncover predictors of real-world overall survival (rwOS) and risk factors for irAEs. Across 1,070 participants' treatment courses, RADIOHEAD accumulated over 4,500 clinical data points. Patients experiencing any irAE (25.4%, n=272) exhibited significantly improved rwOS in the pan-tumor cohort (n=1,028, HR=0.41, 95% CI=(0.31, 0.55)). This association persisted when adjusting for age and metastatic disease in multivariate time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analysis, and was consistent across major tumor subtypes, including lung cancer and melanoma. Skin and endocrine irAEs of any grade were strongly associated with improved rwOS (Cox proportional hazard analysis, skin, p=2.03e-05; endocrine, p=0.0006). In this real-world cohort, the irAE rate appeared lower than those reported in clinical trials. Patients receiving corticosteroids prior to initiation of ICI treatment had significantly worse survival outcomes than non-users (HR 1.37, p=0.0054), with a stronger association with systemic steroid use (HR 1.75, p=0.0022). The risk of irAE was increased by exposure to combination immunotherapy relative to monotherapy (OR 4.17, p=2.8e-7), zoster vaccine (OR 2.4, p=5.2e-05), and decreased by prior chemotherapy (OR 1.69, p=0.0005). The RADIOHEAD cohort is a well-powered, real-world cohort that clearly demonstrates the association between irAE development with improved response and baseline steroid use with worse response to ICI treatment after adjustment for survival bias.",

    "title": "Long-term mortality outcomes among immunotherapy recipients treated with dupilumab for the management of cutaneous immune-related adverse events.",
    "abstract": "Dupilumab has been added to National Cancer Comprehensive Network guidelines as a therapeutic strategy for managing certain cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, little is known about the implications of dupilumab for cancer outcomes in this population. In this multi-institutional study, we evaluate the impact of dupilumab treatment on survival among ICB recipients. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of ICB recipients from the Mass General Brigham Healthcare System and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The dupilumab group was compared with two control groups who did not receive dupilumab: with and without cirAEs (control groups 1 and 2, respectively) that were 1:2 matched on sex, race, age at ICB initiation, Charlson Comorbidity Score, year of ICB initiation, and ICB type. Manual chart review was performed to obtain cirAE characteristics, systemic glucocorticoid use, dupilumab treatment, vital status, and last contact date. Time-varying multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to evaluate the impact of dupilumab on overall survival, adjusted for sex, race, age at ICB initiation, ICB type, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, cancer type, cancer stage at ICB initiation, and systemic glucocorticoid use. A total of 53 cirAE patients treated with dupilumab were compared with two control groups of 106 patients each. Most patients receiving dupilumab demonstrated either complete or partial resolution of their cirAE (88.7%). In multivariable modeling, the overall survival of the dupilumab group was not significantly different from control group 1 (HR=0.74, 95%\u2009CI: 0.35 to 1.60, p=0.5) or control group 2 (HR=0.70, 95%\u2009CI: 0.32 to 1.51, p=0.4). However, the use of systemic glucocorticoids within 2 years after ICB initiation was associated with poorer overall survival when comparing the dupilumab group to control group 1 (HR=2.03, 95%\u2009CI: 1.04 to 3.96, p=0.039) and control group 2 (HR=2.21, 95%\u2009CI: 1.25 to 3.91, p=0.006). This study suggests that dupilumab is an effective therapy for recalcitrant cirAEs and does not adversely impact mortality. Due to the observed detrimental effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, this study suggests the need to shift away from systemic glucocorticoid immunosuppression and toward targeted immune modulators for irAE management, though prospective randomized trials are necessary to investigate this.",

    "abstract": "ROS1 gene rearrangement is an important target for NSCLC treatment. There is not yet sufficient real-world data on ROS1 diagnostic methods, treatment selection, and clinical outcomes in the Chinese population. A single-center retrospective collection of patients with a diagnosis of ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC from July 2011 to November 2021 was performed to document the method of ROS1 testing, treatment options, efficacy, and resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in these patients. The method of ROS1 testing and initial treatment selection were significantly correlated with time. ROS1 testing shifted from FISH (67% pre-2019) to NGS (96.3% post-2019; p\u2009<\u20090.001). First-line ROS1-TKI use increased from 60.0% to 92.0% (p\u2009=\u20090.041). The vast majority of patients (90.0%) chose crizotinib as the initial ROS1 inhibitor, with objective response rates (for patients with target lesions) and median progression-free survival of 82.8% (95% CI: 68.1%-97.9%) and 18.7\u2009months (95% CI: 8.9-28.4\u2009months), respectively. CNS was the most common site of progression for crizotinib (60%, 13/26, including 11 intracranial progressions alone). Compared to patients who received a chemotherapy-based regimen (n\u2009=\u20098) as first-line therapy, patients who received ROS1-TKI (n\u2009=\u200932) as first-line therapy had significantly longer median PFS (18.3\u2009months vs. 3.7\u2009months, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For ROS1 inhibitor-resistant patients, 48.3% of patients underwent rebiopsy throughout the course of their disease, with G2032R being the most common secondary ROS1 mutation (7/8). With the innovation of diagnostic and therapeutic methods and the expansion of the scope of the health insurance coverage, more and more patients are benefiting from new technologies and targeted drugs. Although crizotinib has brought excellent therapeutic data for ROS1-positive patients, better brain protection strategies should be explored for ROS1-positive patients in the future. In addition, the low rate of rebiopsy in real-world ROS1-positive patients should also be emphasized in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer liver metastasis generally refers to the process where colorectal cancer cells enter the liver through the bloodstream and form new tumors within the liver. The roles of complexin 2 (CPLX2) and synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) in the recovery from colorectal cancer liver metastasis are not yet clear. Data sets GSE147602 and GSE144259 for colorectal cancer liver metastasis were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database generated from GPL21047 and GPL11154. Batch normalization, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screening, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, construction and analysis of the protein-protein interaction network, functional enrichment analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were conducted. Heatmaps of gene expression were plotted. Immune infiltration analysis and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis were performed. TargetScan was used to screen for miRNAs regulating central DEGs. Through experimental verification, a total of 1215 DEGs were identified. According to gene ontology analysis, they were mainly enriched in cell signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, signal transduction receptor binding, and cytokine binding. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis results showed that the target cells were mainly enriched in cholesterol metabolism olfactory transduction. In the enrichment projects of metascape, gene ontology enrichment items included regulation of circulation, muscle structure development, vascular process in the circulatory system, and extracellular matrix organization. The soft-thresholding power for weighted gene co-expression network analysis was set to 4. Four core genes were obtained by intersecting the central genes identified by 5 different algorithms, as shown in a Venn diagram. The heatmap of gene expression showed that the core genes (CPLX2, SNAP25, and Bassoon) were underexpressed in primary colorectal cancer and overexpressed in colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis showed that 3 genes (CPLX2, SNAP25, and Bassoon) were related to abdominal pain, jaundice, chemical and drug-induced liver injury, and necrosis. The related miRNAs for the CPLX2 gene were hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-613; for the SNAP25 gene were hsa-miR-181d-5p, hsa-miR-181b-5p, hsa-miR-181c-5p. The results confirmed that CPLX2 and SNAP25 positively regulated the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-AKT signaling pathway and promoted the progression of liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. CPLX2 and SNAP25 genes are overexpressed in colorectal cancer liver metastasis and may serve as important molecular targets.",

However, the mechanism of CR treating NSCLC remains unclear. In this study, a network pharmacology-based strategy is followed to address the issue. The targets related to CR or NSCLC were obtained from multiple online public databases. Compound-target network was constructed using Cytoscape. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed by STRING. Key transcription factors were explored in TRRUST. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were accomplished in Metascape. The druglikeness of compounds was tested in Molinspiration Cheminformatics Software. Autodock Vina was used for molecular docking. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed using Gromacs. There were 104 overlapped targets considered as key targets of CR treating NSCLC. The key components of CR, including reynosin, (4S,5S)-13-hydroxygermacrone 4,5-epoxide, and (E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hepten-3-one, were screened by topological parameters and bioactivity scores. Central clustered targets in PPI network (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], SRC, JAK2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 [MAPK3]) were identified as critical therapeutic targets of CR. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that therapeutic effect of CR on NSCLC involved various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, and pathways in cancer, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway were strongly related. Molecular docking and MD simulation suggested that key compounds in CR had high binding affinity to critical NSCLC targets, like EGFR, JAK2, SRC, and MAPK3, with stable complexes formed. This study revealed key components and mechanism of CR treating NSCLC based on a network pharmacology-driven strategy, providing a reference for in-depth study on treating NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "A combination of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) is correlated with the outcome of neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) for breast cancer. The purpose of this research sought to explore how IR affects breast cancer patients' reactions after NAT. We gathered 132 individuals with breast cancer who had surgery after NAT. Continuous values were analyzed using the Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test and independent samples t test; pathological complete response (PCR)-related independent influencing factors were investigated using the binary logistic regression model; and the predictive value of each index on the effectiveness of NAT was assessed using subject work characteristics (receiver operating characteristic) curves. Compared with the non-PCR group, the PCR group's IR levels were lower. Baseline IR levels and NAT effectiveness did not significantly correlate, according to multifactorial logistic analysis (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Nevertheless, there was a negative correlation (P\u2005<\u2005.05) between PCR and total cholesterol (TC)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and MetS-IR levels following NAT. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve prediction model, TC/HDL had a greater predictive value than MetS-IR. Dynamic IR indicators (\u0394TC/HDL and \u0394MetS-IR) demonstrate predictive value for NAT response in breast cancer, mechanistically linked to lipid metabolism reprogramming and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Future multicenter studies should validate optimal thresholds and investigate combined metabolic-immune targeted therapeutic strategies.",

Despite their remarkable efficacy, not all patients exhibit favorable responses to ICI therapy. Hence, more biomarkers for therapeutic prediction need to be discovered. In this study, we utilized public cohorts to investigate the predictive significance and immunological associations of apolipoprotein L6 (APOL6) in cancers. The expression of APOL6 was found to be enhanced in tumors of patients who exhibited strong immunotherapeutic responses across various types of cancer. Furthermore, APOL6 showed immune correlations in pan-cancer and was confirmed by the tissue microarray cohort and in vitro experiments. Overall, this study highlights that APOL6 serves as a beneficial biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. Additional research involving larger numbers of patients and the underlying mechanism is necessary to determine its effectiveness as a biomarker for predicting the benefits of ICIs.",

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase14 (MAPK14) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase10 (MAPK10) was found to be a common target for their treatment of AD. ARS and its derivatives may treat AD by modulating pathways such as Prolactin signaling, cancer pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and IL-17 signaling. ARS and its derivatives have the potential to treat AD. Artemisinin, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artemisinin and artemisinone could potentially treat AD by targeting MAPK14 and MAPK10.",

Herein, a rare case of de novo PEL with rapid progression harboring EZH2 and TP53 frameshift mutations was reported. A 57-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of pancytopenia and peripheral blasts (9%). He also had a 6-day history of hematemesis. The case was diagnosed as PEL. Bone marrow examination, immunophenotype, gene mutation analysis, and karyotyping confirmed the diagnosis of PEL. Early in his illness, the patient received acid suppression therapy, gastric protection, hemostatic treatment, and transfusions of red blood cell suspension and platelet concentrates at a local hospital. He was later transferred to our hospital, where the diagnosis of PEL was made, and induction chemotherapy was initiated. Following chemotherapy, the patient developed granulocytopenia, severe anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He required multiple transfusions of apheresis platelets and red blood cell suspensions for symptomatic relief. However, due to financial concerns, the patient discontinued treatment and passed away 20 days after starting therapy. Due to the unclear pathogenesis of PEL and the lack of targeted therapeutic drugs, the prognosis is inferior. Further research into the signaling pathways regulated by the identified mutations and their potential as therapeutic targets is essential to improve the prognosis of this aggressive form of leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) has become a serious global health concern due to its rising virulence and antibiotic resistance. As one of the leading members of ESKAPE pathogens, it plays a major role in a wide range of infections that cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The recent increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent (hvKP) strains due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, has greatly limited therapeutic options that highlights the need for novel approaches to combat the pathogen. This review outlines the virulence mechanisms, profiles of antibiotic resistance, and immune evasion strategies in K. pneumoniae. Also, it points out the role of capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and fimbriae in host colonization and immune evasion. Additionally, the review discusses the emerging therapeutic strategies of vaccine development, computational drug discovery, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The progress achieved in reverse vaccinology and structural biology enables the identification of new drug and vaccine targets, whereas AI and machine learning (ML) stand out as powerful candidates for high-throughput screening and drug design. However, challenges with antigenic variability, safety, and the need to collaborate globally still exist.

    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT)-mediated immunogenic cell death and immune checkpoint blockade offer new opportunities for tumor treatment. However, challenges including immunosuppression, hypoxic tumor microenvironments, and inadequate drug delivery hinder therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we developed a multifunctional biomimetic liposome microbubble named H-R@Lip@M, which is coated with melanoma cell membranes, contains perfluoropentane as its core, and is loaded with the sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether and the immune adjuvant resiquimod. The targeting properties of melanoma cell membranes enable effective accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) at tumor sites. Equipped with ultrasonic/photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these NPs allow precise control over the release of drugs and oxygen upon ultrasound stimulation. In vitro and in vivo results consistently showed that the NPs enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, halting primary tumor progression and preventing lung metastasis. Moreover, SDT increased reactive oxygen species levels within tumors, preferentially inducing apoptosis while maximizing immunogenic cell death. When combined with PD-L1 blockade, this synergy promotes dendritic cell maturation and alters various immune populations, boosting T-cell infiltration while enhancing M1 macrophage polarization and reducing regulatory T-cell presence. In summary, the proposed combination has the potential to synergistically enhance the efficacy of sono-immunotherapy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, providing valuable insights for addressing challenges associated with SDT-based cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-targeting drug delivery holds great promise for cancer treatment but faces significant challenges in penetrating solid tumors to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. By harnessing the natural tissue-penetration effect conferred by the CendR motif, we identified that the nucleolin (NCL)-targeted peptide F3 possesses tumor-penetrating capabilities. Co-administration of F3 with doxorubicin and the apoptosis-inducing protein TRAIL enhanced effective tumor penetration and improved antitumor activity. Taking advantage of TRAIL's natural self-trimerization, we developed a novel fusion protein, F3-TRAIL. This design enabled the trivalent assembly of F3 when fused with TRAIL, significantly enhancing its binding to NCL-positive tumor endothelial and parenchymal cells, resulting in deeper tumor penetration and superior antitumor effects compared to TRAIL alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that the multivalent F3-enhanced engagement with tumor cells potentiated TRAIL to trigger death receptor-dependent apoptosis signaling, even in TRAIL-resistant tumor cells. Building on this success, we constructed F3-HexaTR using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag superglue ligation system to generate a hexameric TRAIL, further amplifying cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy. Combined analysis of data from TCGA and GTEx revealed significantly elevated NCL expression across 18 solid tumor types, underscoring the clinical potential of F3-directed targeted therapy. These findings highlight that F3-mediated NCL targeting is an effective strategy to overcome tumor penetration barriers, particularly for protein drug delivery. This multivalent assembly approach represents an innovative avenue for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of various agents in the treatment of solid tumors.",

However, synthetic materials inevitably introduce incompatibilities. This has led to focusing on biomimetic drug delivery systems (DDS) based on biologically derived cell membranes. This \"top-down\" approach to nanomedicine preparation is simple and effective, as the inherited cell membranes and cell surface substances can mimic nature when delivering drugs back into the body, interacting similarly to the source cells at the biological interface. The concept of biologically derived TCM and biomimetic membranes aligns well with nature, the human body, and medicine, thereby enhancing the in vivo compatibility of TCM. This review focused on the recent progress using biomimetic membranes for TCM in cancer therapy, emphasizing the effective integration of biomimetic nanomedicine and TCM in applications such as cancer diagnosis, imaging, precision treatment, and immunotherapy. The review also provided potential suggestions on the challenges and prospects in this field.",

    "abstract": "Proton beam therapy using pencil beam scanning is an advanced radiotherapy technique that utilises proton beams to precisely target tumours. It is known for its enhanced ability in sparing healthy tissue and potentially reducing toxicity. Clinical experience with pencil beam scanning in the treatment of mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and outcomes of a prospectively observed cohort. A total of 162 patients were irradiated between May 2013 and December 2020, with a median age of 32\u202fyears (range: 18.4-79.2) and followed up until April 2024. The median applied dose was 30 GyE (range: 20-40). Deep inspiration breath hold was used in 146 patients to enhance targeting precision. The disease-free survival, overall survival and local control rates were 95.1\u202f%, 98.8\u202f% and 98.8\u202f%, respectively. The median follow-up was 59.1\u202fmonths (range: 4-120.1). The most common acute toxicities observed were oesophageal and skin toxicity. Grade 1 oesophageal mucositis occurred in 76 patients (47\u202f%), grade 2 in 16 patients (10\u202f%). Dermatitis of grade 1 and 2 was observed in 65 (40\u202f%) and 4 (3\u202f%) patients respectively. Grade 1 pulmonary toxicity presented in 8 patients (4.9\u202f%), and grade 2 in one patient (0.6\u202f%). The most predominant late toxicity was grade 2 hypothyroidism in 37 patients (23\u202f%). Three patients (1.8\u202f%) underwent coronary interventions during follow-up, and one patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma 3\u202fmonths post-RT. No unexpected acute or late toxicities were observed. Proton beam therapy using pencil beam scanning is a safe and effective technique in terms of toxicity and local control, even when irradiating mediastinal targets.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous and complex cancer influenced by both the tumor microenvironment and multi-level regulation of the nervous system. Increasing evidence highlights critical roles of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in modulating HCC progression. Psychological stress and emotional disturbances, representing CNS dysregulation, directly accelerate tumor growth, metastasis, and impair anti-tumor immunity in HCC. PNS involvement, particularly autonomic innervation, extensively reshapes the hepatic tumor microenvironment; specifically, sympathetic activation promotes immune suppression, tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stemness via \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) stabilization, whereas parasympathetic signals generally exert anti-inflammatory and tumor-suppressive effects mediated by acetylcholine. Neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine precisely regulate critical pathways such as AKT/mTOR, ERK, and NF-\u03baB, thereby driving malignant cell behaviors, immune evasion, and chemoresistance. Neuro-targeted pharmacological interventions (e.g., SSRIs, \u03b2-blockers, dopamine antagonists) and behavioral therapies have shown efficacy in preclinical studies, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Additionally, neural-associated biomarkers like NEDD9, CNTN1, and nerve growth factor (NGF) exhibit prognostic significance, supporting their future clinical application. By systematically integrating neuroscience with oncology, this review identifies innovative neural-based therapeutic strategies, highlights key mechanistic insights, and outlines promising directions for future research and personalized clinical management of HCC.",

Neoadjuvant therapy, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and NAC combined with immunotherapy, can improve the resection and long-term survival rates. However, not all patients respond well to neoadjuvant therapy. It has been confirmed that immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, can affect the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy. This paper summarizes current preclinical and clinical evidence to more fully describe the effects of neoadjuvant therapy on the immune microenvironment of GC, to provide the impetus to identify biomarkers to predict the potency of neoadjuvant therapy, and to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance, which should promote the development of individualized and accurate treatments for GC patients.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage-based drugs are widely used in cancer therapy, yet resistance remains a significant challenge. In this study, we uncovered a non-DNA repair mechanism contributing to resistance in cancer cells. We found that in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, CIP2A degradation via ubiquitination enhanced PP2A phosphatase activity, leading to the dephosphorylation of ATR at Ser428 in the cytoplasm. This dephosphorylation promoted the formation of the prolyl cis-isomeric form of ATR at its Ser428-Pro429 motif, a mitochondria-targeted antiapoptotic protein (mtATR). Surprisingly, the resistant PDAC cells paradoxically accumulated both mtATR and proapoptotic tBid at mitochondria, forming the mtATR-tBid complex. This complex silenced tBid, inducing apoptotic dormancy. Antagonizing mtATR, either through the PP2A inhibitor LB-100 or a cytoplasmic ATR-specific antibody, reactivated the pre-accumulated mitochondrial tBid and induced apoptosis in resistant PDAC cells. In an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, LB-100 alone significantly suppressed resistant tumor growth by disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of resistance to DNA damage-based cancer drugs and introduce a new action mechanism of LB-100, which works through mtATR-tBid complex-mediated apoptotic dormancy triggered by CIP2A degradation-mediated PP2A activation. Disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex may represent a promising strategy to restore or sensitize resistant cancer cells to apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "The MYC family of transcription factors-comprising c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC-plays a pivotal role in oncogenesis, driving cancer progression and resistance to therapy. While MYC proteins have long been considered challenging drug targets due to their intricate structures, recent advances have led to the development of promising inhibitors. This review explores the role of MYC overexpression in promoting radiotherapy resistance in aggressive neuroendocrine malignancies through multiple mechanisms, including increased tumor cell invasion, enhanced DNA damage repair and oxidative stress management, pro-survival autophagy, survival of circulating tumor cells, angiogenesis, awakening from dormancy, and modulation of chronic inflammation and host immunity. Paradoxically, MYC overexpression can also enhance radiosensitivity in certain cancer cells by driving pro-apoptotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage that overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of direct MYC inhibitors, detailing their current stage of preclinical and clinical development as novel anti-cancer therapeutics. This review highlights MYC's role in cancer metastasis and radiotherapy resistance while examining the potential of MYC inhibitors as radiosensitizers in adult and pediatric neuroendocrine malignancies, including small cell lung cancer, large cell neuroendocrine lung cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, central nervous system embryonal tumors, and medulloblastoma.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we explore key innovations in photoactivated therapeutic programming of carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), focusing on their diverse nanostructural configurations and their exceptional photothermal, photochemical, and photoacoustic properties. These attributes position CBNs as remarkable phototherapeutic agents, capable of addressing critical challenges in targeted cancer therapy through their precision, multifunctionality, and adaptability to specific therapeutic modalities. We will explore their diverse derivatives, and the role of chemical augmentation and site-specific surface functionalisation, which are pivotal in optimising the targeting and efficacy of phototherapeutic interventions. The biological and physical relevance of this ever-growing library of nanomaterials in targeted phototherapy will be thoroughly explored. Dynamic photo-triggering of the underlying molecular mechanisms of action e.g., energy conversion modalities lie at the heart of these therapeutic innovations. We will further discuss the tunability and programming of these carriers and structure-function alterations at specific therapeutic wavelengths. The application space of phototherapies is thoroughly mapped exploring the three primary approaches of photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and photochemical internalisation as well as emerging techniques and promising multimodal approaches that combine two or more of these processes. The specificity of the target tissue site and the approach under study forms another critical focus area of this review, with an emphasis on three types of cancer-breast cancer, lung cancer, and gliomas-that have demonstrated some of the most promising outcomes from photomedicine. We also provide a perspective on in vitro and in vivo validation and preclinical testing of CBNs for phototherapeutic applications. Finally, we reflect on the potential of CBNs to revolutionise targeted cancer therapy through data-driven materials design and integration with computational tools for biophysical performance optimisation. The exciting integration of machine learning into nanoparticle research and phototherapy has potential to fundamentally transform the landscape of nanomedicine. These techniques ranging from supervised learning algorithms such as random forests and support vector machines to more advanced neural networks and deep learning, can enable unprecedented precision in predicting, optimising, and tailoring the properties of nanoparticles for targeted applications. The transformative impact of photoactivated CBNs in advancing cancer treatment, paves the way for their clinical application and widespread adoption in personalised photomedicine. We conclude with a section on the current challenges facing the reproducibility, manufacturing throughput, and biocompatibility of these nanostructured materials including their long-term effects in trials and degradation profiles in biological systems as evaluated in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Electroporation (EP) is a technique that temporarily increases cell membrane permeability through high-voltage electrical pulses, facilitating the internalization of hydrophilic drugs. When used in clinics, reversible EP offers significant advantages in drug delivery with minimal systemic toxicity, making it a promising approach in cancer therapy (Electrochemotherapy). However, is still challenging to increase therapeutic efficacy, such as increasing the amount of drug internalized by cells after EP. To address these limitations, integrating nanocarriers-particularly liposomes-into EP-based drug delivery strategies has shown great promise. Due to their structural similarity to cell membranes, liposomes can undergo electroporation without causing irreversible cell damage, enabling localized and controlled drug release at targeted sites. This study preliminary evaluates the effectiveness of positively charged gentamicin sulfate loaded liposomes (GS-Lipo) in enhancing gentamicin sulfate uptake through electroporation. The focus is on liposome behavior under EP, drug release, and cellular internalization. The results reveal a strong interplay between liposomes and EP. While EP minimally affects liposome size (sizes lower than 250\u202fnm before and after EP) and PDI, it significantly enhances intracellular uptake and drug release by creating transient pores in liposomal bilayer, facilitating gentamicin diffusion. In vitro uptake studies performed with fluorescent liposomes and GS-Lipo, confirmed superior performance when combined treatment (EP\u202f+\u202fGS-Lipo) is used. By optimizing electroporation parameters (160\u202fV, 200\u202fV, and 250\u202fV), this study succeeds in maximizing intracellular drug concentration, with the long-term goal of improving therapeutic outcomes, particularly in cancer treatment.",

In this study, 143 colorectal cancer tissue samples were collected for analyzing the correlation between LACTB level and clinical information. Another 24 recent cases and adjacent tissues underwent qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect LACTB expression. The differentiation and proliferation of CRC cells were evaluated by AKP levels, E-cadherin expression, cell viability, colony formation, EdU assay, and cell cycle. Subcutaneous models explored LACTB's pro-differentiation effects. The glandular-like structures of tumor were observed by HE staining, immunofluorescence detection of microvilli proteins, and transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that LACTB expression in colorectal cancer tissues was lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. Higher LACTB expression was correlated with slower tumor progression, better prognosis and higher differentiation degree. Overexpressing LACTB in CRC cells enhanced differentiation markers level (AKP and E-cadherin), while inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest. Conversely, LACTB knockdown had an opposite effect. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor model suggested that LACTB overexpression inhibited tumor growth, induced tissue differentiation and glandular-like structures formation. Collectively, our results show that LACTB overexpression promotes cell differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in CRC cells, which may serve as a therapy target for CRC.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a life-threatening disease characterised by progressive loss of motor neurons with few therapeutic options. The MIROCALS study tested the hypothesis that low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2 In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, male and female riluzole-naive participants, with either a possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite ALS diagnosis (revised El Escorial criteria), aged 18-76 years, with symptom duration of 24 months or fewer, and slow vital capacity of 70% or more, underwent a riluzole-only 12-18 week run-in period before randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 million international units (MIU) IL-2 From June 19, 2017, to Oct 16, 2019, 304 participants were screened, of whom 220 (72%) met all criteria for random allocation after the 12-to-18-week run-in period on riluzole. 136 (62%) of participants were male and 84 participants (38%) were female. 25 (11%) of the 220 randomly allocated participants were defined as having possible ALS under El Escorial criteria. At the cutoff date there was no loss to follow-up, and all 220 patients who were randomly allocated were documented as either deceased (90 [41%]) or alive (130 [59%]), so all participants were included in the ITT and safety populations. The primary endpoint unadjusted analysis showed a non-significant 19% decrease in risk of death with IL-2 With this treatment schedule, IL-2 European Commission H2020 Programme; French Health Ministry PHRC2014; and Motor Neurone Disease Association.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030, with its mortality continuing to rise, unlike other common cancers such as breast or colorectal. Late-stage diagnosis, often accompanied by metastatic dissemination, drastically impairs patient survival and underscores the urgent need for improved biomarkers to guide therapeutic strategies. While molecular signatures have been proposed to stratify pancreatic cancer patients, their ability to predict outcomes remains limited. In this study, we applied established molecular signatures to our in-house transcriptomic data from a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. We took advantage of published datasets to construct comprehensive atlases of cells present in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers. The atlas of metastasis samples, representative of routinely harvested patient biopsies, revealed that monocyte/macrophage signatures provided superior discriminatory power compared to existing molecular classifications. Notably, the abundance of TREM2-expressing macrophages emerged as a significant parameter for stratifying patients. Our findings position TREM2",

    "title": "Nanotechnology-Enhanced siRNA Delivery: Revolutionizing Cancer Therapy.",
    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a transformative approach for cancer therapy, enabling precise gene silencing through small interfering RNA (siRNA). However, the clinical application of siRNA-based treatments faces challenges such as rapid degradation, inefficient cellular uptake, and immune system clearance. Nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery has revolutionized cancer therapy by addressing these limitations, improving siRNA stability, tumor-specific targeting, and therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements in nanocarrier engineering have introduced innovative strategies to enhance the safety and precision of siRNA-based therapies, offering new opportunities for personalized medicine. This review highlights three key innovations in nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery: artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nanocarrier design, multifunctional nanoparticles for combined therapeutic strategies, and biomimetic nanocarriers for enhanced biocompatibility. AI-driven nanocarriers utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize nanoparticle properties, improving drug release profiles and minimizing off-target effects. Multifunctional nanoparticles integrate siRNA with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photothermal therapy, enabling synergistic treatment approaches that enhance therapeutic outcomes and reduce drug resistance. Biomimetic nanocarriers, including exosome-mimicking systems and cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles, improve circulation time, immune evasion, and targeted tumor delivery. These innovations collectively enhance the precision, efficiency, and safety of siRNA-based cancer therapies. The scope and novelty of these advancements lie in their ability to overcome the primary barriers of siRNA delivery while paving the way for clinically viable solutions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest developments in nanocarrier fabrication, preclinical and clinical studies, and safety assessments. By integrating AI-driven design, multifunctionality, and biomimicry, nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery holds immense potential for the future of precision cancer therapy.",

    "title": "A Machine Learning-Based Strategy Predicts Selective and Synergistic Drug Combinations for Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.",
    "abstract": "Combination therapies are one potential approach to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory or relapsed disease. However, comprehensive testing in scarce primary patient material is hampered by the many drug combination possibilities. Furthermore, inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity necessitates personalized treatment optimization approaches that effectively exploit patient-specific vulnerabilities to selectively target both the disease- and resistance-driving cell populations. Here, we developed a systematic combinatorial design strategy that uses machine learning to prioritize the most promising drug combinations for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The predictive approach leveraged single-cell transcriptomics and single-agent response profiles measured in primary patient samples to identify targeted combinations that co-inhibit treatment resistant cancer cells individually in each AML patient sample. Cell type compositions evolved dynamically between the diagnostic and R/R stages uniquely in each patient, hence requiring personalized drug combination strategies to target therapy-resistant cancer cells. Cell population-specific drug combination assays demonstrated how patient-specific and disease stage-tailored combination predictions led to treatments with synergy and strong potency in R/R AML cells, while the same combinations elicited non-synergistic effects in the diagnostic stage and minimal co-inhibitory effects on normal cells. In preliminary experiments on clinical trial samples, the approach predicted clinical outcomes to venetoclax-azacitidine combination therapy in patients with AML. Overall, the computational-experimental approach provides a rational means to identify personalized combinatorial regimens for individual AML patients with R/R disease that target treatment-resistant leukemic cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical translation.",
