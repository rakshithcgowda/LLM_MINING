    "title": "Melatonin enhances everolimus efficacy in breast cancer by suppressing mTOR pathway activation and promoting apoptosis and mitochondrial function.",
    "abstract": "Everolimus is used in the treatment of breast cancer by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly during anti-hormonal therapy. The efficacy of everolimus is limited due to a feedback loop that supresses mTOR while simultaneously enhancing Akt activation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) regulates mitochondrial activity, cell death, and autophagy due to its strong free radical scavenging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Melatonin, a naturally occurring oncostatic agent, slows tumor growth in a range of malignancies, including breast cancer. Due to its ability to protect healthy cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, along with its anti-cancer properties, melatonin has the potential to serve asan effective adjuvant in breast cancer therapy. It also inhibits the phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, two essential pathways implicated in breast cancer growth, which may aid in overcoming resistance to targeted treatments like everolimus. The combination effects of melatonin and everolimus on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer remains unexplored. This study examined the effectiveness of melatonin when combined with everolimus for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. To investigate the effects of melatonin and everolimus combination, we divided MCF-7 cells into four experimental groups: the control, Melatonin (3 mM), Everolimus (30 nM), and a combination of Melatonin and Everolimus (3 mM\u2009+\u200930 nM). Cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy activation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated using established techniques. Based on the cell viability test, the combination of 30 nM everolimus and 3 mM melatonin inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, which are downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, and reduced cell growth. In addition, co-administration of melatonin and everolimus increased apoptosis and led to Sub-G1 phase accumulation. LC3 protein expression and LC3 puncta analysis demonstrated autophagic activity. In terms of mitochondrial function, co-administration of melatonin with everolimus did not cause proton leakage or mitochondrial uncoupling, but did restore everolimus-induced respiratory inhibition. In conclusion, melatonin is thought to improve the effectiveness of everolimus by inhibiting mTOR downstream effectors, enhancing apoptosis, activating autophagy, improving mitochondrial respiration, and reducing MCF-7 growth.",

    "title": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPRK) revisited: evolving insights into structure, function, and pathology.",
    "abstract": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type Kappa (PTPRK) is a membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the frequently deleted region of chromosome 6q, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Structurally, PTPRK comprises with an extracellular domain involved in cell-cell adhesion, a transmembrane region, and two intracellular catalytic domains responsible for its phosphatase activity. Notably, PTPRK undergoes proteolytic cleavage by Furin and ADAM10, resulting in the generation of an extracellular E-subunit and a P-subunit. Further processing by \u03b3-secretase releases the intracellular PIC, which plays a pivotal role in regulating \u03b2-catenin signaling within the nucleus. PTPRK is widely recognized for its tumor-suppressive properties across various cancers, including colorectal, lung, ovarian, and melanoma. Despite its function as a tumor suppressor, the expression and activity of PTPRK exhibit considerable variability across different cancer types and stages. It exerts its effects by dephosphorylating key signaling molecules such as EGFR, STAT3, CD133 and \u03b2-catenin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Beyond its role in cancer, PTPRK is also involved in immune regulation, particularly in the development of CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, and has been implicated in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In the nervous system, PTPRK is linked to neurite outgrowth and synaptic transmission, with genetic polymorphisms in PTPRK associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Given its extensive involvement in cancer biology, immune regulation, and neurodevelopment, PTPRK presents a promising therapeutic target. Strategies aimed at restoring its activity or targeting PTPRK might offer new approaches for current cancer therapies and overcome drug resistance. In this review, we elucidate the structural characteristics and functional roles of PTPRK in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis. The variability of PTPRK suggests that the regulatory mechanisms governing its activity are intricate and worth further comprehensive investigation.",

    "title": "Unlocking the potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced cervical cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in treating advanced cervical cancer, emphasizing their potential as transformative therapeutic options in this complex clinical landscape. EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched for articles on the outcomes of ICIs in advanced cervical cancer patients. A pooled analysis was performed to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR: reported as an odds ratio (OR), progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR), overall survival (OS; HR), and safety outcomes risk ratio (RR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted to identify potential sources of bias and heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis included 5 studies involving 3,112 patients. Compared with standard therapies, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR; OR\u2009=\u20091.68, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.27-2.23), prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; HR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.65-0.80), and extended overall survival (OS; HR\u2009=\u20090.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.61-0.79). Subgroup analyses revealed potential predictors of treatment response. Moreover, ICIs exhibit a manageable safety profile, with adverse events consistent with known immune-related toxicities. This meta-analysis highlights the promising efficacy and favourable safety profile of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced cervical cancer. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, with ICIs emerging as a potential cornerstone therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate optimal patient selection, combination therapies, and long-term outcomes. This study provides valuable insights for clinicians and researchers, paving the way for personalized and effective treatment approaches for advanced cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "To describe characteristics, management, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at high risk of recurrence (MIBC-HR) undergoing radical cystectomy in France and a subgroup of these patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after RC and were managed with active surveillance only (MIBC-HR-ASO). Patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200918 years with MIBC who had radical cystectomy from October 2012 to June 2018 were identified in the prospective COBLAnCE bladder cancer cohort. Patients with metastatic disease were excluded. Patients were classified as MIBC-HR based on TNM staging. Disease-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 256 patients with MIBC-HR were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 68.5 years and 204 patients were men (79.7%). 201 patients (78.5%) were current or former smokers. For staging, 226 patients were (y)pT3a or higher (88.3%) and 132 were N- (51.6%). Forty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (18.0%), and 69 received adjuvant chemotherapy (27.0%). Of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy only, 59 received cisplatin-based therapy (86.8%). 182 patients (71.1%) constituted the ASO subgroup. 175 patients (68.3%) experienced an event up to the end of follow-up. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Median disease-free survival was 1.30 years [95%CI: 1.01-1.60] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 1.21 years [95%CI: 0.70-1.53] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. Median overall survival was 2.31 years [95%CI: 1.85-3.10] in the MIBC-HR cohort and 2.11 years [95%CI: 1.61-2.65] in the MIBC-HR-ASO subgroup. At 5 years, DFS was 27.4% [21.7;33.9%] in the MIBC-HR population and 23.7% [17.4;31.4] in the MIBC-HR-ASO population. OS at five years was 33.2% [27.1;40.0] for the MIBC-HR population and 29.6% [22.7;37.7] for the MIBC-HR-ASO population. Using real-world data, this study underscores the challenging prognosis of patients with MIBC-HR managed with RC, regardless of whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy. New treatment protocols, such as the use of immunotherapies, may improve OS in this type of cancer, especially in the current therapeutic landscape where no highly effective treatment exists.",

    "abstract": "Cuproptosis, a novel form of regulatory cell death, was investigated in this study for its effects on cuproptosis-associated proteins during gliomas development, offering novel insights into the mechanism of copper ion-based antitumor drugs. In the present study, bioinformatics and cellular experiments were employed to investigate cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in glioma, with a specific focus on SLC31A1. The study findings indicated that many CRGs (SLC31A1, FDX1, DLST, LIPT1, LIPT2, DLD, NFE2L2, ATP7A, DLAT, GCSH, and ATP7B) were differentially expressed between glioma and non-tumor groups. These genes potentially influence glioma initiation and progression by modulating associated signaling pathways, including those involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammatory responses, and the tumor microenvironment. Survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression model demonstrated that individuals classified as high-risk exhibited poorer prognosis, suggesting that CRGs possess prognostic capabilities. The assessment of tumor mutational burden indicated that CRGs could serve as biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma. Further functional analysis of SLC31A1 showed that its elevation was associated with increased glioma cell malignancy, promoting proliferation and migration. Additionally, treatment with the mitotic inhibitor MP-HJ-1b markedly suppressed SLC31A1 expression, consequently inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and migration. Extensive data analysis indicated that CRGs hold promise as both prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for glioma.",

However, the pharmacological targets and mechanism by which EGCG can combat NPC patients remain to be studied in detail. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying EGCG's therapeutic effects on NPC, with an emphasis on developing a prognostic risk model and identifying potential therapeutic targets. A novel prognostic risk model was developed using univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression and multivariable Cox regression analyses, incorporating six genes to stratify patients into low- and highrisk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival in the high-risk group. The model's accuracy was further validated using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ESTIMATE analysis revealed significantly higher immune, stromal and overall ESTIMATE scores in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Immune profiling indicated significant differences in five immune cell subtypes (memory B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), gamma delta T cells, activated NK cells and activated dendritic cells) between the two risk groups. Additionally, the low-risk group showed greater sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemistry and molecular docking analyses identified CYCS and MYL12B as promising targets for EGCG treatment. This study utilised network pharmacology and bioinformatics to identify shared genes between EGCG and NPC, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which EGCG inhibits NPC and to develop a prognostic model for assessing patient outcomes. The findings provide potential insights for the development of anti-NPC therapies and their clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Targeted cancer therapies have transformed the landscape of cancer treatments but are often associated with off-target adverse drug reactions due to overlapping molecular pathways in healthy tissues, including those in the eye. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), expressed across various parts of the eye, can become unintended targets of FGFR inhibitors such as erdafitinib, infigratinib, and pemigatinib, leading to ocular adverse events (AEs) affecting the ocular surface and retina. AEs across clinical trials are graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which may not completely capture the ocular sequelae resulting from the use of emerging therapies. As CTCAE grading is mainly through the description of symptoms and their impact on visual acuity, it is imperative to use a tool that relies more on objective findings from ophthalmologic evaluations. The novel ocular adverse reaction severity grading scale developed by Amgen in collaboration with expert ophthalmologists, accounts for the anatomical regions impacted by ocular adverse reactions and anchors each severity grade to objective observable criteria from ophthalmologic evaluations. This grading scale is being used across the clinical development program for bemarituzumab to precisely characterize the ocular safety profile, enabling cross-specialty collaboration between oncologists and eye care providers to implement appropriate management strategies. This commentary article highlights the efforts led by Amgen in collaboration with regulatory, medical, and academic fields to develop tools that facilitate early recognition of adverse reactions and appropriate interventions for patient care.",

M2 TAMs promote angiogenesis, suppress immune responses, and facilitate metastasis, thereby creating a tumor-supporting microenvironment. A range of antitumor drugs, including 5-FU, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, are mediated by M2 exosomes, each with distinct mechanisms of action. M2 exosomes transfer drug resistance capabilities via extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes containing miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. These exosome mediate the development of tumor drug resistance by regulating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin M2 exosomes can regulate cellular responses by delivering bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and ncRNA, which can also modulate cellular reactions to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, and chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting M2 TAMs and their exosome-mediated ncRNAs may offer new strategies to overcome drug resistance in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating robust prognostic models and personalized therapeutic strategies. This study integrated bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics to construct a prognostic model based on genes shared between ferroptosis and fatty acid metabolism (FAM). Using the TCGA-PRAD dataset, we identified 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the intersection of ferroptosis and FAM, of which 19 were significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS). A machine learning-based prognostic model, optimized using the Lasso\u2009+\u2009Random Survival Forest (RSF) algorithm, achieved a high C-index of 0.876 and demonstrated strong predictive accuracy (1-, 2-, and 3-year AUCs: 0.77, 0.75, and 0.78, respectively). The model, validated in the DFKZ cohort, stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group exhibiting worse PFS and higher tumor mutation burden (TMB). Functional enrichment analysis revealed distinct pathway activities, with high-risk patients showing enrichment in immune-related and proliferative pathways, while low-risk patients were enriched in metabolic pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed heightened immune activity in high-risk patients, characterized by increased infiltration of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages, alongside elevated TIDE scores, suggesting immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. In contrast, low-risk patients exhibited higher infiltration of plasma cells and neutrophils and demonstrated better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq further elucidated the spatial distribution of model genes, highlighting the central role of macrophages in mediating risk stratification. Additionally, chemotherapy sensitivity analysis identified potential therapeutic agents, such as Erlotinib and Picolinic acid, for low-risk patients. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of CD38 in the PC-3 cell line led to elevated lipid peroxidation (C11-BODIPY) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting increased cell ferroptosis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for risk stratification and personalized treatment in PCa, bridging molecular mechanisms with clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have uncovered evidences for pro-tumorigenic activities attributed to IL-11, prompting a renewed focus on therapeutic strategies targeting IL-11 signaling for anti-tumor treatment. Here, we introduce 9MW3811, a monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize IL-11 effectively. By disrupting the IL-11/IL-11R\u03b1/gp130 complex, 9MW3811 inhibits JAK/STAT3 signaling, significantly reducing tumor growth in diverse mouse models. More importantly, 9MW3811 synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy, even in PD-1 non-responsive models like CT26. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that 9MW3811 remodels the tumor microenvironment by enhancing CD8+\u2009T cell infiltration and reversing T cell exhaustion via upregulated XCL1 and downregulated CCL7, boosting anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Furthermore, 9MW3811 counteracts PD-1-induced T cell exhaustion, with anti-PD-1 antibodies effectively mitigating PD-1 upregulation post-9MW3811 treatment. These compelling findings support ongoing clinical trials of 9MW3811, aiming to translate these preclinical insights into therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "During translation initiation, eIF1A binds the ribosome through its N- and C-terminal tails, but the functional importance of this temporal interaction in mammalian cells is lacking. Using a high-throughput drug screen targeting eIF1A-RPS10 interaction, we identified inhibitors (1Ais) for eIF1A, RPS10, or both. Applying 1Ais in biochemical assays along specific and global translation experiments, we confirmed known functions of eIF1A and uncovered new roles for both eIF1A and RPS10. Specifically, the eIF1A N-terminal tail (NTT) binding inhibitors revealed the requirement of eIF1A for translation re-initiation. Moreover, a cytosine at position +5 relative to the start codon AUG, located near eIF1A-NTT in the 48S structure, enhances sensitivity to 1Ais, suggesting that the initiating ribosome recognizes a broader AUG context than the conventional Kozak. Additionally, eIF1A-specific 1Ais predominately affect cancer-related pathways. In xenograft models of ovarian cancer, these 1Ais reduced tumor growth without apparent toxicity. Furthermore, inhibition of RPS10, but not eIF1A, modulates a context-dependent regulatory translation initiation at CUG codon of SARS-CoV-2 and impedes infection. Our study underscores 1Ais as effective means to study the role of eIF1A and RPS10 in translation and suggests their targeted inhibition as potential therapies for cancer and viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) act as guardians of the human genome, and defects in HR or MMR are causative in at least a quarter of all malignant tumors. Although these DNA repair-deficient tumors are eligible for effective targeted therapies, fully reliable diagnostic strategies based on functional assay have yet to be established, potentially limiting safe and proper application of the molecular targeted drugs. Here we show that transient transfection of artificial DNA substrates enables ultrarapid detection of HR and MMR. This finding led us to develop a diagnostic strategy that can determine the cellular HR/MMR status within one day without the need for control cells or tissues. Notably, the accuracy of this method allowed the discovery of a pathogenic RAD51D mutation, which was missed by existing companion diagnostic tests. Our methods, termed HR eye and MMR eye, are applicable to frozen tumor tissues and roughly predict the response to therapy. Overall, the findings presented here could pave the way for accurately assessing malignant tumors with functional defects in HR or MMR, a step forward in accelerating precision medicine.",

To deepen our understanding of FH-deficient RCC, we conduct a comprehensive integrated genomic study. We analyze the association of FH alteration patterns with tumor heterogeneity and develop a CpG site-specific methylation signature for precise identification of FH-deficient RCC. Transcriptomic analysis unveils three distinctive molecular subtypes characterized by enrichment of immune/Angiogenic/Stromal (C1), WNT/Notch/MAPK (C2), and proliferation/stemness (C3) pathways, respectively. Tumors in C1 derive the most substantial survival benefit from a combination of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and anti-angiogenic therapy. Tumors in C2 display moderate response to this therapeutic approach. In contrast, tumors in C3 exhibit an unfavorable response to anti-angiogenic monotherapy and its combination with ICB. These findings contribute to a profound understanding of the aggressive nature of FH-deficient RCC, offering insights into potential precision medicine approaches for disease management.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have led to enduring responses in subsets of patients with cancer. However, these responses carry the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can diminish the overall benefit of ICI treatment. While associations between irAE development and overall survival have been increasingly documented, there is a need for further understanding of these connections in large prospective real-world cohorts. The Resistance Drivers for Immuno-Oncology Patients Interrogated by Harmonized Molecular Datasets (RADIOHEAD) study, a pan-tumor, prospective cohort of 1,070 individuals undergoing standard of care first-line ICI treatment, aims to identify factors driving irAEs and clinical response. Clinical data and longitudinal blood samples were collected prospectively at multiple time points from 49 community-based oncology clinics across the USA. Structured, harmonized clinical data underwent unbiased statistical analysis to uncover predictors of real-world overall survival (rwOS) and risk factors for irAEs. Across 1,070 participants' treatment courses, RADIOHEAD accumulated over 4,500 clinical data points. Patients experiencing any irAE (25.4%, n=272) exhibited significantly improved rwOS in the pan-tumor cohort (n=1,028, HR=0.41, 95% CI=(0.31, 0.55)). This association persisted when adjusting for age and metastatic disease in multivariate time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analysis, and was consistent across major tumor subtypes, including lung cancer and melanoma. Skin and endocrine irAEs of any grade were strongly associated with improved rwOS (Cox proportional hazard analysis, skin, p=2.03e-05; endocrine, p=0.0006). In this real-world cohort, the irAE rate appeared lower than those reported in clinical trials. Patients receiving corticosteroids prior to initiation of ICI treatment had significantly worse survival outcomes than non-users (HR 1.37, p=0.0054), with a stronger association with systemic steroid use (HR 1.75, p=0.0022). The risk of irAE was increased by exposure to combination immunotherapy relative to monotherapy (OR 4.17, p=2.8e-7), zoster vaccine (OR 2.4, p=5.2e-05), and decreased by prior chemotherapy (OR 1.69, p=0.0005). The RADIOHEAD cohort is a well-powered, real-world cohort that clearly demonstrates the association between irAE development with improved response and baseline steroid use with worse response to ICI treatment after adjustment for survival bias.",

    "abstract": "Dupilumab has been added to National Cancer Comprehensive Network guidelines as a therapeutic strategy for managing certain cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, little is known about the implications of dupilumab for cancer outcomes in this population. In this multi-institutional study, we evaluate the impact of dupilumab treatment on survival among ICB recipients. We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of ICB recipients from the Mass General Brigham Healthcare System and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The dupilumab group was compared with two control groups who did not receive dupilumab: with and without cirAEs (control groups 1 and 2, respectively) that were 1:2 matched on sex, race, age at ICB initiation, Charlson Comorbidity Score, year of ICB initiation, and ICB type. Manual chart review was performed to obtain cirAE characteristics, systemic glucocorticoid use, dupilumab treatment, vital status, and last contact date. Time-varying multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to evaluate the impact of dupilumab on overall survival, adjusted for sex, race, age at ICB initiation, ICB type, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, cancer type, cancer stage at ICB initiation, and systemic glucocorticoid use. A total of 53 cirAE patients treated with dupilumab were compared with two control groups of 106 patients each. Most patients receiving dupilumab demonstrated either complete or partial resolution of their cirAE (88.7%). In multivariable modeling, the overall survival of the dupilumab group was not significantly different from control group 1 (HR=0.74, 95%\u2009CI: 0.35 to 1.60, p=0.5) or control group 2 (HR=0.70, 95%\u2009CI: 0.32 to 1.51, p=0.4). However, the use of systemic glucocorticoids within 2 years after ICB initiation was associated with poorer overall survival when comparing the dupilumab group to control group 1 (HR=2.03, 95%\u2009CI: 1.04 to 3.96, p=0.039) and control group 2 (HR=2.21, 95%\u2009CI: 1.25 to 3.91, p=0.006). This study suggests that dupilumab is an effective therapy for recalcitrant cirAEs and does not adversely impact mortality. Due to the observed detrimental effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, this study suggests the need to shift away from systemic glucocorticoid immunosuppression and toward targeted immune modulators for irAE management, though prospective randomized trials are necessary to investigate this.",

There is not yet sufficient real-world data on ROS1 diagnostic methods, treatment selection, and clinical outcomes in the Chinese population. A single-center retrospective collection of patients with a diagnosis of ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC from July 2011 to November 2021 was performed to document the method of ROS1 testing, treatment options, efficacy, and resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in these patients. The method of ROS1 testing and initial treatment selection were significantly correlated with time. ROS1 testing shifted from FISH (67% pre-2019) to NGS (96.3% post-2019; p\u2009<\u20090.001). First-line ROS1-TKI use increased from 60.0% to 92.0% (p\u2009=\u20090.041). The vast majority of patients (90.0%) chose crizotinib as the initial ROS1 inhibitor, with objective response rates (for patients with target lesions) and median progression-free survival of 82.8% (95% CI: 68.1%-97.9%) and 18.7\u2009months (95% CI: 8.9-28.4\u2009months), respectively. CNS was the most common site of progression for crizotinib (60%, 13/26, including 11 intracranial progressions alone). Compared to patients who received a chemotherapy-based regimen (n\u2009=\u20098) as first-line therapy, patients who received ROS1-TKI (n\u2009=\u200932) as first-line therapy had significantly longer median PFS (18.3\u2009months vs. 3.7\u2009months, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For ROS1 inhibitor-resistant patients, 48.3% of patients underwent rebiopsy throughout the course of their disease, with G2032R being the most common secondary ROS1 mutation (7/8). With the innovation of diagnostic and therapeutic methods and the expansion of the scope of the health insurance coverage, more and more patients are benefiting from new technologies and targeted drugs. Although crizotinib has brought excellent therapeutic data for ROS1-positive patients, better brain protection strategies should be explored for ROS1-positive patients in the future. In addition, the low rate of rebiopsy in real-world ROS1-positive patients should also be emphasized in clinical practice.",

However, the mechanism of CR treating NSCLC remains unclear. In this study, a network pharmacology-based strategy is followed to address the issue. The targets related to CR or NSCLC were obtained from multiple online public databases. Compound-target network was constructed using Cytoscape. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed by STRING. Key transcription factors were explored in TRRUST. Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were accomplished in Metascape. The druglikeness of compounds was tested in Molinspiration Cheminformatics Software. Autodock Vina was used for molecular docking. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed using Gromacs. There were 104 overlapped targets considered as key targets of CR treating NSCLC. The key components of CR, including reynosin, (4S,5S)-13-hydroxygermacrone 4,5-epoxide, and (E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hepten-3-one, were screened by topological parameters and bioactivity scores. Central clustered targets in PPI network (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], SRC, JAK2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 [MAPK3]) were identified as critical therapeutic targets of CR. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that therapeutic effect of CR on NSCLC involved various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, and pathways in cancer, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway were strongly related. Molecular docking and MD simulation suggested that key compounds in CR had high binding affinity to critical NSCLC targets, like EGFR, JAK2, SRC, and MAPK3, with stable complexes formed. This study revealed key components and mechanism of CR treating NSCLC based on a network pharmacology-driven strategy, providing a reference for in-depth study on treating NSCLC.",

The purpose of this research sought to explore how IR affects breast cancer patients' reactions after NAT. We gathered 132 individuals with breast cancer who had surgery after NAT. Continuous values were analyzed using the Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test and independent samples t test; pathological complete response (PCR)-related independent influencing factors were investigated using the binary logistic regression model; and the predictive value of each index on the effectiveness of NAT was assessed using subject work characteristics (receiver operating characteristic) curves. Compared with the non-PCR group, the PCR group's IR levels were lower. Baseline IR levels and NAT effectiveness did not significantly correlate, according to multifactorial logistic analysis (P\u2005>\u2005.05). Nevertheless, there was a negative correlation (P\u2005<\u2005.05) between PCR and total cholesterol (TC)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and MetS-IR levels following NAT. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve prediction model, TC/HDL had a greater predictive value than MetS-IR. Dynamic IR indicators (\u0394TC/HDL and \u0394MetS-IR) demonstrate predictive value for NAT response in breast cancer, mechanistically linked to lipid metabolism reprogramming and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

    "abstract": "The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly revolutionized the approach to treating advanced cancers. Despite their remarkable efficacy, not all patients exhibit favorable responses to ICI therapy. Hence, more biomarkers for therapeutic prediction need to be discovered. In this study, we utilized public cohorts to investigate the predictive significance and immunological associations of apolipoprotein L6 (APOL6) in cancers. The expression of APOL6 was found to be enhanced in tumors of patients who exhibited strong immunotherapeutic responses across various types of cancer. Furthermore, APOL6 showed immune correlations in pan-cancer and was confirmed by the tissue microarray cohort and in vitro experiments. Overall, this study highlights that APOL6 serves as a beneficial biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. Additional research involving larger numbers of patients and the underlying mechanism is necessary to determine its effectiveness as a biomarker for predicting the benefits of ICIs.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic mechanisms of artemisinin (ARS) and its derivatives in atopic dermatitis (AD) using network pharmacology and molecular docking. Molecules and disease targets were screened using public databases, including SwissTargetPrediction, PharmMapper, and Genecards. Core targets were identified, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape for topological analysis. Relevant data were obtained from the DAVID database for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Molecular docking of ARS and its derivatives with target genes was performed using AutoDock, with results visualized in Pymol. A functional PPI network was established, and molecular docking demonstrated strong binding activity between ARS derivatives and target protein. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase14 (MAPK14) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase10 (MAPK10) was found to be a common target for their treatment of AD. ARS and its derivatives may treat AD by modulating pathways such as Prolactin signaling, cancer pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and IL-17 signaling. ARS and its derivatives have the potential to treat AD. Artemisinin, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artemisinin and artemisinone could potentially treat AD by targeting MAPK14 and MAPK10.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) has become a serious global health concern due to its rising virulence and antibiotic resistance. As one of the leading members of ESKAPE pathogens, it plays a major role in a wide range of infections that cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. The recent increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent (hvKP) strains due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, has greatly limited therapeutic options that highlights the need for novel approaches to combat the pathogen. This review outlines the virulence mechanisms, profiles of antibiotic resistance, and immune evasion strategies in K. pneumoniae. Also, it points out the role of capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and fimbriae in host colonization and immune evasion. Additionally, the review discusses the emerging therapeutic strategies of vaccine development, computational drug discovery, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The progress achieved in reverse vaccinology and structural biology enables the identification of new drug and vaccine targets, whereas AI and machine learning (ML) stand out as powerful candidates for high-throughput screening and drug design. However, challenges with antigenic variability, safety, and the need to collaborate globally still exist. This review focuses on the need for interdisciplinary approaches involving molecular biology and immunology with computational sciences to address K. pneumoniae infections and provide appropriate therapies in the era of antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Sonodynamic therapy (SDT)-mediated immunogenic cell death and immune checkpoint blockade offer new opportunities for tumor treatment. However, challenges including immunosuppression, hypoxic tumor microenvironments, and inadequate drug delivery hinder therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, we developed a multifunctional biomimetic liposome microbubble named H-R@Lip@M, which is coated with melanoma cell membranes, contains perfluoropentane as its core, and is loaded with the sonosensitizer hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether and the immune adjuvant resiquimod. The targeting properties of melanoma cell membranes enable effective accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) at tumor sites. Equipped with ultrasonic/photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these NPs allow precise control over the release of drugs and oxygen upon ultrasound stimulation. In vitro and in vivo results consistently showed that the NPs enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, halting primary tumor progression and preventing lung metastasis. Moreover, SDT increased reactive oxygen species levels within tumors, preferentially inducing apoptosis while maximizing immunogenic cell death. When combined with PD-L1 blockade, this synergy promotes dendritic cell maturation and alters various immune populations, boosting T-cell infiltration while enhancing M1 macrophage polarization and reducing regulatory T-cell presence. In summary, the proposed combination has the potential to synergistically enhance the efficacy of sono-immunotherapy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, providing valuable insights for addressing challenges associated with SDT-based cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-targeting drug delivery holds great promise for cancer treatment but faces significant challenges in penetrating solid tumors to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. By harnessing the natural tissue-penetration effect conferred by the CendR motif, we identified that the nucleolin (NCL)-targeted peptide F3 possesses tumor-penetrating capabilities. Co-administration of F3 with doxorubicin and the apoptosis-inducing protein TRAIL enhanced effective tumor penetration and improved antitumor activity. Taking advantage of TRAIL's natural self-trimerization, we developed a novel fusion protein, F3-TRAIL. This design enabled the trivalent assembly of F3 when fused with TRAIL, significantly enhancing its binding to NCL-positive tumor endothelial and parenchymal cells, resulting in deeper tumor penetration and superior antitumor effects compared to TRAIL alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that the multivalent F3-enhanced engagement with tumor cells potentiated TRAIL to trigger death receptor-dependent apoptosis signaling, even in TRAIL-resistant tumor cells. Building on this success, we constructed F3-HexaTR using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag superglue ligation system to generate a hexameric TRAIL, further amplifying cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy. Combined analysis of data from TCGA and GTEx revealed significantly elevated NCL expression across 18 solid tumor types, underscoring the clinical potential of F3-directed targeted therapy. These findings highlight that F3-mediated NCL targeting is an effective strategy to overcome tumor penetration barriers, particularly for protein drug delivery. This multivalent assembly approach represents an innovative avenue for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of various agents in the treatment of solid tumors.",

However, synthetic materials inevitably introduce incompatibilities. This has led to focusing on biomimetic drug delivery systems (DDS) based on biologically derived cell membranes. This \"top-down\" approach to nanomedicine preparation is simple and effective, as the inherited cell membranes and cell surface substances can mimic nature when delivering drugs back into the body, interacting similarly to the source cells at the biological interface. The concept of biologically derived TCM and biomimetic membranes aligns well with nature, the human body, and medicine, thereby enhancing the in vivo compatibility of TCM. This review focused on the recent progress using biomimetic membranes for TCM in cancer therapy, emphasizing the effective integration of biomimetic nanomedicine and TCM in applications such as cancer diagnosis, imaging, precision treatment, and immunotherapy. The review also provided potential suggestions on the challenges and prospects in this field.",

It is known for its enhanced ability in sparing healthy tissue and potentially reducing toxicity. Clinical experience with pencil beam scanning in the treatment of mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity and outcomes of a prospectively observed cohort. A total of 162 patients were irradiated between May 2013 and December 2020, with a median age of 32\u202fyears (range: 18.4-79.2) and followed up until April 2024. The median applied dose was 30 GyE (range: 20-40). Deep inspiration breath hold was used in 146 patients to enhance targeting precision. The disease-free survival, overall survival and local control rates were 95.1\u202f%, 98.8\u202f% and 98.8\u202f%, respectively. The median follow-up was 59.1\u202fmonths (range: 4-120.1). The most common acute toxicities observed were oesophageal and skin toxicity. Grade 1 oesophageal mucositis occurred in 76 patients (47\u202f%), grade 2 in 16 patients (10\u202f%). Dermatitis of grade 1 and 2 was observed in 65 (40\u202f%) and 4 (3\u202f%) patients respectively. Grade 1 pulmonary toxicity presented in 8 patients (4.9\u202f%), and grade 2 in one patient (0.6\u202f%). The most predominant late toxicity was grade 2 hypothyroidism in 37 patients (23\u202f%). Three patients (1.8\u202f%) underwent coronary interventions during follow-up, and one patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma 3\u202fmonths post-RT. No unexpected acute or late toxicities were observed. Proton beam therapy using pencil beam scanning is a safe and effective technique in terms of toxicity and local control, even when irradiating mediastinal targets.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous and complex cancer influenced by both the tumor microenvironment and multi-level regulation of the nervous system. Increasing evidence highlights critical roles of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in modulating HCC progression. Psychological stress and emotional disturbances, representing CNS dysregulation, directly accelerate tumor growth, metastasis, and impair anti-tumor immunity in HCC. PNS involvement, particularly autonomic innervation, extensively reshapes the hepatic tumor microenvironment; specifically, sympathetic activation promotes immune suppression, tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stemness via \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) stabilization, whereas parasympathetic signals generally exert anti-inflammatory and tumor-suppressive effects mediated by acetylcholine. Neurotransmitters including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine precisely regulate critical pathways such as AKT/mTOR, ERK, and NF-\u03baB, thereby driving malignant cell behaviors, immune evasion, and chemoresistance. Neuro-targeted pharmacological interventions (e.g., SSRIs, \u03b2-blockers, dopamine antagonists) and behavioral therapies have shown efficacy in preclinical studies, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Additionally, neural-associated biomarkers like NEDD9, CNTN1, and nerve growth factor (NGF) exhibit prognostic significance, supporting their future clinical application. By systematically integrating neuroscience with oncology, this review identifies innovative neural-based therapeutic strategies, highlights key mechanistic insights, and outlines promising directions for future research and personalized clinical management of HCC.",

Neoadjuvant therapy, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and NAC combined with immunotherapy, can improve the resection and long-term survival rates.

It has been confirmed that immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment, including T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, can affect the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy. This paper summarizes current preclinical and clinical evidence to more fully describe the effects of neoadjuvant therapy on the immune microenvironment of GC, to provide the impetus to identify biomarkers to predict the potency of neoadjuvant therapy, and to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance, which should promote the development of individualized and accurate treatments for GC patients.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage-based drugs are widely used in cancer therapy, yet resistance remains a significant challenge. In this study, we uncovered a non-DNA repair mechanism contributing to resistance in cancer cells. We found that in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, CIP2A degradation via ubiquitination enhanced PP2A phosphatase activity, leading to the dephosphorylation of ATR at Ser428 in the cytoplasm. This dephosphorylation promoted the formation of the prolyl cis-isomeric form of ATR at its Ser428-Pro429 motif, a mitochondria-targeted antiapoptotic protein (mtATR). Surprisingly, the resistant PDAC cells paradoxically accumulated both mtATR and proapoptotic tBid at mitochondria, forming the mtATR-tBid complex. This complex silenced tBid, inducing apoptotic dormancy. Antagonizing mtATR, either through the PP2A inhibitor LB-100 or a cytoplasmic ATR-specific antibody, reactivated the pre-accumulated mitochondrial tBid and induced apoptosis in resistant PDAC cells. In an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, LB-100 alone significantly suppressed resistant tumor growth by disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of resistance to DNA damage-based cancer drugs and introduce a new action mechanism of LB-100, which works through mtATR-tBid complex-mediated apoptotic dormancy triggered by CIP2A degradation-mediated PP2A activation. Disrupting the mtATR-tBid complex may represent a promising strategy to restore or sensitize resistant cancer cells to apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "The MYC family of transcription factors-comprising c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC-plays a pivotal role in oncogenesis, driving cancer progression and resistance to therapy. While MYC proteins have long been considered challenging drug targets due to their intricate structures, recent advances have led to the development of promising inhibitors. This review explores the role of MYC overexpression in promoting radiotherapy resistance in aggressive neuroendocrine malignancies through multiple mechanisms, including increased tumor cell invasion, enhanced DNA damage repair and oxidative stress management, pro-survival autophagy, survival of circulating tumor cells, angiogenesis, awakening from dormancy, and modulation of chronic inflammation and host immunity. Paradoxically, MYC overexpression can also enhance radiosensitivity in certain cancer cells by driving pro-apoptotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage that overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of direct MYC inhibitors, detailing their current stage of preclinical and clinical development as novel anti-cancer therapeutics. This review highlights MYC's role in cancer metastasis and radiotherapy resistance while examining the potential of MYC inhibitors as radiosensitizers in adult and pediatric neuroendocrine malignancies, including small cell lung cancer, large cell neuroendocrine lung cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, central nervous system embryonal tumors, and medulloblastoma.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we explore key innovations in photoactivated therapeutic programming of carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), focusing on their diverse nanostructural configurations and their exceptional photothermal, photochemical, and photoacoustic properties. These attributes position CBNs as remarkable phototherapeutic agents, capable of addressing critical challenges in targeted cancer therapy through their precision, multifunctionality, and adaptability to specific therapeutic modalities. We will explore their diverse derivatives, and the role of chemical augmentation and site-specific surface functionalisation, which are pivotal in optimising the targeting and efficacy of phototherapeutic interventions. The biological and physical relevance of this ever-growing library of nanomaterials in targeted phototherapy will be thoroughly explored. Dynamic photo-triggering of the underlying molecular mechanisms of action e.g., energy conversion modalities lie at the heart of these therapeutic innovations. We will further discuss the tunability and programming of these carriers and structure-function alterations at specific therapeutic wavelengths. The application space of phototherapies is thoroughly mapped exploring the three primary approaches of photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and photochemical internalisation as well as emerging techniques and promising multimodal approaches that combine two or more of these processes. The specificity of the target tissue site and the approach under study forms another critical focus area of this review, with an emphasis on three types of cancer-breast cancer, lung cancer, and gliomas-that have demonstrated some of the most promising outcomes from photomedicine. We also provide a perspective on in vitro and in vivo validation and preclinical testing of CBNs for phototherapeutic applications. Finally, we reflect on the potential of CBNs to revolutionise targeted cancer therapy through data-driven materials design and integration with computational tools for biophysical performance optimisation. The exciting integration of machine learning into nanoparticle research and phototherapy has potential to fundamentally transform the landscape of nanomedicine. These techniques ranging from supervised learning algorithms such as random forests and support vector machines to more advanced neural networks and deep learning, can enable unprecedented precision in predicting, optimising, and tailoring the properties of nanoparticles for targeted applications. The transformative impact of photoactivated CBNs in advancing cancer treatment, paves the way for their clinical application and widespread adoption in personalised photomedicine. We conclude with a section on the current challenges facing the reproducibility, manufacturing throughput, and biocompatibility of these nanostructured materials including their long-term effects in trials and degradation profiles in biological systems as evaluated in vitro and in vivo.",

    "title": "Assessing liposomal nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery through electroporation.",
    "abstract": "Electroporation (EP) is a technique that temporarily increases cell membrane permeability through high-voltage electrical pulses, facilitating the internalization of hydrophilic drugs. When used in clinics, reversible EP offers significant advantages in drug delivery with minimal systemic toxicity, making it a promising approach in cancer therapy (Electrochemotherapy). However, is still challenging to increase therapeutic efficacy, such as increasing the amount of drug internalized by cells after EP. To address these limitations, integrating nanocarriers-particularly liposomes-into EP-based drug delivery strategies has shown great promise. Due to their structural similarity to cell membranes, liposomes can undergo electroporation without causing irreversible cell damage, enabling localized and controlled drug release at targeted sites. This study preliminary evaluates the effectiveness of positively charged gentamicin sulfate loaded liposomes (GS-Lipo) in enhancing gentamicin sulfate uptake through electroporation. The focus is on liposome behavior under EP, drug release, and cellular internalization. The results reveal a strong interplay between liposomes and EP. While EP minimally affects liposome size (sizes lower than 250\u202fnm before and after EP) and PDI, it significantly enhances intracellular uptake and drug release by creating transient pores in liposomal bilayer, facilitating gentamicin diffusion. In vitro uptake studies performed with fluorescent liposomes and GS-Lipo, confirmed superior performance when combined treatment (EP\u202f+\u202fGS-Lipo) is used. By optimizing electroporation parameters (160\u202fV, 200\u202fV, and 250\u202fV), this study succeeds in maximizing intracellular drug concentration, with the long-term goal of improving therapeutic outcomes, particularly in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aims at exploring the role of LACTB on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell differentiation. In this study, 143 colorectal cancer tissue samples were collected for analyzing the correlation between LACTB level and clinical information. Another 24 recent cases and adjacent tissues underwent qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect LACTB expression. The differentiation and proliferation of CRC cells were evaluated by AKP levels, E-cadherin expression, cell viability, colony formation, EdU assay, and cell cycle. Subcutaneous models explored LACTB's pro-differentiation effects. The glandular-like structures of tumor were observed by HE staining, immunofluorescence detection of microvilli proteins, and transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that LACTB expression in colorectal cancer tissues was lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. Higher LACTB expression was correlated with slower tumor progression, better prognosis and higher differentiation degree. Overexpressing LACTB in CRC cells enhanced differentiation markers level (AKP and E-cadherin), while inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, induced cell cycle arrest. Conversely, LACTB knockdown had an opposite effect. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor model suggested that LACTB overexpression inhibited tumor growth, induced tissue differentiation and glandular-like structures formation. Collectively, our results show that LACTB overexpression promotes cell differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in CRC cells, which may serve as a therapy target for CRC.",

Late-stage diagnosis, often accompanied by metastatic dissemination, drastically impairs patient survival and underscores the urgent need for improved biomarkers to guide therapeutic strategies. While molecular signatures have been proposed to stratify pancreatic cancer patients, their ability to predict outcomes remains limited. In this study, we applied established molecular signatures to our in-house transcriptomic data from a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. We took advantage of published datasets to construct comprehensive atlases of cells present in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers. The atlas of metastasis samples, representative of routinely harvested patient biopsies, revealed that monocyte/macrophage signatures provided superior discriminatory power compared to existing molecular classifications.

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a transformative approach for cancer therapy, enabling precise gene silencing through small interfering RNA (siRNA). However, the clinical application of siRNA-based treatments faces challenges such as rapid degradation, inefficient cellular uptake, and immune system clearance. Nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery has revolutionized cancer therapy by addressing these limitations, improving siRNA stability, tumor-specific targeting, and therapeutic efficacy. Recent advancements in nanocarrier engineering have introduced innovative strategies to enhance the safety and precision of siRNA-based therapies, offering new opportunities for personalized medicine. This review highlights three key innovations in nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery: artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nanocarrier design, multifunctional nanoparticles for combined therapeutic strategies, and biomimetic nanocarriers for enhanced biocompatibility. AI-driven nanocarriers utilize machine learning algorithms to optimize nanoparticle properties, improving drug release profiles and minimizing off-target effects. Multifunctional nanoparticles integrate siRNA with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photothermal therapy, enabling synergistic treatment approaches that enhance therapeutic outcomes and reduce drug resistance. Biomimetic nanocarriers, including exosome-mimicking systems and cell-membrane-coated nanoparticles, improve circulation time, immune evasion, and targeted tumor delivery. These innovations collectively enhance the precision, efficiency, and safety of siRNA-based cancer therapies. The scope and novelty of these advancements lie in their ability to overcome the primary barriers of siRNA delivery while paving the way for clinically viable solutions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest developments in nanocarrier fabrication, preclinical and clinical studies, and safety assessments. By integrating AI-driven design, multifunctionality, and biomimicry, nanotechnology-enhanced siRNA delivery holds immense potential for the future of precision cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapies are one potential approach to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory or relapsed disease. However, comprehensive testing in scarce primary patient material is hampered by the many drug combination possibilities. Furthermore, inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity necessitates personalized treatment optimization approaches that effectively exploit patient-specific vulnerabilities to selectively target both the disease- and resistance-driving cell populations. Here, we developed a systematic combinatorial design strategy that uses machine learning to prioritize the most promising drug combinations for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The predictive approach leveraged single-cell transcriptomics and single-agent response profiles measured in primary patient samples to identify targeted combinations that co-inhibit treatment resistant cancer cells individually in each AML patient sample. Cell type compositions evolved dynamically between the diagnostic and R/R stages uniquely in each patient, hence requiring personalized drug combination strategies to target therapy-resistant cancer cells. Cell population-specific drug combination assays demonstrated how patient-specific and disease stage-tailored combination predictions led to treatments with synergy and strong potency in R/R AML cells, while the same combinations elicited non-synergistic effects in the diagnostic stage and minimal co-inhibitory effects on normal cells. In preliminary experiments on clinical trial samples, the approach predicted clinical outcomes to venetoclax-azacitidine combination therapy in patients with AML. Overall, the computational-experimental approach provides a rational means to identify personalized combinatorial regimens for individual AML patients with R/R disease that target treatment-resistant leukemic cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical translation.",

In this study, we aimed to develop a prognostic model for endometrial cancer (EC) patients based on mitochondria-related genes (MRGs), and to investigate the role of MACC1 in EC. As shown in the graphic summary, we retrieved gene expression and clinical data from open-access databases. To construct a predictive signature, we applied the Lasso Cox regression algorithm to MRGs. The predictive performance, immune features, and anti-tumor response of the mitochondrial signature were evaluated through multiple algorithms. Additionally, expression levels of key genes were validated using quantitative Real-Time PCR and Western Blot. A total of 2030 MRGs were retrieved, and 267 were found to be prognostically relevant. Eight MRGs-MACC1, CMPK2, NDUFAF6, DUSP18, TOMM40L, MT-TP, SAMM50, and MAIP1-were identified to construct a prognostic signature for EC. The MRG signature demonstrated significant associations with drug sensitivity, immune therapy, and immune cell infiltration. Based on comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, MACC1 was identified as the most promising MRG candidate in EC. Systematic experimental validation, including both in vitro and in vivo approaches, demonstrated that MACC1\u00a0down-regulation\u00a0significantly suppressed EC progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Over 47,000 human papillomavirus (HPV) related cancers are newly diagnosed every year in the United States, yet HPV vaccination rates are below desirable levels. Young adulthood is critical for catch-up HPV vaccination. Previous research on HPV vaccine-seeking behavior among young adults is limited, particularly in Tennessee. This study aimed to understand HPV vaccine perceptions and experiences of young adults. Virtual semi-structured interviews were conducted among 18-26-year-olds at a university in Tennessee from April to May 2022 (N\u2009=\u200925). Interview questions were based on the Health Belief Model and previous literature with a focus on gaining in-depth insights into young adults' perspectives regarding HPV vaccination. Inductive and deductive thematic analysis approaches were used for data analysis. Five major themes were identified: (1) perceptions about HPV and HPV vaccination, (2) factors that may prevent HPV vaccination, (3) role of health care providers, (4) role of family and friends, and (5) HPV vaccine promotion strategies. Participants commonly discussed lack of knowledge and awareness as a factor preventing HPV vaccine uptake. Participants described some facilitators of HPV vaccination, including healthcare provider recommendations and family support, and perceived future benefits of receiving the HPV vaccine. Suggestions for promotion strategies included promotion through college health centers, community education, and awareness campaigns. Young adults' perceptions about the HPV vaccine and inadequate knowledge may influence uptake. Findings from this study showed that healthcare provider recommendations and parental support were facilitators for getting vaccinated. Future efforts may consider increasing awareness among young adults, exploring barriers to recommendation, and addressing parental concerns.",

    "title": "Exploring Barriers to Inclusivity: Systematic Analysis of Exclusion Criteria and Potential Bias in Clinical Cancer Trials for Psychiatric and Neurological Conditions in European Protocols.",
    "abstract": "Cancer clinical trials often employ exclusion criteria that can impact vulnerable populations, particularly individuals with psychological, psychiatric, or neurological conditions. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence and nature of exclusion criteria in clinical trials for prostate, breast, and lung cancers. The EU Clinical Trials Register identified 51 protocols uploaded between 2022 and 2024. Thematic content analysis categorized exclusion criteria, and the justifications provided, while frequency analysis quantified their prevalence. After excluding five protocols (two non-English and three inaccessible), the final dataset comprised 46 protocols: 13 for prostate cancer (22.8%), 24 for breast cancer (42.1%), and 9 for lung cancer (15.8%). Exclusion criteria targeting vulnerable populations were present in 78.3% of protocols, categorized into five themes: psychiatric conditions (24.6%), neurological conditions (22.8%), other psychological conditions (22.8%), legal/guardianship status (5.3%), and unspecified conditions (24.6%). Compliance concerns (39.1%) were the most common justification, followed by informed consent challenges (32.6%), safety risks (13%), drug interference (10.9%), and not in the best interest (4.3%). Notably, 29.1% of protocols lacked justification for exclusions, raising ethical and transparency concerns. The exclusion of vulnerable populations may limit the inclusivity and generalizability of cancer research. Heuristic biases and systemic practices can potentially influence this. Exploring the role of these factors and considering adaptive trial designs, along with providing detailed justifications for exclusion criteria, could support more equitable and representative clinical research.",

    "title": "Epidemiology and approaches for management of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in Gulf Countries: a narrative review and insights from the Gulf multiple myeloma experts.",
    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Although therapeutic advancements have improved clinical outcomes, this has been restricted to some high-income nations. Countries in the Gulf region, despite significant rises in gross domestic product (GDP), have resource-constrained environments and hence face unique challenges when it comes to the management of MM mainly because of the limited spending on healthcare (as a percentage of the GDP) in these countries. This narrative analysis explores the epidemiology, patient demographics, and therapeutic landscape of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in Gulf nations, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman. Our findings emphasize the growing incidence of MM in the region, with increased mortality rates owing to delayed diagnosis, restricted access to some of the advanced medicines in few areas, and disparities in care. Patients in the Gulf countries usually present at a younger age than their global counterparts, with median ages of diagnosis ranging from 43 to 58\u2009years. Access to innovative treatments like CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies has been limited by high costs and infrastructural barriers. Stem-cell transplantation, although available in most countries, is insufficiently utilized, and treatment approaches frequently depend on conventional medicines. Obstacles to prompt diagnosis, difficulty in accessing treatment centers, limited availability of innovative treatment, and inadequate regional monitoring protocols, impede efficient illness management. Insights from the Gulf MM Advisory Board highlight the need for individualized treatment protocols, enhanced accessibility to novel treatments, and improvements in healthcare infrastructure. Cooperative initiatives among healthcare professionals, decision makers, and industry stakeholders are crucial for formulating regional treatment protocols and enhancing clinical trial networks. Reflecting on these shortcomings will be critical to improving patient outcomes and aligning MM care in the Gulf region with international standards. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a blood cancer caused by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells, leading to serious health issues. While treatment has improved in some developed countries, Gulf nations face challenges due to limited healthcare spending. This analysis looks at MM in the Gulf countries: UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman.MM usually affects older people globally, but in the Gulf, patients are diagnosed younger, between 43 and 58\u2009years old. The incidence of MM is rising in the region, with higher death rates due to late diagnosis, limited access to advanced medicines, and unequal care. Innovative treatments like CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies are expensive and hard to access. Stem-cell transplants are available but underused, and conventional medicines are often relied upon.Challenges in MM management in the Gulf include late diagnosis, limited access to advanced therapies, and inconsistent treatment practices. High costs and logistical issues restrict the use of new immunotherapies. Lack of standardized monitoring and healthcare disparities further hinder outcomes.The Gulf MM Advisory Board highlights the need for personalized treatment protocols, better access to new treatments, and improved healthcare infrastructure. Collaborative efforts are key to developing regional treatment protocols and strengthening clinical trial networks, which will enhance patient outcomes and align MM care in the Gulf with international standards.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that microbes located within the gastrointestinal tract and other anatomical locations influence the development and progression of diseases such as cancer. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that microbes in the gastrointestinal tract and other anatomical locations, such as the respiratory tract, may affect carcinogenesis, development of metastases, cancer treatment response, and cancer treatment-related adverse effects. Within tumors of patients with cancer, microbes may affect response to treatment, and therapies that reduce or eliminate these microbes may improve outcomes in patients with cancer. Modulating gastrointestinal tract (gut) microbes through fecal microbiota transplant and other strategies such as dietary intervention (eg, high-fiber diet intervention) has improved outcomes in small studies of patients treated with cancer immunotherapy. In contrast, disruption of the gut microbiota by receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to treatment with cancer immunotherapy has been associated with poorer overall survival and higher rates of adverse effects in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade for solid tumors and also with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for hematologic malignancies. Microbes in the gut and other locations in the body may influence the development and progression of cancer and may affect the response to adverse effects from cancer therapy. Future therapies targeting microbes in the gut and other locations in the body could potentially improve outcomes in patients with cancer.",

    "abstract": "National guidelines recommend next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumors in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) to identify potential actionable alterations. Non-Hispanic Black men are poorly represented in precision oncology cohorts, and therefore differences in alterations frequencies between non-Hispanic Black and White men remain poorly characterized. To describe the spectrum and frequency of alterations in PCa-related genes and pathways, as well as associations with self-identified race and ethnicity and overall survival in US veterans. This retrospective cohort study compared alteration frequencies between non-Hispanic Black and White men who underwent NGS testing from January 23, 2019, to November 2, 2023, adjusted by NGS analyte and clinicopathologic covariates. The analytic data file was locked on December 8, 2023. NGS testing was performed through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Precision Oncology Program, part of the largest near-equal access integrated health care system in the US. Pathogenic alterations identified by NGS testing with a commercially available NGS platform. The primary outcome consisted of alteration frequencies in individual genes, actionable targets, and canonical prostate cancer pathways. Associations between alteration frequency and race and ethnicity as well as survival were also examined. A total of 5015 veterans with mPCa who underwent NGS were included (1784 non-Hispanic Black [35.6%] and 3231 non-Hispanic White [64.4%]; mean [SD] age, 67.4 [9.0] years). Non-Hispanic Black veterans were younger, had higher prostate-specific antigen levels at diagnosis, were less likely to report Agent Orange exposure, and resided in more deprived neighborhoods compared with non-Hispanic White veterans. Nine of the top 10 most commonly altered genes were the same in non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White veterans; however, the frequencies of alterations varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity was associated with higher odds of genomic alterations in SPOP (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6) as well as immunotherapy targets (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5) including high microsatellite instability status (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-9.4). Furthermore, non-Hispanic Black race and ethnicity was associated with lower odds of genomic alterations in the AKT/PI3K pathway (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7), androgen receptor axis (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9), and tumor suppressor genes (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8). Cox proportional hazards modeling stratified by race and ethnicity found that alterations in tumor suppressor genes, including TP53, were associated with shorter overall survival in both non-Hispanic Black (hazards ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13-2.11) and non-Hispanic White (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.85) veterans. This retrospective clinical genomic profiling cohort study with a large total and proportional representation of non-Hispanic Black men with mPCa reported significant differences in alteration frequencies from key oncogenic pathways but similar survival rates in the near equal-access VA health care setting. This analysis suggests the utility of genomic testing for identifying candidates irrespective of race and ethnicity for precision oncology treatments, which could contribute to equitable outcomes in patients with mPCa.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic options for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remain a significant challenge. This analysis compared outcomes of anlotinib plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone in this population using the pooled data from two prospective randomized trials (ALTER-L016; ALTER-L018). Adult patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 wild-type advanced NSCLC progressing on first-line ICIs were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to anlotinib plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Seventy-one patients were included in this pooled analysis (L016, n\u2009=\u200939; L018, n\u2009=\u200932), of whom, 40 received anlotinib plus docetaxel and 31 received docetaxel. The median follow-up of all patients was 27.0\u00a0months. The median PFS was longer with anlotinib plus docetaxel than with docetaxel alone (5.4\u00a0months [95% CI 5.0-9.3] vs. 2.3\u00a0months [95% CI 1.4-2.9]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.34; 95% CI 0.18-0.63; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Both ORR (25.0% vs. 12.9%) and DCR (82.5% vs. 45.2%) were higher in the anlotinib plus docetaxel group than in the docetaxel group. Median OS was 16.2\u00a0months (95% CI 8.3-21.3) with anlotinib plus docetaxel versus 13.7\u00a0months (95% CI 4.6-22.3) with docetaxel (HR\u2009=\u20090.82; 95% CI 0.47-1.44; P\u2009=\u20090.488). Subsequent ICI therapy was associated with a longer OS. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32.5% of patients receiving anlotinib plus docetaxel and 6.5% of patients receiving docetaxel. Anlotinib plus docetaxel improved PFS but not OS versus docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC progressing on ICIs. Larger standardized phase 3 trials are needed to verify these findings.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive disease that poses a significant threat to human health. Although conventional chemotherapy remains an effective treatment, it is often associated with severe side effects, underscoring the need for more effective cancer therapies. In this study, we analyzed the keywords of past studies, the countries with the highest number of publications, the leading journals, prominent authors, and collaborations between countries, authors, and journals, as well as the impact factors of relevant literature. The aim was to explore the trends in the use of nanomaterials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, enabling researchers to review past achievements and gain a better understanding of future research directions. Relevant research articles were sourced from core Web of Science databases, and VOSviewer and CiteSpace visualization tools were employed to reveal the intrinsic links between the information. Research on the use of nanomaterials for the therapy of pancreatic cancer has been growing since the twenty-first century, particularly from 2018 to the present. The United States has become a leader in this field, with the highest number of publications and the most published authors. Additionally, a 2018 study published in Nature demonstrated that patients with insufficient CD8\u2009+\u2009T-cell infiltration in the pancreatic cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) had significantly lower survival rates (HR\u2009=\u20092.5, p\u2009<\u20090.001). And CSF1R inhibitors combined with a PD-1 antibody resulted in 60% tumor shrinkage in a mouse model. These findings suggest that research on the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy is poised to be a key focus of future studies, offering new hope for pancreatic cancer patients.",

It helps tumor cells maintain homeostasis, resist cell death, and contribute to therapy failure. This study analyzed the literature related to autophagy and tumor drug resistance based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The results revealed that there are 9284 relevant articles published to date, covering 103 countries and regions, with contributions from 5964 institutions and 37,240 researchers. The annual number of publications has steadily increased since 2004, especially after 2019, indicating the growing importance of autophagy in tumor drug resistance research. China leads globally in terms of publication output, accounting for nearly 50% of the total publications. Additionally, international collaboration and cross-country research have become increasingly prominent, particularly collaborations between China and countries like South Korea and Japan. Journal analysis showed that the International Journal of Molecular Sciences and Oncotarget are the most productive journals, while Autophagy stands out with a higher impact factor. Author, citation, and keyword analyses revealed research hotspots and future trends in the field of autophagy and tumor drug resistance, including chemotherapy resistance, cell death mechanisms, and immunotherapy.

    "abstract": "CD8T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, play a key role in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and immune response. The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of CD8T cell-associated biomarkers in predicting prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in ovarian cancer. The single-cell sequencing data from the EMTAB8107 cohort were used to identify CD8 T-cell subtypes. The TCGA-OV cohort was involved in constructing a machine learning-based CD8T cell-associated index (CCAI). Additionally, independent ovarian cancer cohorts GSE26712 and GSE26193 were used to validate the predictive validity of CCAI. Multifactorial Cox regression and ROC analysis were applied to assess CCAI. The STRING database was used to clarify the interactions of CD8 T-cell-associated molecules. Furthermore, immune landscape analysis was performed using CIBERSORT, ssGSEA, TIMER, and ESTIMATE algorithms. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis and drug sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate the potential predictive value of CCAI. The CCAI, comprising LRP1, PLAUR, OGN, TAP1, ISG20, CXCR4, IL2RG, LCK, and CD3G, serves as a reliable prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patients, demonstrating robust predictive accuracy across various patient cohorts. Notably, individuals with low CCAI tend to exhibit immunoinflammatory tumor characteristics. The developed CCAI serves as a promising prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer, accurately predicting patient outcomes. Additionally, it differentiates between patients with distinct immune landscape profiles. This insight enables personalized treatment strategies and facilitates the exploration of underlying mechanisms involving CCAI-related molecules.",

The integration of chitosan with various nanomaterials-including magnetic nanoparticles, carbon-based structures such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, and gold nanoparticles-offers distinct advantages in thermal conversion efficiency, tumor specificity, and drug delivery potential. Magnetic nanoparticles allow precise thermal ablation of cancer cells under an external magnetic field, while carbon-based materials provide superior thermal conductivity for efficient heat generation. Gold nanoparticles, when conjugated with chitosan, improve biocompatibility and enable surface modification for targeted therapy. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, challenges remain in terms of toxicity, long-term stability, regulatory approval, and scalable synthesis. This review critically examines these aspects and outlines future directions for optimizing chitosan-based nanocomposites toward clinical translation and commercial viability in cancer hyperthermia therapy.",

    "abstract": "Young breast cancer patients with germline radiosensitivity mutations, such as in TP53 and ATM, face an increased risk of radiation-induced toxicities and secondary malignancies. Proton therapy offers dosimetric advantages by reducing the radiation exposure of healthy tissues, potentially mitigating these risks. However, clinical data on the use of proton therapy in this specific population are limited. We conducted a\u00a0single-center retrospective study in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer with germline TP53 or ATM mutations treated with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) at the Institut Curie Proton Therapy Center between June 2019 and November 2024. Patient demographics, treatment characteristics, and toxicity profiles were analyzed. Acute and late toxicities were graded according to CTCAE v5.0. Survival outcomes were calculated from the date of histological diagnosis. Four young patients (median age\u00a025\u00a0years; range 24-29) with TP53 (n\u202f=\u20092) or ATM (n\u202f=\u20092) mutations received IMPT targeting the chest wall and regional lymph nodes. All patients had hormone receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer; one patient was also HER2 positive. Treatments included chemotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant hormonal therapy; three patients received additional targeted therapies. The median mean heart dose was 1.25\u202fGy (range 0.5-1.5\u202fGy). One patient experienced acute grade\u00a02 radiodermatitis, while two patients had grade\u00a01 radiodermatitis. After a\u00a0median follow-up of 18\u00a0months (range 11-49\u00a0months), one patient exhibited persistent grade\u00a01 skin pigmentation. No other late toxicities, including cardiac or pulmonary complications, were observed. There were no secondary malignancies or recurrences, resulting in 100% overall and recurrence-free survival. Proton therapy was well tolerated in this small cohort of young breast cancer patients with germline TP53 or ATM mutations, demonstrating minimal acute toxicity and no significant late effects over a\u00a0median follow-up of 18\u00a0months. These preliminary findings suggest that proton therapy may be a\u00a0safe treatment option for this high-risk population. Larger studies with extended follow-up are necessary to confirm these results and to inform clinical guidelines.",

Despite its clinical utility as a companion diagnostic for ICI across cancers, high TMB does not consistently predict response due to technical and biological limitations. Tumor heterogeneity and purity, blood vs. tissue sampling, variation in next generation sequencing and algorithmic evaluation attenuate the predictive value of TMB. In addition to technical standardization and moving beyond TMB as a numeric or binarized value, it is of paramount importance to consider the underlying biology and differential contribution of mutation subsets to tumor foreignness and immunogenicity. The importance of consideration of mutations within the overall TMB that are unlikely to be immunoedited together with the density of immunogenic \"quality\" mutation-associated neoantigens introduce the concept of biological calibration of TMB that may enhance its clinical utility. Mutagenic processes such as microsatellite instability and ultra-mutation and cancer lineage-dependent co-mutation patterns also represent biological modifiers that enable the interpretation of the overall TMB in different contexts. In this perspective, we dissect TMB on a biological and technical level followed by a critical assessment of the predictive role of TMB in capturing ICI response in the setting of clinical trials across human cancers. Standardization of technical methodologies together with the interpretation of TMB on the basis of the tumor genomic landscape represent key steps towards maximizing the predictive value of TMB for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy is the main treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, low survival rates highlight the necessity for new therapeutic strategies. Drug repurposing has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, with various studies proposing the use of existing drugs for the treatment of bladder cancer (BC). In this context, we previously established an in silico repurposing strategy using patient -omics signatures, identifying drugs and compounds with the potential to reverse non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) to less aggressive subtypes. In the present study, we expanded our in silico approach to verify a list of compounds with potential anti-tumor activity against MIBC. We investigated the efficacy of the predicted candidates in a group of different BC cell lines, including NMIBC and MIBC. The most potent compound for decreasing cell viability was amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic drug widely used in the field of cardiology. Amiodarone reduced cell proliferation and colony formation capacity, with a stronger effect on the most aggressive invasive models, validating our repurposing pipeline. The drug additionally induced cell death and inhibited the activity of mTOR and its target protein S6, suggesting that the anti-cancer effect of the drug is in part mediated by inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, the administration of amiodarone in a xenograft MIBC mouse model reduced tumor growth without inducing toxicity. Altogether, we demonstrated that amiodarone is a potential repurposed drug for BC, which might be especially effective in MIBC.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) produce enhanced anti-tumor activity in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sitravatinib is a novel multi-target TKI that targets TYRO3, AXL, MERTK (TAM) receptors, c-MET, etc. This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor efficacy and immunomodulatory activity of sitravatinib in HCC. Human HCC cell lines and xenograft models were used to explore the anti-tumor activity of sitravatinib. Subcutaneous and orthotopic immunocompetent murine HCC models were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of sitravatinib and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. Co-cultures for tumor cells and T cells were performed to verify the immunomodulatory effect of sitravatinib in tumors. Sitravatinib showed potent anti-tumor activity and immunomodulatory capabilities from in vitro to in vivo. Sitravatinib treatment synergized with PD-1 blockade to generate an increased anti-tumor efficacy, leading to significant enrichment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells as well as reduction of Treg cells infiltration in tumors. Mechanically, on one hand, sitravatinib reinforced MHC-I expression by blocking TYRO3-STAT1 axis, thereby sensitizing tumor cells to T cell liking. On the other hand, sitravatinib suppressed tumor-secreted IL33 by inhibiting TYRO3 activity in HCC cells, resulting in reduced Treg cells differentiation and consequently liberating CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity. In the clinic, one advanced HCC patient treated with Sitravatinib plus PD-1 blockade achieved near complete response and remains disease progression-free for more than two years. Collectively, we demonstrated a rationale for combining sitravatinib with PD-1 blockade in the treatment for HCC.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib, which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), show considerable therapeutic effectiveness in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations. Nevertheless, the resistance that develops against EGFR-TKIs diminishes their therapeutic impact in clinical settings. This investigation focused on the impact of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) on gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. Using the CCK-8 assay, the influence of different gefitinib concentrations on cell proliferation was examined. eIF4E and EGFR expressions were verified by qRT-PCR and/or western blotting in NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, the effects of eIF4E knockdown in gefitinib-treated PC9/GR cells were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry, colony formation assays, and xenograft tumor model. eIF4E expression was remarkably upregulated in the gefitinib-resistant PC9/GR cells. Moreover, the expression levels of eIF4E in NSCLC cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent increase following gefitinib administration. The function assays demonstrated that reducing eIF4E levels hindered the proliferation of PC9/GR cells and enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effects of gefitinib both in vitro and in vivo, and also had an inhibitory action on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that eIF4E confers gefitinib resistance in NSCLC by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Therefore, eIF4E is a possible therapeutic target for improving therapeutic action in NSCLC patients who have developed resistance to gefitinib.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of patients with CLL has undergone significant changes in recent years. Standard chemoimmunotherapy is changing to targeted inhibition with modern drugs. The listed drugs have better efficacy and significantly improve the overall survival of patients according to registry clinical studies. In a retrospective analysis, we evaluated 43 patients with CLL who underwent venetoclax treatment at the Hematology Department, University Hospital and Polyclinic F. D. Roosevelt Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Slovakia (FNsP FDR BB) in 2019-2024. The aim of this work was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in the treatment of patients with CLL. The median age of patients at the time of initiation of venetoclax treatment was 58 years, range 41-79 years. The majority of patients, 27 (63%) were men and 16 (37%) were women. Patients were treated with venetoclax in the first and higher line, in combination with obinutuzumab, with rituximab, and in monotherapy. Of these, 16 (37%) patients were after previous treatment with ibrutinib. Treatment indications and response assessment were based on the 2018 international workshop on the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Criteria. Patients were evaluated after at least 2 months of treatment until disease progression. The effect of treatment was assessed by objective examination of the patient, possibly by imaging examination (USG, CT scan) and evaluation of blood parameters. Adverse effects were assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. In case of disease progression, treatment was interrupted. The results of our work confirmed the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab, and rituximab, even as monotherapy in patients with CLL. The efficacy of the above regimens in our group of patients is comparable to that in clinical studies, even in patients with high-risk genetic features, such as 17p deletion and unmutated IgVH status. Treatment with venetoclax was also effective and well tolerated in patients after previous treatment with ibrutinib. The limitations of our evaluation are the small patient population and the short median follow-up of patients. In line with the conclusions of clinical trials and retrospective analysis from real-life practice, we can say that venetoclax-based treatment regimens are highly effective in patients with CLL in the first and higher line of treatment, with acceptable and well-manageable toxicity. This treatment is also effective in patients after previous treatment with ibrutinib.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 which reinvigorate T cells for tumor control have become standard-of-care treatment options. In response to the increasingly recognized mechanisms of resistance to T cell activation in immunologically cold tumors, immuno-oncology drug development has started to shift beyond T cell approaches. These include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major pro-tumor immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment known to silence immune responses. Here we outline anti-TAM therapies in current development, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities. We describe emerging drugs targeting TAMs under investigation in phase II and III testing with a focus on their distinguishing mechanism of action which include (1) reprogramming of TAMs toward anti-tumor function and immune surveillance, (2) blockade of recruitment, and (3) reduction and ablation of TAMs. Several new immuno-oncology agents are under investigation to harness anti-tumor functions of TAMs. While robust anti-tumor efficacy of anti-TAM therapies across advanced solid organ cancers remains elusive to-date, TAM reprogramming therapies have yielded benefits in select cancers. The inherent heterogeneity of the diverse TAM population will require enhanced investments into biomarker-driven approaches to fully leverage its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "MAX dimerization (MXD) genes play integral roles in various types of tumors. The expression patterns, prognostic value, potential mechanisms, and roles in immunotherapy of MXD genes in gastric cancer (GC) remain not fully elucidated. We aimed to explore the role of MXDs in GC. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were employed to evaluate the differential expression of the MXD gene family members in GC tissues compared to non-paired normal gastric tissues. cBioPortal was utilized for examining genetic alterations within the MXD gene family. R software, specifically version 3.6.3, was used to scrutinize the expression patterns of MXD genes in GC, their correlation with clinical parameters, and to generate a correlation heat map. The survival package (v3.2-10) and the Cox regression model were implemented to evaluate the prognostic significance of the MXD gene family. The pROC package (v1.17.0.1) was applied to assess the diagnostic potential of the MXD gene family. R software (v3.6.3) was also used to explore potential regulatory networks involving members of the MXD gene family and related genes. The GSVA package (v1.34.0) was leveraged to investigate the link between the expression of the MXD gene family and immune cell infiltration. Visualization was facilitated by the ggplot2 (v3.3.3), survminer (v0.4.9), and clusterProfiler (v3.14.3) packages. Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) was employed to determine the sensitivity of the MXD gene family's expression to drugs from the GDSC database. The expression levels of MXD genes were validated across various cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). MXD1 was significantly upregulated in GC, while MXD3 and MXD4 were significantly downregulated. Significant correlations were identified between the expression levels of MXD3 and the T stage (p = 0.041) and age (p = 0.001) of GC patients. Additionally, a notable association was observed between MXD4 expression and the histologic grade (p = 0.006) in GC patients. Low MXD3 expression was associated with a poor prognosis in GC. Low MXD3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes in GC patients. MXD3 demonstrated some accuracy in predicting tumor and normal tissue outcomes (AUC = 0.884). MXDs mediate gastric carcinogenesis and progression by regulating immune cells and pathways, including endocytosis, cell cycle, and apoptosis. The expression of the MXD gene family was associated with immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity. MXD3 and MXD4 expression levels were significantly downregulated in GC cell lines, while MXD1 expression was significantly upregulated. The MXD gene family may serve as novel biomarkers of poor prognosis and as potential immunotherapeutic targets for GC.",

This study aims to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of glioma development and explore possible miRNAs as targets for glioma prognosis and molecular therapy. RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression of miR-3188 in glioma tissues and cells. The relationship between miR-3188 and pathological features, as well as its prognostic importance, were examined using the chisquare test and Cox regression analysis. The dual luciferase reporting assay was utilized to confirm the targeting of miR-3188 and MAPK1. Transwell assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were used to identify the roles that miR-3188 plays in cell metastasis and proliferation, respectively. Research has revealed downregulation of miR-3188 in the tissues and cells of glioma, which is strongly correlated with the tumor size, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, World Health Organization (WHO) grade, and patients' survival rate in glioma. Four downstream target genes were screened by bioinformatics analysis, among which MAPK1 was abnormally expressed in glioma, and was negatively correlated with miR-3188. When miR-3188 was overexpressed, the malignant behavioral activity of glioma cells was significantly decreased; however, the inhibitory effect was reversed when MAPK1 was overexpressed. miR-3188 is a potential predictor of malignant development and poor prognosis in glioma patients and targets MAPK1 to inhibit the progression of glioma.",

    "title": "Inhibition of Purine Metabolism Promotes the Differentiation of Neuroblastoma Driven by MYCN.",
    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB), the common extracranial solid tumor in children, is associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in high-risk patients. MYCN amplification stands as the most prominent molecular hallmark within this high-risk subgroup. However, MYCN protein is considered \"undruggable\" due to its lack of a conventional enzymatic binding pocket and its predominant nuclear localization, which precludes targeting by standard small-molecule inhibitors or antibody-based therapeutics. Consequently, current therapeutic strategies have achieved limited efficacy against MYCN-driven NB. Notably, MYCN not only orchestrates diverse metabolic reprogramming pathways in tumors but also exerts a pivotal influence on cellular differentiation. To overcome this therapeutic barrier, we seek to elucidate the contribution of purine metabolism to stemness maintenance in MYCN-amplified NBs and to discover novel small-molecule inhibitors capable of inducing differentiation in high-risk NBs. Metabolomic profiling via mass spectrometry was employed to delineate differential metabolite signatures between MYCN-amplified and non-amplified NB cells. Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing datasets facilitated the systematic evaluation of purine metabolic enzyme expression. Cell differentiation, proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration assays were employed to assess the inhibitor's effects. Additionally, an in\u00a0vivo xenograft model of NB was established to examine the therapeutic potential of lometrexol (LMX), a selective inhibitor of the purine biosynthesis enzyme phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART). Significant changes in nucleotide metabolism were identified in NB cell lines with high MYCN expression compared to those with low MYCN expression. The expression of purine metabolic enzyme genes was positively correlated with MYCN expression, prognosis, and differentiation status in NBs. Pharmacological inhibition of GART using LMX elicited a robust pro-differentiation response, concomitant with a significant suppression of tumorigenic potential. These findings establish purine metabolic enzyme inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy to induce differentiation and attenuate tumor progression in high-risk MYCN-amplified NBs.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of immunotherapy with tumor associated antigen vaccines can be enhanced by combining oncolytic viruses with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study evaluates the efficacy of oncolytic reovirus in combination with an adenovector expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (Ad-CEA) and a programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor in a mouse model. Mice bearing CEA-expressing CT26 tumor cells were immunized with Ad-CEA along with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Subsequently, three doses of reovirus were injected into the tumors. Tumor size, histopathological examination, CD8 and FOXP3 expression, the cytotoxicity of spleen T cell lymphocytes, and the secretion of Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and Tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were examined. The triple therapy used in this study resulted in the lowest tumor growth and the highest level of cytotoxic immunity. The Foxp3 levels in the tumor microenvironment and TNF-\u03b1 secretion decreased compared to other control groups. Additionally, this group exhibited the lowest number of mitotic figures and the highest amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The combination of tumor vaccines with oncolytic viruses significantly improves treatment efficacy. Furthermore, inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction during vaccination and also with virotherapy enhances immunovirotherapy by reducing immunosuppressive effects and stimulating the immune system, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer with poor outcomes for advanced cases, highlighting the need for better treatments. One promising approach is cancer immunotherapy, that can activate the immune system against Tumor-associated antigens (TAA). TAAs overexpress on tumor cells, but are also expressed at lower levels on some healthy cells.. Many cancer patients struggle with a weak immune response due to tolerance to TAAs, which are often overexpressed in tumors but fail to trigger a strong immune reaction. One specific TAA, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is notably overexpressed in CRC and has been targeted by various cancer vaccines, including those using recombinant adenoviruses that have been genetically modified in a way to acquire a new characteristic or to express a new protein. This viral platform is favored for its safety, stability, and ability to induce strong immune responses. CEA is significant in cancer progression and immune response, making it a key target for therapies aimed at activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of lymphocytes that can kill certain cells, including foreign, tumor and infected cells. Tumors are categorized as \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d based on immune cell presence. Hot tumors have high levels of immune cell infiltration and neoantigens, (unique proteins that appear on cancer cells), which help provoke strong immune responses. Strategies to convert cold tumors into hot ones could enhance treatment effectiveness. Despite advances in immunotherapy, CRC still shows limited response. Researchers are investigating combination therapies that pair immunotherapy with other treatments like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies to improve outcomes. One such combination involves oncolytic viruses like reovirus, which selectively infects and kills cancer cells. This approach could enhance the overall effectiveness of CRC treatments. In addition, blocking the programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) interaction, which negatively regulates immune response by inhibiting the activity of effector T cells can improve the efficiency of CD8 effector cells as the cells that actively respond to a target cell displaying a specific antigen.",

In this study, we conducted high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs to discover potential YAP modulators. Using a NanoBiT-based system, which enables real-time and quantitative measurement of protein interactions, combined with phenotype-based assays in EGFP-YAP-expressing cells, we identified compounds that activate or inhibit YAP function. Among the identified YAP regulators, the microtubule destabilizer vinorelbine promoted YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional activation, while the antipsychotic drug thioridazine enhanced YAP phosphorylation at Ser127, resulting in its cytoplasmic retention and reduced transcriptional activity, effectively suppressing cancer cell growth. These findings demonstrate the potential of FDA-approved drugs in modulating YAP activity and present a novel screening strategy for developing YAP-targeting therapeutics. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to identify modulators of other signaling pathways, advancing drug discovery for a wide range of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the 4th most prevalent cancer in women. Despite its global health impact, cervical cancer research has achieved limited success with various therapies (chemo, radio, chemo-radio, surgery, etc.). Recent decades have seen no improvement in survival rates due to cancer recurrence and long-term health concerns. These treatments show the need for a new herbal approach as alternative therapy for cancer. Piperlongumine is one of numerous perfected phytochemicals with anticancerous properties. In this study, in silico simulations demonstrate various novel properties of Piperlongumine. Molecular docking was performed between receptor and ligand by simulating molecular interactions in the pro and anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist/killer (Bak). The docking scores of Piperlongumine with Bcl-2, Bak, and Bax are -7.02, -6.78, and -7.54\u202fkcal/mol, respectively. Piperlongumine was also bio-tested for anticancer activities against cervical cancer cells (SiHa). Piperlongumine showed compromised cell viability, promoted apoptosis, higher nuclear condensation, reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in reactive oxygen species level, promoted cell cycle arrest, upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene whereas downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes.

    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also called brittle bone disease, is a genetic osteodysplasia characterized by a defect in type 1 collagen. Often diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, young patients are affected by frequent fractures. Osteogenesis imperfecta was first named almost 200\u00a0yr ago, yet there are still no FDA-approved treatments for OI, and existing treatments target only the skeletal defects of the disease. In this review, we briefly examine current treatments and ongoing clinical trials. Then, by analyzing OI with an osteoimmunological perspective, we have compiled evidence that OI has an autoimmune component. This autoimmune component of OI remains unconsidered, even though an immunology-based therapy has shown promise in treating OI. Acknowledging an autoimmune component of OI is critical to understanding its mechanisms and allowing for the development of more efficacious treatments and novel immunotherapies. Considering the existing literature and the growing impact of immunotherapeutic therapies in cancer and other autoimmune diseases, we believe it may be time to rethink the immune aspects of this genetic disorder and develop novel immunomodulating strategies to improve the quality of life for OI patients.",

Recent research has indicated that junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML) enhances the antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells. Our study investigates the role of JAML+ CD8+ T cells in HCC. We utilized time-of-flight mass cytometry and an orthotopic mouse model of HCC to examine histone modifications in tumor-infiltrating immune cells undergoing immunotherapy. Flow cytometry was used to assess CD4+ T cells differentiation and JAML expression in CD8+ T cells infiltrating HCC. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between lactate dehydrogenase A+ (LDHA+) CD4+ T cells and JAML+ CD8+ T cells. Subsequently, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of an agonistic anti-JAML antibody, both alone and combined with immunotherapy. Finally, RNA sequencing was conducted to identify potential regulatory mechanisms. Immunotherapy significantly increased the percentage of CD8+ T cells infiltrating HCC and induced histone modifications, such as H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) in CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that lactate promotes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. LDHA, an enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate, plays a key role in this process. Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between LDHA+ CD4+ T cells and JAML+ CD8+ T cells in patients who responded to immunotherapy. Moreover, high JAML expression in CD8+ T cells was associated with a more favorable prognosis.  Activation of JAML enhances CTL responses in HCC treatment, independent of \u03b1PD-L1-mediated immunotherapy, providing a promising strategy for advanced HCC.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a neurotransmitter known for its roles in the central nervous system, showing dual effects in various pathological conditions, including tumor progression and wound healing. This review explores the complex and context-dependent actions of 5-HT, highlighting its contrasting roles in promoting tumor growth and facilitating wound repair. 5-HT can enhance tumor growth, survival, and metastasis via its receptors, but it also accelerates wound healing by stimulating cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. This duality emphasizes the intricate balance of 5-HT and its receptors in the body. We discuss the synthesis, storage, secretion, and metabolism of 5-HT, as well as the classification and mechanisms of its receptors (5-HTRs) in different cell types under pathological conditions. We further examine the potential roles of 5-HT in both tumor progress and wound healing, proposing targeted strategies for each disease state. For tumors, \"blocking therapy\" involving receptor antagonists or gene silencing may inhibit tumor progression, while \"activation therapy\" can stimulate wound healing by enhancing receptor activation on skin cells. Challenges in clinical application, including issues related to targeting, specificity, and dosage, are addressed, alongside the promise of nanotechnology for improving targeted drug delivery. The review also explores emerging research on 5-HT's interaction with the immune system, offering insights into potential immunotherapeutic strategies for both cancer and wound healing. By balancing 5-HT's diverse effects, personalized treatments can be developed to optimize therapeutic outcomes in both contexts.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) is one of the most common endocrine system tumors, and its incidence continues to increase worldwide. Although most TC patients have a good prognosis, especially with continuous advancements in surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy, the effectiveness of disease treatment has significantly improved. However, there are still some cases with a higher risk of death and greater aggressiveness. In these more challenging advanced or highly aggressive cases, tyrosine kinase inhibitors appear to be an effective treatment option. Unfortunately, these drugs are less than ideal in terms of efficacy because of their toxicity and potential for intrinsic or acquired resistance. Therefore, exploring new strategies targeting the metabolic characteristics of TC cells and overcoming drug resistance barriers in existing treatments have become key topics in the current field of TC research. In recent years, lipid metabolic reprogramming has gained attention as an important aspect of cancer development. Lipid metabolic reprogramming not only participates in the formation of the cell membrane structure, but also plays an important role in signal transduction and promoting cell proliferation. In particular, fatty acid (FA) metabolic reprogramming has attracted widespread attention and plays an important role in multiple aspects such as tumor growth, metastasis, enhanced invasive ability, immune escape, and drug resistance. Although TC is considered a disease that is highly dependent on specific types of metabolic activities, a comprehensive understanding of the specific mechanism of action of FA metabolic reprogramming in this process is lacking. This article aims to review how FA metabolic reprogramming participates in the occurrence and development of TC, focusing on the impact of abnormal FA metabolic pathways and changes in the expression and regulation of related genes over the course of this disease. By examining the complex interactions between FA metabolic disorders and carcinogenic signaling pathways in depth, we aim to identify new therapeutic targets and develop more precise and effective treatments for TC.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box ATPase 10 (DDX10), a prominent RNA-binding protein in the DDX family, has a critical function in cancer progression. Nevertheless, its well-defined mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are still not well understood. Here, we identify that DDX10 is substantially increased in OSCC, which is positively correlated with poor prognosis and malignant behavior. Mechanistically, we found that DDX10 had physical interaction with Rab27b by undergoing phase separation. Knockdown of DDX10 inhibited Rab27b-mediated exosome secretion and the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) within its contents. Furthermore, knocking down DDX10 could restore the function and infiltration of T cells, hence inhibiting the progression of OSCC. These findings highlight that the oncogenic role of DDX10 in promoting exosomal PD-L1 secretion via phase separation with Rab27b has been preliminarily validated in T cell exhaustion in OSCC. A potential strategy for improving OSCC immunotherapy may involve the inhibition of DDX10.",

Teclistamab, a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) \u00d7 CD3 bispecific antibody, has shown promising results in clinical trials and real-world studies. PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and meeting libraries were searched from inception to 14 November 2024. The assessed outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, time to next treatment, duration of response, overall response rate (ORR), \u2265complete response (\u2265CR), \u2265very good partial response (\u2265VGPR), VGPR, partial response, and adverse events. In total, 34 studies involving 4,064 patients were included. In pairwise meta-analysis, teclistamab demonstrated superior OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54-0.89; p = 0.037] compared to existing RRMM treatments. Real-world studies showed comparable ORR (62%, 95% CI: 58%-66%) but slightly lower survival outcomes, possibly because of shorter follow-up times and higher-risk populations. Subgroup analyses revealed enhanced efficacy with combination therapies (ORR: 85% vs 62%, p < 0.0001) and notable clinical benefits in the China cohort (\u2265VGPR: 77%, \u2265CR: 58%). Safety profiles indicated manageable cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, though infection risks required vigilant management. Teclistamab continues to be a promising and effective treatment option for RRMM patients, including those previously exposed to BCMA-targeted therapies, and offers new hope for overcoming resistance and achieving better early disease control.

Cemiplimab, along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhances T cell activation by blocking the PD-1 pathway, resulting in notable improvements in clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of the patients with advanced cSCC remain unresponsive to this therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the importance of finding innovative therapeutic targets and strategies to boost the success of immunotherapy across a wider range of patients. Therefore, we focused on frequently neglected functions of innate immune cells. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, fundamentally contributing to tumor initiation and development. The identification and eradication of cancer cells, along with the modulation of adaptive immune responses, are essential roles of these cells. Consequently, targeting innate immune cells to activate anti-tumor immune responses presents significant potential for enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies in cSCC.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles that undertake the majority of the energetic and metabolic processes within the cell. They are also responsible for mediating multiple apoptotic pathways, balancing redox charges, and scavenging reactive oxygen species. MicroRNAs, which are short, non-coding RNAs widely known for regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, regulate many of these processes. The specific microRNAs that directly or indirectly control mitochondrial dynamics are called mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). The broadest classification of this type of ncRNA encompasses nuclear-encoded miRNAs that interact with cytoplasmatic mRNAs associated with mitochondrial activity. At the same time, a more specific subset comprises nuclear-encoded miRNAs that translocate into the mitochondria to interact with mRNAs inside of this organelle. Finally, the smallest group of mitomiRs includes those codified by mtDNA and can regulate endogenous mitochondrial transcripts or be transported into the cytoplasm to modulate circulating mRNAs. Regardless of the origin or action mechanism, mitomiRs have been recently recognized to have a key role in the progression of a variety of chronic disorders, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma, depression, and even cancer. All of these progressive pathologies have been tightly linked to mitochondrial dysregulation. They are further associated with an aberrant expression of specific miRNAs that regulate cellular metabolism, positioning mitomiRs as reliable biomarkers for diagnosing several chronic diseases. These molecular indicators have also provided insights into how these conditions progress, allowing for the development of different miRNA-based treatment strategies that target dysregulated mitochondrial-related genes, reestablishing their baseline activity and restricting further disease progression.",

    "title": "Epigenomic analysis identifies DTP subpopulation using HOPX to develop targeted therapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Genomic studies have identified oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, enabling effective targeted therapies. However, patients who initially respond inevitably experience regrowth. The drug-tolerant persister (DTP) stage is a key source of non-genetic resistance, yet its epigenetic regulation remains unclear. Using single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-seq), we identified two distinct DTP subpopulations in EGFR- and KRAS-inhibited models. The integrative network and pathway analysis revealed that one subpopulation is associated with cell cycle, while the other is enriched in developmental pathways. HOPX was the most enriched alveolar signature gene in the latter. It was transiently upregulated with cytoplasmic-to-nuclear\u00a0translocation, and its deletion significantly delayed DTP regrowth. Mechanistically, HOPX regulates NF-\u03baB activation and repressive histone modifications. Combining targeted therapy with NF-\u03baB or histone-methyltransferase inhibitors nearly abolished DTP regrowth. These findings highlight a potential anti-relapse strategy by targeting developmental pathways to modulate key lineage factors during lung regeneration in patients relapsing on targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) has long been known to be associated with early embryonic development and organogenesis, immune supervision, and tissue repair and homeostasis in adults. TGF-\u03b2 has complex roles in fibrosis and cancer that may be opposing at different stages of these diseases. Under pathological conditions, overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 causes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, deposition of extracellular matrix, and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to fibrotic disease or cancer. Fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and immune cells are the most common targets of TGF-\u03b2, while fibrosis and cancer are the most common TGF-\u03b2-associated diseases. Given the critical role of TGF-\u03b2 and its downstream molecules in fibrosis and progression of cancer, therapies targeting TGF-\u03b2 signaling appear to be a promising strategy. Preclinical and clinical studies have investigated therapies targeting TGF-\u03b2, including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, and ligand traps. However, development of targeted TGF-\u03b2 therapy has been hindered by systemic cytotoxicity. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and highlights targeted TGF-\u03b2 therapy for cancer and fibrosis as a therapeutic strategy for related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Tumor displays various forms of tumor heterogeneity including immune heterogeneity that allow cancer cells to survive during conventional anticancer drug interventions. Thus, there is a strong rationale for overcoming anticancer drug resistance by employing the components of immune cells. Using the immune system to target tumor cells has revolutionized treatment. Recently, significant progress has been achieved at preclinical and clinical levels to benefit cancer patients. A review of literature from the past ten years across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science focused on immunotherapy strategies. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), cancer vaccines, CAR T-cell therapy, and the role of the gut microbiome. While immunotherapy outcomes have improved, particularly for tumor types such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), challenges persist regarding predictive biomarker identification and better management. Ongoing research on modifiers of immune function like gut microbiome-derived metabolites, next-generation ADCs, and new classes of biologics is warranted. Overall, continued investigation toward optimizing synergistic immunotherapeutic combinations through strategic drug delivery systems is imperative for preclinical and clinical success in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Rotational error cannot be overlooked in single-isocenter multi-target (SIMT) stereotactic radiotherapy. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the treatment accuracy of linear accelerator-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) using SIMT non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with multiple brain metastases. We explored the impact of rotational error on planning target volume (PTV) margins, providing clinical evidence for the selection of appropriate PTV margin values. A total of 161 patients with multiple brain metastases (733 treatments; actual clinical PTV margins ranged from 1~2 mm) were included. Theoretical PTV margins were calculated based on the Van Herk and Jenghwa Chang formulas. We analyzed the influence of the distance from each target to the treatment isocenter, rotational errors, and PTV margin on treatment outcomes. Additionally, individualized PTV margins for each patient were calculated using the Jenghwa Chang formula and patients were divided into subgroups according to a 2-mm threshold for further analysis. The mean residual translational setup errors ranged from -0.04~0.01 mm, and rotational setup errors ranged from 0.15\u00b0~0.49\u00b0, both within acceptable limits. According to the Van Herk formula, required margins in posterior-anterior, superior-inferior, and right-left directions were 1.44 mm, 1.68 mm, and 1.78 mm, respectively. By incorporating both translational and rotational errors using the Jenghwa Chang formula, the comprehensive margin ranged from 1.69~1.79 mm (calculated based on the 95% confidence interval of distances from targets to isocenter). Additionally, when the mean distance from all targets to their respective treatment isocenters was 30.62 mm, the required margin calculated solely for translational errors using the Jenghwa Chang formula was 1.23 mm; if rotational errors were neglected, target coverage probability would decrease from 95% to 73%. Further subgroup analysis showed that 25 patients whose individualized theoretical margins exceeded 2 mm tended to experience worse outcomes compared to others, including intracranial local failure (ILF, defined as lesion progression within the previously irradiated intracranial region during follow-up; 32.00% vs. 22.29%,  This study confirms that the SIMT non-coplanar VMAT technique ensures treatment accuracy for FSRT in multiple brain metastases. Rotational errors reduce dose coverage, and a minimum safety margin of 1.79 mm is recommended to ensure tumor coverage and reduce local failure, providing a basis for future treatment optimization.",

    "abstract": "Cancer treatment currently includes a variety of approaches. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are combined based on cancer characteristics to develop personalized treatment plans. However, drug resistance can hinder the progress of treatment over time. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a metabolite with hormesis, exhibiting both pro-tumor and anti-tumor actions depending on its concentration during cancer progression. The MG-related metabolic pathway is being explored in the development of anti-cancer drugs, focusing on reducing MG stress or exploiting its cytotoxic effects to inhibit cancer progression. This article investigates the dual role of MG in cancer, emphasizing its effects on cell metabolism and tumor progression. It proposes MG capture therapy for the pre-cancerous stage and MG toxicity therapy for the cancer stage, contributing to the development of precise and individualized cancer treatments.",

    "title": "Single-cell combined transcriptome probes prognostic mechanisms of sialylation-related genes in cervical cancer.",
    "abstract": "Sialylation has been linked to cervical dysplasia, while its involvement in cervical cancer is uncertain. Hence , the aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model based on sialylation-related characteristics for cervical cancer patients and investigate how sialylation-related genes are altered in cervical cancer via analyses of transcriptome and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The current work incorporated 4 transcriptome datasets relevant to cervical cancer (including scRNA-seq) and 110 sialylation-related genes (SRGs). Initially, differentially expressed SRGs (DE-SRGs) were discovered by differential expression analysis, among other methods. Subsequently, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analysis was applied using DE-SRGs to detect prognostic genes and build prognostic models. Next, independent prognosis test was conducted, and a nomogram model was built using clinical characteristics and risk scores. Meanwhile, scRNA-seq was applied to examine the cellular composition and cell-to-cell regulation in cervical cancer vs normal group, and key cells were determined via prognostic genes and their differentiation process was investigated. Finally, the immunological microenvironment, mutant genes, and medication sensitivity were assessed. Clinical samples were taken to assess the expression of prognostic genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). First, we detected 19 DE-SRGs related with sialylation. Three prognostic genes, GALNT12, GCNT4, and NPL, were discovered by LASSO cox regression. A risk model constructed with prognostic genes revealed that patients in high-risk group had a much poorer survival rate than those in group with low risk. Meanwhile, low-risk cervical cancer patients were more likely to respond to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, depending on immunology, tumor microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. ScRNA-seq data suggests that the expression of prognostic genes was higher in key cells, macrophages and fibroblasts, and played a more critical role in cervical cancer. The findings from qRT-PCR demonstrated that GCNT4 and NPL were considerably overexpressed in the cervical cancer group. In this research, GALNT12, GCNT4 and NPL were discovered as sialylation-related prognostic genes in cervical cancer, providing novel pathways for detection and treatment.",
