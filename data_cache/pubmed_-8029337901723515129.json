    "title": "Circular RNA, A Molecule with Potential Chemistry and Applications in RNA-based Cancer Therapeutics: An Insight into Recent Advances.",
    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that do not code for proteins. Among these, circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a recently identified class of endogenous ncRNAs with a pivotal role in gene regulation, alongside short ncRNAs (e.g., microRNAs or miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). CircRNAs are characterized by their single-stranded, covalently closed circular structure, which lacks polyadenylated tails and 5'-3' ends. This unique circular conformation makes them resistant to exonuclease degradation, rendering them more stable than linear RNAs, such as mRNAs in human blood cells, which highlights their potential as biomarkers. Both linear and circular RNAs are derived from pre-mRNA precursors. However, while linear RNAs are produced through conventional splicing, circRNAs are primarily formed through a process known as reverse splicing. CircRNAs can be categorized into five basic types: exon circRNAs, circular intronic RNAs, exon-intron circRNAs, intergenic circRNAs, and fusion circRNAs. These molecules have been shown to significantly influence key hallmarks of cancer, including sustained growth signaling, proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, unlimited replicative potential, and metastasis. This article will delve into the biogenesis and functions of circRNAs, explore their roles in cancer, and discuss their potential applications as therapeutic options and diagnostic biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading health issue and treatments to eradicate it, such as conventional chemotherapy, are non\u2011selective and come with a number of complications. The present review focuses on the relatively new area of precision oncolytic viral therapy (OVT), with genetic targeting and immune modifications that offer a new future for CRC treatment. In the present review, an overview of the selection factors that are considered optimal for an oncolytic virus, mechanisms of oncolysis and immunomodulation applied to the OVT, as well as new strategies to improve the efficacy of this method are described. Additionally, cause\u2011and\u2011effect relationships are examined for OVT efficacy, mediated by the tumor microenvironment, and directions for genetic manipulation of viral specificity are explored. The possibility of synergy between OVT and immune checkpoint inhibitors and other treatment approaches are demonstrated. Incorporating the details of the present review, biomarker\u2011guided combination therapies in precision OVT for individualized CRC care, significant issues and future trends in this required area of medicine are highlighted. Increasingly, OVT is leaving the experimental stage and may become routine practice; it provides a new perspective on overcoming CRC and highlights the importance of further research and clinical work.",

    "abstract": "Cancer originates from dysregulated cell proliferation driven by driver gene mutations. Despite numerous algorithms developed to identify genomic mutational signatures, they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited clinical applicability. Here, we presented ProgModule, an advanced computational framework designed to identify mutation driver modules for cancer prognosis and immunotherapy response prediction. In ProgModule, we introduced the Prognosis-Related Mutually Exclusive Mutation (PRMEM) score, which optimizes the balance between exclusive mutation coverage and the incorporation of mutation combination mechanisms critical for cancer prognosis. Applying to BLCA and HNSC cohorts, ProgModule successfully identified driver modules that stratify patients into distinct prognostic subgroups, and the combination of these modules could serve as an effective prognostic biomarker. Extending our method to diverse cancers, ProgModule presented robust prognostic performance and stability across model parameters, including stopping criteria and network topology. Moreover, our analysis suggested that driver modules can predict immunotherapeutic benefit more effectively than existing signatures. Further analyses based on published CRISPR data indicated that genes within these modules may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Altogether, ProgModule emerges as a powerful tool for identifying mutation driver modules as prognostic and immunotherapy response biomarkers, and genes within these modules may be used as potential therapeutic targets for cancer, offering new insights into precision oncology.",

Characterization of the diverse malignant and immunology cellular states that make up the TME and their associations with clinical outcomes are critical for cancer therapy. However, we are still lack of knowledge about the cellular states and their clinical relevance in OV. We manually collected the comprehensive transcriptomes of OV samples and characterized the cellular states and ecotypes based on a machine-learning framework. The robustness of the cellular states was validated in independent cohorts and single-cell transcriptomes. The functions and regulators of cellular states were investigated. Meanwhile, we thoroughly examined the associations between cellular states and various clinical factors, including clinical prognosis and drug responses. We depicted and characterized an immunophenotypic landscape of 3,099 OV samples and 80,044 cells based on a machine learning framework. We identified and validated 32 distinct transcriptionally defined cellular states from 12 cell types and three cellular communities or ecotypes, extending the current immunological subtypes in OV. Functional enrichment and upstream transcriptional regulator analyses revealed cancer hallmark-related pathways and potential immunological biomarkers. We further investigated the spatial patterns of identified cellular states by integrating the spatially resolved transcriptomes. Moreover, prognostic landscape and drug sensitivity analysis exhibited clinically relevant immunological subtypes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Our comprehensive analysis of TME helps leveraging various immunological subtypes to highlight new directions and targets for the treatment of cancer.",

This classification system could be used as an extension of the traditional CMS classification system for CRC to guide more accurate classification and treatment.We also screened CAF-derived THBS2 as a potential biomarker for CM and found that it plays an important role in CRC disease models in vitro and in vivo, promoting tumor development and metastasis as well as TAM recruitment. Targeting THBS2 combined with PD-1 therapy effectively improved the therapeutic effect of immunotherapy in vivo. The CM classification provides a new perspective for CRC treatment, and THBS2, which is highly expressed in CM cases, can be used as a new potential combined target for immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Overcoming barriers to advanced biomolecular technologies that inform treatment of solid tumors: a roadmap to access.",
    "abstract": "The advent of advanced biomolecular technologies for detecting molecular and genomic signatures of individual tumors has transformed oncology care, introducing proven methodologies that can inform treatment with matched targeted therapies and predict response at the individual patient level. However, access to these technologies has been hampered by multiple barriers, most notably price and obtainability. Other barriers include lack of knowledge of available technologies, concerns about value, and outdated infrastructures that impede critical operations within the clinic or laboratory. Accessibility barriers to advanced biomolecular testing are critically important to patient care, as new technological advances in molecular medicine continue to outpace the implementation of solutions. Given the proven evidence for improved patient outcomes with precision oncology medicines, it is imperative to understand the value afforded by these technologies. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe existing and emerging barriers to access and present a \"roadmap to access\" that will facilitate the urgently needed discussions to identify solutions for improving access. Implementation of these solutions will raise awareness of available technologies and treatments and their prognostic significance, improve evidence collection for demonstration of value, and fortify clinical and laboratory infrastructure and operations. New molecular technologies in medicine have made it possible to match oncology drugs to molecular markers found on individual tumors, such that patients can received more personalized treatments that specifically target their tumors. However, these technologies are often underused because of their high prices and challenges with obtaining them. Other concerns that have restricted their use include the lack of understanding about what they do or what benefits they offer, the logistics of introducing these technologies to clinics or labs, and questions about direct and indirect costs of their use versus potential cost-savings from selecting the best available treatment. Here we describe the current barriers that prevent patients and their healthcare providers from using these new technologies. We propose a \u201croadmap to access\u201d to describe solutions which will enable access to these technologies. These solutions will benefit the healthcare community by improving the awareness of available technologies and understanding of how they improve health outcomes, demonstrate their value, and improve operations within clinics and laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis and pyroptosis, two forms of cell death, are increasingly reported for their pivotal roles in cancer biology. However, the understanding of the combined ferroptosis-pyroptosis (FPtosis)-related gene signature in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the FPtosis-related signature in CRC. Data integration from both the training and validation cohorts was performed. The FPtosis-related signature was established. We evaluated the prognostic significance of the signature through Kaplan-Meier analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Functional analyses were conducted to explore the underlying biological mechanisms. Additionally, we analyzed the correlations between the FPtosis-related signature, immune infiltration, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. The FPtosis-related signature demonstrated significant prognostic potential and can serve as an independent biomarker for predicting outcomes. The signature showed correlations with advanced tumor stage, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Subgroup analyses revealed the valuable predictive role of the FPtosis-related signature in predicting survival across different clinical subgroups, including age, gender, tumor stage, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis status, and distant metastasis status. Moreover, the signature exhibited positive associations with inflammation and the infiltration of diverse immune cells, such as neutrophils, M0 and M2 macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). In microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC, the expression of most ICB genes was higher in the high-FPtosis group compared to the low-FPtosis group. The FPtosis signature can effectively predict the prognosis of CRC and had the potential to improve the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a major clinical challenge, particularly for refractory patients who have exhausted standard treatments. Fruquintinib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor that has been approved by FDA for adult patients with mCRC who received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy, and an epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapy if RAS wild type. Despite advances in mCRC treatment, patients who progress after standard therapies face limited options. The efficacy of treatments tends to diminish and side effects can be intolerable. There is a need for therapies that can extend survival without worsening quality of life. In the pivotal FRESCO-2 phase 3 trial, 691 patients with heavily pretreated mCRC were studied. Fruquintinib was found to significantly improve survival times, with a median overall survival (OS) of 7.4 months compared with 4.8 months with a placebo. Progression-free survival (PFS) also showed significant improvement with fruquintinib of 3.7 months versus 1.8 months in the placebo group. This was the first trial to show that an oral VEGFR inhibitor can be effective in refractory patients. Fruquintinib represents a new treatment option for patients with mCRC who have limited therapeutic options. Fruquintinib has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS, in heavily pretreated patients. The FRESCO-2 trial demonstrated its efficacy, even in patients previously treated with trifluridine-tipiracil or regorafenib, showing a 34% reduction in OS and improved PFS. Fruquintinib, approved by FDA for heavily pretreated patients with mCRC, addresses an unmet need in this population. Future research should focus on optimizing its integration into treatment plans and identifying biomarkers for personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been used to treat gastric cancer, and PD-L1 expression has been identified as a biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, PD-L1 expression prediction for immunotherapy response is inaccurate, and improved response biomarkers are required. Thus, it is important to identify additional biomarkers that can predict the responses to PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in gastric cancer. In this study, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of 142 DEGs co-expressed with PD-L1 were performed, and 41 genes were identified based on the intersection of the mRNA-significant GO term network and the mRNA-significant signalling pathway network. Further intersection analysis of the 41 candidate genes and 137 positive immunotherapy response genes indicated that BATF2 significantly affects the overall survival of GC patients. The transcription factor prediction for BATF2 identified additional potential predictors and therapeutic targets for GC. STAT and IRF family members were predicted to be transcription factors for BATF2. In addition, BATF2 knockdown significantly promoted GC cell growth, and PD-L1 expression was upregulated in si-BATF2-treated MKN-45 cells. Thus, BATF2 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade therapy in GC. BATF2 acts as a tumour suppressor gene during the development of GC. BATF2 is closely related to PD-L1 expression in GC, and high BATF2 expression positively correlates with low PD-L1 expression. BATF2 can be used as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for responding to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies in GC.",

With the successful application of perioperative immunotherapy, understanding PD-L1-associated clinical and molecular characteristics in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is essential. We analyzed 3185 NSCLC patients undergoing targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations between PD-L1 expression and molecular profiles were compared across early- (I-III) and advanced-stage (IV) cohorts. In early-stage NSCLC (n\u2009=\u2009974), high PD-L1 expression was less common than in advanced-stage patients (lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD]: 7.52% vs. 15.98%, p\u2009<\u20090.001; lung squamous cell carcinoma [LUSC]: 18.33% vs. 20.84%, p\u2009=\u20090.058). For LUAD, high PD-L1 expression was more frequent in older patients, males and smokers. Additionally, LUSC overall showed a higher rate of high PD-L1 expression than LUAD. In LUAD, early-stage patients had a lower proportion of tumor mutation burden-high (TMB-H) compared to advanced-stage patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but no significant difference was observed in LUSC (p\u2009=\u20090.597).

    "abstract": "Two thirds of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients have localized disease at diagnosis. A significant proportion of these patients will relapse. There is a need for prognostic biomarkers to improve risk-stratification and specific treatments for patients that relapse. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical utility of microRNA signatures as prognostic biomarkers in localized clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and propose new therapeutic targets in patients with a high-risk of relapse. The microRNA profiles from a discovery cohort of 71 T1-T2 ccRCC patients (n\u2009=\u200988) were analyzed using microarrays. MicroRNAs prognostic value was established, and a microRNAs signature predicting relapse for T1b-T3 disease was defined. Independent validation was carried out by qPCR in cohorts from UK (n\u2009=\u200975) and Spain (n\u2009=\u2009180), and the TCGA cohort (n\u2009=\u2009175). In the Spanish validation cohort, proteomics experiments were done. Proteins were extracted from FFPE tissue and analyzed using by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Additionally, ccRCC TCGA RNA-seq data was also analyzed. Both protein and RNA-seq data was analyzed using Significance Analysis of Micorarrays (SAM) and probabilistic graphical models, which allow the identification of relevant biological processes between low and high-risk tumors. A 9-microRNAs signature, Bio-miR, classified patients into low- and high-risk with disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years of 87.12 vs. 54.17% respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.0086, HR\u2009=\u20093.58, 95%CI: 1.37-8.3). Results were confirmed in the validation cohorts with 5-year DFS rates of 94% vs. 62% in the UK cohort (HR\u2009=\u20097.14, p\u2009=\u20090.001), 82.9% vs. 58.7% in the Spanish cohort (HR\u2009=\u20092.46, p\u2009=\u20090.0013), and 5-year overall survival rates of 72.7% vs. 44.5% in the TCGA cohort (HR\u2009=\u20092.43, p\u2009=\u20090.0012). Among low-risk patients according to adjuvant immunotherapy clinical trial criteria, Bio-miR identified a high-risk group. Maybe those patients ought to be considered to receive adjuvant therapy. Proteins overexpressed in the high-risk group were mainly related to focal adhesion, serine and inositol metabolism, and angiogenesis. Probabilistic graphical models defined eight functional nodes related to specific biological processes. Differences between low- and high-risk tumors were detected in complement activation and translation functional nodes. In ccRCC TCGA cohort, 676 genes were differentially expressed between low and high-risk patients, mainly related to complement activation, adhesion, and chemokine and cytokine cascades. In this case, probabilistic graphical models defined ten functional nodes. Calcium binding, membrane, adhesion, extracellular matrix, blood microparticle, inflammatory response and immune response had higher functional node activity, and metabolism node, containing genes related to retinol and xenobiotic and CYP450 metabolism, had lower activity in the high-risk group. Bio-miR dichotomizes ccRCC patients with non-metastatic disease into those with low- and high-risk of relapse. This has implications for treatment and follow-up, identifying patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment in clinical trials, preventing unnecessary exposure to side-effects, and providing health economics benefits. Additionally, promising therapeutic targets, as angiogenesis, immune response, metabolism, or complement activation, were found deregulated in high-risk ccRCC patients defined by Bio-miR. These findings may be useful to select patients for tailored, molecularly-driven clinical trials. Identifying which patients with kidney cancer are most at risk of their cancer coming back after surgery is critical, so that they can be prioritized for early treatment. We have identified a combination of biomarkers present in the cancer tissue (called BiomiR) which can help to do this.",

    "title": "Checkpoint Inhibitors, CAR T Cells, and the Hemostatic System: What Do We Know So Far?",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are novel therapeutic strategies that enhance anticancer immunity by activating or engineering cancer-targeting T cells. The resulting hyperinflammation carries several side effects, ranging from autoimmune-like symptoms to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with potentially severe consequences. Recent findings indicate that ICIs increase the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic adverse events. Patients with prior VTE might be at higher risk of developing new events under ICI while other risk factors vary across studies. So far, data on CAR T-linked coagulopathies are limited. Hypofibrinogenemia in the presence of CRS is the most commonly observed dysregulation of hemostatic parameters. A rare but particularly severe adverse event is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation activation, which can occur in the setting of CRS and may be linked to immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. While the increasing number of studies on thromboembolic complications and coagulation alterations under ICIs and CAR T therapies are concerning, these results might be influenced by the retrospective study design and the heterogeneous patient populations. Importantly, numerous promising new T cell-based immunotherapies are currently under investigation for various cancers and are expected to become very prominent therapy options in the near future. Therefore, coagulopathies and thrombosis under T cell-directed immuno- and anti-cancer therapies is important. Our review provides an overview of the current understanding of ICI- and CAR T-associated thromboembolism. We discuss pathogenic mechanisms of inflammation-associated coagulation activation and explore potential biomarkers for VTE.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 have transformed the treatment of B-cell cancers, but many patients do not have long-term remission. We designed an anti-CD19 enhanced (armored) CAR T-cell product (huCART19-IL18) that secretes interleukin-18 to enhance antitumor activity. In this study, we assessed the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of huCART19-IL18 in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma after previous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Using a 3-day manufacturing process, we administered huCART19-IL18-positive cells in doses ranging from 3\u00d710 A total of 21 patients received huCART19-IL18. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 62% of the patients (47% with grade 1 or 2), and immune effector-cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 14% (all grade 1 or 2). No unexpected adverse events were observed. Robust CAR T-cell expansion was detected across all dose levels. At 3 months after infusion, a complete or partial response was seen in 81% of the patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 62 to 93) and a complete response in 52% (90% CI, 33 to 71). With a median follow-up of 17.5 months (range, 3 to 34), the median duration of response was 9.6 months (90% CI, 5.5 to not reached). In this small study, huCART19-IL18 had a safety profile consistent with other CAR T-cell treatments and showed promising efficacy at low cell doses in patients with lymphoma after the failure of previous anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis, underscoring the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the role of C16orf74 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in HNSC. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that C16orf74 is significantly overexpressed in HNSC and is associated with advanced disease stages, therapy resistance, and shorter overall and progression-free survival. A prognostic nomogram integrating C16orf74 expression with clinicopathological features demonstrated robust predictive performance. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses suggest that high C16orf74 expression might contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing key immune cell populations, such as B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells, which are critical for anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, C16orf74 expression was inversely associated with immune checkpoint expression and immunotherapy response, highlighting its potential as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy. Drug sensitivity analyses identified potential therapeutic agents, including arsenic trioxide, carmustine, vincristine, quercetin, and carboplatin for patients with high C16orf74 expression. These findings highlight the potential of C16orf74 as a biomarker and therapeutic target to improve HNSC management.",

    "title": "Advancing Breast Cancer Treatment: The Role of Immunotherapy and Cancer Vaccines in Overcoming Therapeutic Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health challenge due to its complex biology, which complicates both diagnosis and treatment. Immunotherapy and cancer vaccines have emerged as promising alternatives, harnessing the body's immune system to precisely target and eliminate cancer cells. However, several key factors influence the selection and effectiveness of these therapies, including BC subtype, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PD-L1 expression, HER2 resistance, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). BC subtypes play a critical role in shaping treatment responses. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits the highest sensitivity to immunotherapy, while HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtypes often require combination strategies for optimal outcomes. High TMB enhances immune responses by generating neoantigens, making tumors more susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs); whereas, low TMB may indicate resistance. Similarly, elevated TIL levels are associated with better immunotherapy efficacy, while PD-L1 expression serves as a key predictor of checkpoint inhibitor success. Meanwhile, HER2 resistance and an immunosuppressive TME contribute to immune evasion, highlighting the need for multi-faceted treatment approaches. Current breast cancer immunotherapies encompass a range of targeted treatments. HER2-directed therapies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, block HER2 dimerization and enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), while small-molecule inhibitors, like lapatinib and tucatinib, suppress HER2 signaling to curb tumor growth. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) improve tumor targeting by coupling monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic agents, minimizing off-target effects. Meanwhile, ICIs, including pembrolizumab, restore T-cell function, and CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy leverages macrophages to reshape the TME and overcome immunotherapy resistance. While immunotherapy, particularly in TNBC, has demonstrated promise by eliciting durable immune responses, its efficacy varies across subtypes. Challenges such as immune-related adverse events, resistance mechanisms, high costs, and delayed responses remain barriers to widespread success. Breast cancer vaccines-including protein-based, whole-cell, mRNA, dendritic cell, and epitope-based vaccines-aim to stimulate tumor-specific immunity. Though clinical success has been limited, ongoing research is refining vaccine formulations, integrating combination therapies, and identifying biomarkers for improved patient stratification. Future advancements in BC treatment will depend on optimizing immunotherapy through biomarker-driven approaches, addressing tumor heterogeneity, and developing innovative combination therapies to overcome resistance. By leveraging these strategies, researchers aim to enhance treatment efficacy and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) act as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity by presenting antigens to effector immune cells and have shown broad application potential in tumor immunotherapy. However, the clinical translation of DC vaccines encounters significant challenges, such as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the sub-optimal DC function and vaccine efficacy in vivo. In this review, our investigation has uncovered the latest developments in DC vaccines and their potential in cancer immunotherapy, with a special emphasis on the integration of nanotechnology. Several types of nanomaterials, including protein cage nanoparticles (NPs), biomimetic NPs, and targeted multifunctional NPs, have been developed to enhance the antigen presentation ability of DCs and their stimulatory effects on T cells. In addition, we have also summarized the synergistic anti-cancer effects of DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In addition, recent advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to develop novel biomarkers that can enhance the antigen presentation capacity of DCs and stimulate T cells. These biomarkers not only improve the accuracy and precision of DC vaccine design but also provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms of the DC-mediated immune response. Despite challenges pertaining to technical complexities and individual adaptation in the design and production of DC vaccines, personalized immunotherapy based on DCs is expected to become an important part of cancer treatment with rapid developments in biotechnology and immunology. This review provides new perspectives and potential solutions for the optimal design and application of DC vaccines in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become a prominent strategy for cancer treatment over the past ten years. However, the efficacy of ICIs remains limited, with certain cancers exhibiting resistance to these therapeutic approaches. Consequently, several immune checkpoint proteins are presently being thoroughly screened and assessed in both preclinical and clinical studies. Among these candidates, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) is considered a promising target. TIM-3 exhibits multiple immunosuppressive effects on various types of immune cells. Given its differential expression levels at distinct stages of T cell dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME), TIM-3, along with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), serves as indicators of T cell exhaustion. Moreover, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the impact of TIM-3 and PD-1 expression in cancer cells on the efficacy of immunotherapy. To increase the effectiveness of anti-TIM-3 and anti-PD-1 therapies, it is proposed to combine the inhibition of TIM-3, PD-1, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The efficacy of TIM-3 inhibition in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is being evaluated in a number of ongoing clinical trials for patients with various cancers.\u00a0This study systematically investigates the fundamental biology of TIM-3 and PD-1, as well as the detailed mechanisms through which TIM-3 and PD-1/PD-L1 axis contribute to cancer immune evasion. Additionally, this article provides a thorough analysis of ongoing clinical trials evaluating the synergistic effects of combining PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 inhibitors in anti-cancer treatment, along with an overview of the current status of TIM-3 and PD-1 antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The approval of immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, sorafenib remains a first-line therapeutic option for advanced patients and, in particular, for patients not eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitors, but its efficacy is limited by the onset of acquired resistance, highlighting the urgent need for predictive biomarkers. This study investigates the role of miR-22 in metabolic reprogramming and its potential as a biomarker in HCC. The analysis of miR-22 expression was performed in HCC patients and preclinical models by qPCR. Functional analyses in HCC cells evaluated GLUT1 as a direct miR-22 target. Cellular and metabolic assays evaluated the miR-22/GLUT1 axis's role in metabolic changes, tumor aggressiveness, and sorafenib response. Circulating miR-22 was analyzed in sorafenib-treated HCC patients and rats. MiR-22 was downregulated in HCCs and associated with aggressive tumor features. Functionally, miR-22 modulated the HIF1A pathway, enhanced survival in stressful conditions, promoted a glycolytic shift, and enhanced cancer cell plasticity and sorafenib resistance via GLUT1 targeting. In addition, high serum miR-22 levels were associated with sorafenib resistance in HCC patients and rats. GLUT1 inhibition sensitized low miR-22-expressing HCC cells to sorafenib in preclinical models. These findings suggest that circulating miR-22 deserves attention as a predictive biomarker of sorafenib response. GLUT1 inhibition may represent a therapeutic strategy to combine with sorafenib, particularly in patients exhibiting high circulating miR-22 levels.",

The immunohistochemical expression of IDO1 and IL4I1 was evaluated by an experienced head and neck pathologist in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 402 patients with HNSCC. Clinical and pathological data were retrieved, and the overall survival of the patients was calculated. In this study, IDO1 and IL4I1 were expressed by HNSCC tumor cells in the TMA of 402 patients.

However, the prediction of relapse and therapeutic response in LUAD patients with stage I based on the signature of autophagy remains unclear. Gene expression data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Autophagy-associated genes were extracted from the Human Autophagy Moderator Database. The autophagy score was established by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Real-time PCR was used to detect gene expression of hub genes in LUAD patients. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) was analyzed to identify crucial genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to reveal the molecular features of patients. ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to estimate the tumor immune infiltration. TIDE score and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database were used to assess therapeutic response. We established an autophagy score based on 19 autophagy genes. Among these genes, MAP1LC3B played a crucial role in PPI network and was down-regulated in tumor tissues both in TCGA and local cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the risk model effectively predict RFS of stage I LUAD (area under the curve (AUC) at 1, 2, 3 years = 0.701, 0.836, and 0.818, respectively).

    "title": "The role of macrophage polarization in ovarian cancer: from molecular mechanism to therapeutic potentials.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy, primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis, frequent recurrence, and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. A critical factor contributing to OC's aggressiveness is the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the presence and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs, often skewed toward an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, facilitate tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This comprehensive review delves into the multifaceted regulation of macrophage polarization in OC, highlighting key molecular pathways such as PTEN loss, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, NF-\u03baB, Myc, STAT3, and JNK, among others. Additionally, it explores the role of chemokines, non-coding RNAs, and various proteins in modulating TAM phenotypes. Emerging evidence underscores the significance of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) in promoting M2 polarization, thereby enhancing tumor progression and therapy resistance. The review also identifies critical biomarkers associated with macrophage polarization, including CD163, LILRB1, MUC2, and others, which hold prognostic and therapeutic potential. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs are extensively discussed, encompassing oncolytic viruses, engineered EVs, immunotherapies, nanoparticles, targeted therapies, and natural products. These approaches aim to reprogram TAMs from a pro-tumorigenic M2 state to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype, thereby enhancing immune responses and overcoming resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, the review addresses the interplay between macrophage polarization and therapy resistance, emphasizing the need for novel interventions to modulate the TME effectively. By synthesizing current knowledge on macrophage polarization in ovarian cancer, this study underscores the potential of targeting TAMs to improve clinical outcomes and personalize treatment strategies for OC patients. Continued research in this domain is essential to develop robust therapeutic frameworks that can mitigate the immunosuppressive TME and enhance the efficacy of existing and novel cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify and analyze immunogenic cell death (ICD)-related multi-omics features in bladder cancer (BLCA) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data. By integrating these datasets, we sought to construct a prognostic signature (ICDRS) and explore its clinical and biological implications, including its association with immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity. Publicly available datasets from TCGA and GEO, including scRNA-seq (GSE222315, 9 samples) and bulk RNA-seq (TCGA-BLCA, 403 samples; GSE13507, 160 samples), were analyzed. Single-cell data were processed using Seurat, and ICD scores were calculated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified ICD-related modules, and machine learning algorithms (Lasso, Ridge, CoxBoost) were employed to construct the ICDRS. Survival analysis, immune infiltration, pathway enrichment, and drug sensitivity were evaluated to validate the model. The ICDRS, based on eight key genes (IL32, AHNAK, ANXA5, FN1, GSN, CNN3, FXYD3, CTSS), effectively stratified BLCA patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant differences in overall survival (OS, P < 0.001). High ICDRS scores were associated with immune-suppressive TME, including increased infiltration of T cells CD4 memory resting (P = 0.02) and macrophages M0/M1/M2 (P = 0.01). Pathway enrichment revealed correlations with cholesterol homeostasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and KRAS signaling. Drug sensitivity analysis showed high-risk groups were resistant to Cisplatin (P = 0.003), Mitomycin C (P = 0.01), and Paclitaxel (P = 0.004), with IC50 values significantly higher than low-risk groups. The ICDRS serves as a robust prognostic biomarker for BLCA, offering insights into tumor immune evasion mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Its integration with clinical features enhances personalized treatment strategies, highlighting the importance of ICD in BLCA immunotherapy and precision medicine. The model's predictive accuracy and biological relevance were validated across multiple datasets, underscoring its potential for clinical application.",

This investigator-initiated, phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial enrolled patients with unresectable MPNSTs. Patients were treated with pexidartinib 1000 mg and sirolimus 2 mg orally daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, safety profile, and overall survival (OS). Pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiplex immunofluorescence and differential transcriptional profiling. Fifteen patients with MPNSTs were enrolled and 14 initiated therapy. Eight had neurofibromatosis type 1, five were sporadic, and one was undetermined. Although the target sample size was 25, because of the lower-than-expected accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment was halted on April 12, 2023.

    "abstract": "Deep insights into the metabolic remodelling effects on the immune microenvironment of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are crucial for advancing precision immunotherapies and targeted therapies. This study aimed to provide novel insights into the molecular landscape of ESCC and identify clinically actionable targets associated with immunosuppression driven by metabolic changes. We performed metabolomic and proteomic analyses combined with previous genomic and transcriptomic data, identified multi-omics-linked molecular features, and constructed metabolic-immune interaction-based ESCC classifiers in a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort. We further verified the molecular characteristics and related mechanisms of ESCC subtypes. Our integrated multi-omics analysis revealed dysregulated proteins and metabolic imbalances characterizing ESCC, with significant alterations in metabolites and proteins linked to genetic traits. Importantly, ESCC patients were stratified into three subtypes (S1, S2, and S3) on the basis of integrated metabolomic and proteomic data. A robust subtype prediction model was developed and validated across two independent cohorts. Notably, patients classified under the poorest prognosis subtype (S3 subtype) exhibited a significant immunosuppressive microenvironment. We identified key metabolism-related biomarkers for the S3 subtype, specifically creatine and hexokinase 3 (HK3). Creatine accumulation and HK3 protein deficiency synergistically reprogrammed macrophage metabolism, driving M2-like TAM polarization. This metabolic shift fostered an immunosuppressive microenvironment that accelerated tumour progression. These results highlight the potential of targeting creatine metabolism to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for ESCC. Our analysis reveals molecular variation in multi-omics linkages and identifies targets that reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment through metabolic remodelling improving immunotherapy and targeted therapy for ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have emerged as promising treatments for advanced NSCLC patients without actionable mutations. However, predicting treatment response remains challenging, especially in second-line settings. Although PD-L1 is the only validated biomarker, additional prognostic tools are needed. Systemic inflammation markers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) show potential but remain underused. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), linked to immunotherapy resistance, are associated with increased splenic volume. Therefore this study introduces a splenic index score, combining pre-immunotherapy splenic volume and NLR, to evaluate its prognostic value in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab in the second-line setting. We analyzed 50 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received nivolumab as second-line or later therapy. Baseline splenic volume and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were assessed using imaging and laboratory data prior to nivolumab initiation. The Splenic Index Score for each patient was calculated using the formula: (baseline splenic volume) \u00d7 (NLR). Additionally, we evaluated the impact of other factors, including body mass index (BMI), tumor PD-L1 expression, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and sites of metastasis. The median Splenic Index score was 877.3 (range: 180-4830). A higher Splenic Index score was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). Specifically, patients with a high Splenic Index score had a median PFS of 3 months, compared to 8 months in those with a low Splenic Index score (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1-3.7, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Similarly, the median OS was 4 months for patients with a high Splenic Index score, while it was 15 months for those with a low score (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.3, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Baseline splenic volume, basal NLR, and tumor PD-L1 expression were also evaluated; however, no significant differences in PFS or OS were observed for these parameters. Our study demonstrates that the splenic index score, derived from combining radiological and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, serves as a predictive tool for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic NSCLC patients receiving second-line nivolumab therapy.",

    "title": "Why combine and why neoadjuvant? Tumor immunological perspectives on chemoimmunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype characterized by limited targeted therapies and high recurrence rates. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise, their efficacy as monotherapy is limited. Clinically, ICIs demonstrate significant benefit primarily when combined with chemotherapy, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting for early-stage TNBC, which yields superior outcomes compared to adjuvant therapy. This review elucidates the tumor immunological principles underlying these observations. We discussed how the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), progressive T cell exhaustion, and associated epigenetic scarring constrain ICI monotherapy effectiveness. Crucially, we highlight the immunological advantages of the neoadjuvant approach: the presence of the primary tumor provides abundant antigens, and intact tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) act as critical sites for ICI-mediated priming and expansion of na\u00efve and precursor exhausted T cells. This robust activation within TDLNs enhances systemic anti-tumor immunity and expands the T cell repertoire, a process less effectively achieved in the adjuvant setting after tumor resection. These mechanisms provide a strong rationale for the improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival observed with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, as demonstrated in trials like KEYNOTE-522. We further explore the implications for adjuvant therapy decisions based on treatment response, the challenges of ICI resistance, the need for predictive biomarkers, management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and future therapeutic directions. Understanding the dynamic interplay between chemotherapy, ICIs, T cells, and the TME, particularly the role of TDLNs in the neoadjuvant context, is essential for optimizing immunotherapy strategies and improving outcomes for patients with TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have become the standard first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations, offering significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent studies suggest that their effectiveness decreased with the emergence of acquired resistance, such as C797S and T790M. Immunotherapy alone also shows enhanced PFS and OS over chemotherapy; however, its applicability can be limited in cases with low programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and result in immune-related adverse effects like those observed in retrospective, non-randomized studies. Emerging fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs, currently under clinical trials, show promising potential to address these resistance mechanisms. Advanced inhibitors, including BBT-176, BLU-945, and BLU-701, have effectively targeted resistant mutations and reduced disease progression. Studies have suggested that combining fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs with immunotherapies targeting novel pathways like LAG-3 and TIM-3 may enhance patient outcomes. Such combination regimens aim to optimize PFS, OS, and ORR while minimizing adverse effects and addressing the limitations of current therapies. This study explores the landscape of EGFR mutations, their clinical significance, and the integration of innovative fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs with immunotherapies, emphasizing the potential of precision medicine in advancing the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), accounting for about 10%-20% of all breast cancer cases, is characterized by its aggressive nature, high recurrence rates, and poor prognosis. Unlike other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC lacks hormone receptors and specific molecular targets, limiting therapeutic options. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in treating TNBC by targeting immune evasion mechanisms. Despite these advancements, several issues remain unresolved, including low response rates in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) negative TNBC subtypes and the challenge of predicting which patients will benefit from ICIs. Consequently, there is growing interest in identifying reliable biomarkers beyond PD-L1 expression. This review synthesizes recent studies to provide a comprehensive perspective on ICI therapy in TNBC, clarifying the status of single-agent ICI therapies and combination strategies, emphasizing the need for further research into biomarkers. These insights provide clues for more personalized and effective treatment approaches, ultimately aiming to improve clinical outcomes for patients with TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD1, revolutionized melanoma treatment. However, resistance and low response rates remain problems. Our goal was to pinpoint actionable biomarkers of resistance to anti-PD1 treatment and verify therapeutic effectiveness in vivo. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and survival analysis in a database of 1434 samples, we identified the strongest resistance-associated genes. Inhibitors were evaluated in C57BL/6J mice using wild-type B16-F10, and BRAF, -PTEN, -CDKN2A-mutant YUMM1.7 melanoma cell lines. We investigated the synergistic impact of anti-PD1 therapy and yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) inhibition by non-photoactivated Verteporfin. Tumour volume was determined at fixed cutoff points, normalized to body weights. In the anti-PD1-treated melanoma cohort, YAP1 was the strongest druggable candidate overexpressed in non-responder patients (ROC AUC\u2009=\u20090.699, FC\u2009=\u20091.8, P=1.1E-8). The baseline YAP1 expression correlated with worse progression-free survival (HR\u2009=\u20092.51, P=1.2E-6, FDR\u2009=\u20091%), and overall survival (HR\u2009=\u20092.15, P\u2009=\u20091.2E-5, FDR\u2009=\u20091%). In YUMM1.7, combination of Verteporfin plus anti-PD1 reduced tumour size more than anti-PD1 monotherapy (P=0.008), or control (P=0.021). There was no difference between the cohorts in B16-F10 inoculated mice. We found increased expression of YAP1 in YUMM1.7 mice compared to B16-F10. The combination therapy induced a more-immune-inflamed phenotype characterized by increased expression of T cell and M1 macrophage markers. Verteporfin with anti-PD1 exhibited antitumor potential by promoting a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment in melanoma. We believe that YAP1 acts as a master regulator of anti-PD1 resistance.",

    "abstract": "A clinically important subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is driven by common mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Over the past decade, first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have substantially improved clinical outcomes, although acquired resistance inevitably emerges. In particular, the third-generation TKI osimertinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to earlier-generation TKIs in the frontline setting, yet median OS remains approximately three years in pivotal trials. Efforts to extend disease control have led to various upfront intensification strategies, including combining EGFR TKIs with antiangiogenics or chemotherapy (e.g., the FLAURA-2 trial), and pairing novel bispecific antibodies such as amivantamab with third-generation TKIs. Upon progression on third-generation EGFR TKIs, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard second-line treatment, albeit with modest response rates. Emerging therapies targeting MET amplification (e.g., savolitinib plus osimertinib), leveraging antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., patritumab deruxtecan), or adding immunotherapy and antiangiogenics have shown preliminary promise in overcoming resistance. Ongoing trials are assessing optimal treatment sequencing and the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide therapy escalation or de-escalation. Ultimately, the evolving landscape of EGFR-mutant NSCLC underscores the need for refined biomarker-driven approaches and personalized regimens to achieve further gains in survival. In this review, we discuss these strategies in detail, highlighting current evidence and future directions for EGFR-mutant NSCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Penile cancer is a rare, aggressive malignancy, with incidence varying geographically. The primary risk factor is HPV infection. Squamous cell carcinoma represents the most common histological subtype, accounting for around 95% of cases. For advanced penile carcinoma, prognosis remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of 16% in stage IV disease. Treatment is largely centered on palliative systemic therapy. This review provides an overview of the evidence on palliative systemic treatment for advanced penile cancer, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, as well as emerging treatment strategies. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the established first-line treatment for advanced penile cancer, but its efficacy is often limited and short-lived. Immune checkpoint inhibitors showed limited but promising efficacy in penile carcinoma, with some patients experiencing durable responses, particularly those with high tumour mutational burden, HPV positivity, or high PD-L1 expression, though further research is needed to identify predictive biomarkers for optimal patient selection. HPV vaccine-based therapies targeting HPV oncoproteins, adoptive T-cell therapies and agents like binatrafusp alfa are showing potential in HPV-associated cancers, though their role in penile cancer remains uncertain. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating potentially synergistic combination therapies, such as HPV vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors or immune therapies combined with chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment for advanced penile cancer, while immunotherapy and targeted therapies show promise but require further investigation. Enrolling patients in clinical trials and conducting early tumour molecular sequencing, if possible, are crucial for improving outcomes and identifying effective treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer remains a major health challenge worldwide, with nearly 1 million new cases annually contributing to more than 650\u2009000 deaths. Epidemiologically, gastric cancer shows substantial geographical variation in incidence, with higher rates in Asia, South America, and eastern Europe, and a rapid increase in early-onset cases among people younger than 50 years. Key risk factors for gastric cancer include Helicobacter pylori infection, diet, obesity, smoking, and genetic predisposition. Early detection through comprehensive diagnostic procedures is crucial for optimising treatment outcomes. Standard treatment approaches for locally advanced gastric cancer include surgical resection, particularly D2 lymphadenectomy, complemented by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There is increasing implementation of minimally invasive surgical techniques for operable disease and integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies for advanced stages. Emerging therapies, such as novel targeted treatments and next-generation immunotherapies, show promise in improving survival and quality of life. Future directions in the management of gastric cancer focus on precision medicine, continued advancement in immunotherapy, novel early detection methods, and a multidisciplinary approach to care. These strategies aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of treatment and prognosis worldwide.",

    "title": "Targeting Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Resistance Mechanisms and Therapeutic Advancements.",
    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most heterogeneous and menacing forms of breast cancer, with no sustainable cure available in the current treatment landscape. Its lack of targets makes it highly unresponsive to various treatment modalities, which is why chemotherapy continues to be the primary form of treatment, despite the high rates of patients developing chemoresistance. In recent years, however, there has been significant progress in identifying and understanding the role of several aspects that might contribute to genomic instability and other hallmarks of cancer, including cellular proteins, immune targets, and epigenetic mechanisms, which are desirable as they permit reversibility easier than the often-adamant genetic changes. A literature review was conducted on the role of various TNBC associated biomarkers, their therapeutic applications, and their role in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance, with a focus on linking both the driving biological mechanisms and emerging treatment options for TNBC. Shifting the focus of treatment to identify crucial tumor cell subpopulations and associated biomarkers, such as local immune cell populations and cancer stem cells, could potentially solve or simplify decades' worth of problems that are associated with TNBC, bolstering early detection and the evolution of precision medicine and treatment. The techniques that can be used here are epigenetic analysis and RNA sequencing. Biomarkers, such as PD-L1, survivin, and ABC transporters, are implicated in several crucial processes that maintain tumors, such as cell proliferation, metastasis, immunosuppression, and stemness. Complex treatment options such as, immunotherapy, pathway inhibition, PARP inhibition, virotherapy, and RNA targeting have been considered for TNBC. Phytochemicals are also being considered as a treatment modality for TNBC, as a supplement to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or as sole treatment.",

    "abstract": "Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1), a liver-secreted protein involved in proliferation and metabolism, and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on the surfaces of various activated immune cells, play critical roles in tumor immunology. Numerous studies have confirmed that FGL1 acts as a ligand for LAG3 and mediates immune evasion by tumor cells. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the research progress in FGL1/LAG3 in terms of its expression, role in the tumor microenvironment, and clinical application. The expression and regulation of FGL1/LAG3 are influenced by multiple cytokines and signaling pathways. In the tumor microenvironment, FGL1/LAG3 modulates tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, gene methylation, oxygen metabolism, and lipid metabolism. FGL1/LAG3 can serve as a prognostic biomarker, independently or in combination with PD-L1/PD-1, and can be targeted using monoclonal antibodies, bi-specific antibodies, and dual-targeted vaccines to restore the proliferation and activation potential of T cells. Additionally, FGL1/LAG3 has demonstrated therapeutic potential when combined with targeted therapies, radiotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and adoptive cell therapy. Overall, FGL1/LAG3 plays a pivotal role in cancer initiation, progression, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",

This study investigates the prognostic and therapeutic implications of copper-induced cell death-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in LUSC using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Five lncRNAs (AC010328.1, LINC01740, AL358613.2, MIR3945HG, AC002467.1) were identified as independent prognostic markers and incorporated into a risk score model to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups. Survival analyses revealed significant differences in overall survival, with the high-risk group exhibiting higher immune evasion potential and poorer response to immunotherapy. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted the involvement of these lncRNAs in drug metabolism and tumor biology. Furthermore, tumor mutation burden analysis and immune dysfunction evaluation confirmed the clinical relevance of the model, identifying high-risk patients as more sensitive to targeted drugs such as Quizartinib and Dasatinib. A Nomogram integrating lncRNA risk scores and clinical factors demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival outcomes. This study provides novel biomarkers and actionable insights for improving prognostic assessment and personalizing immunotherapy strategies for LUSC patients.",

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer, yet targeted and immune therapeutic strategies remain limited. DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) is one of the hypoxia-related genes, and its role in tumors has begun to gain attention. However, the specific mechanism of DDIT4 in LUAD is still unclear. Therefore, in-depth exploration of its role and mechanism in LUAD has high clinical value and innovative significance, and can provide a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of LUAD. Bioinformatics analysis identified DDIT4 as a poor prognostic factor positively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumors with high DDIT4 expression exhibited increased immune infiltration and significantly higher levels of immune checkpoint genes, including PD-L1 and PD-1. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that DDIT4 could serve as a predictive biomarker for LUAD therapy response. Experimental validation demonstrated that DDIT4 expression was significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues and further induced under hypoxic conditions. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that DDIT4 may regulate LUAD progression via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Functional experiments confirmed that DDIT4 promotes LUAD cell migration, invasion, and EMT through this pathway. Rescue experiments further validated the mechanistic role of DDIT4, and in vivo studies confirmed its ability to enhance LUAD metastasis. In conclusion, DDIT4 functions as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD by modulating EMT and metastasis through MAPK/ERK signaling. Its association with immune infiltration and therapy response suggests that targeting DDIT4 may enhance immunotherapy and personalized treatment strategies for LUAD patients.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-Programmed Death-1 antibodies (aPD-1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially colocalize with T cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD-1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We find that pretreatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.",

Traditional therapies, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, often exhibit limited efficacy and are associated with significant side effects due to systemic drug exposure. Microneedles (MNs), as an emerging drug delivery system, offer multiple advantages, including safety, painlessness, minimal invasiveness, and controlled drug release. Among these, hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) stand out due to their extracellular matrix-like structure and swelling-induced continuous hydrogel channels, which enable the direct delivery of therapeutic agents into the tumor microenvironment (TME). This approach enhances drug bioavailability while reducing systemic toxicity, establishing HMNs as a promising platform for melanoma treatment. This review highlights recent advancements in HMNs for melanoma therapy, focusing on their applications in biomarker extraction for early diagnosis and their role in supporting multimodal treatment strategies, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and combination therapy. Furthermore, the current matrix materials and fabrication techniques for HMNs are discussed. Finally, the limitations of HMNs in melanoma treatment are critically analyzed, and recommendations for future research and development are provided.",

Data on patient demographics, tumor biomarkers, treatment modalities, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 72 (95%) had non-small cell lung cancer, predominantly adenocarcinoma (83%). Patients with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations (n = 19, 25%) had an increased median overall survival (OS) of 3.40 years compared with 1.39 years for those without EGFR mutations (p = 0.01) as well as increased median survival after spinal metastasis (1.73 years vs 0.98 years, p = 0.01). Patients with KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations (n = 16, 21%) had a decreased median OS of 0.71 years compared with 2.60 years for those without KRAS mutations (p = 0.03).

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.0 and 3.1 months in the D\u00a0+ M arm and control arm, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 4.3 months (95% confidence interval 3.3-8.9 months) and 8.0 months (95% confidence interval 3.1-14.9 months) in the D\u00a0+ M and control arms, respectively. In the D\u00a0+ M arm, 4 (9%) patients reported grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events. The I2 substudy failed to demonstrate an activity of D\u00a0+ M in heavily pretreated patients with SCCHN previously exposed to anti-PD(L)1. No benefit was seen in PFS and OS.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a prevalent malignancy that necessitates personalized chemotherapy, especially with the advent of molecular-targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In Japan, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for unresectable advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer; however, their use in preoperative therapy for colorectal cancer has not yet been approved. Globally, neoadjuvant immunotherapy has demonstrated promising outcomes in colorectal cancer cases with high immunogenicity, including microsatellite instability-high and deficient mismatch repair. We report a case of a microsatellite instability-high, clinically unresectable, locally advanced ascending colon cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which showed significant tumor shrinkage, facilitating standard surgery while avoiding adjunct organ resection. The patient, a 70-year-old male, experienced chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and computed tomography confirmed a diagnosis of ascending colon cancer with suspected invasion into the descending duodenum. Although curative resection was technically feasible with pancreatoduodenectomy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was selected to reduce tumor size, considering the patient's overall condition. Companion diagnostics revealed microsatellite instability-high status and  This case highlights the potential of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in reducing surgical invasiveness in patients with colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Disulfidptosis is an emerging type of programmed cell death related to ROS accumulation and aberrant disulfide bond formation. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy characterized by a high synthesis rate of disulfide bond-rich proteins and chronic oxidative stress. However, the relationship between disulfidptosis and MM is still unclear. Using the non-negative matrix factorization and lasso algorithm, we constructed the disulfidptosis-associated subtypes and the prognostic model on the GEO dataset. We further explored genetic mutation mapping, protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment, drug sensitivity, drug prediction, and immune infiltration analysis among subtypes and risk subgroups. To improve the clinical benefits, we combined risk scores and clinical metrics to build a nomogram. Finally,  By cluster analysis, we obtained three subtypes with C2 having a worse prognosis than C3. Consistently, C2 exhibited significantly lower sensitivity to doxorubicin and lenalidomide, as well as a higher propensity for T-cell depletion and a non-responsive state to immunotherapy. Similarly, in the subsequent prognostic model, the high-scoring group had a worse prognosis and a higher probability of T-cell dysfunction, immunotherapy resistance, and cancer cell self-renewal. DRGs and risk genes were widely mutated in cancers. Subtypes and risk subgroups differed in ROS metabolism and the p53 signaling pathway. We further identified eight genes differentially expressed in risk subgroups as drug targets against MM. Then 27 drugs targeting the high-risk group were predicted. Based on the DRGs and risk genes, we constructed the miRNA and TF regulatory networks. The nomogram of combined ISS, age, and risk score showed good predictive performance. qRT-PCR of cell lines and clinical specimens provided further support for prognostic modeling. Our research reveals the prognostic value of disulfidptosis in MM and provides new perspectives for identifying heterogeneity and therapeutic targets.",

However, only a subset of patients responds to ICI therapy, even though immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Initially, treatment was administered to patients on the basis of expression levels of one of the targets of ICI therapy, programmed cell death ligand 1. In clinical trials, the high response rate of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients to ICI therapy supported the basic premise of cancer immunotherapy, that tumour-specific mutated proteins trigger an immune response. Tumour mutational burden subsequently emerged as a potential biomarker for response to ICI therapy.

Nonetheless, despite the recent success of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, such response rates in cancer patients have been limited to tumors encompassing specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. The altered metabolic activity of cancer cells shapes the anti-tumor immune response by affecting the activity of immune cells. However, it remains mostly unknown how the altered metabolic activity of cancer cells impacts their resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. Here, we found that tumor cell-derived lactic acid renders the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors by inhibiting the interaction between the PD-L1 protein and anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, we showed that the combination therapy of targeting PD-L1 with our PD-L1 antibody-drug conjugate (PD-L1-ADC) and reducing lactic acid with the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) inhibitor, AZD3965, can effectively treat the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors. The findings of this study provide a new mechanism of how lactic acid induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and suggest a potential combination treatment to overcome the tumor resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy.",

DNA methylation plays well-appreciated melanoma cell-intrinsic roles, including silencing tumor-suppressor genes, regulating genomic stability, deregulating expression of oncogenes to potentiate proliferative signaling and tumor migration. With the recent success of immunological therapies for melanoma, important roles for DNA methylation are also emerging at the interface between melanoma and immune cells with the potential to regulate the anti-tumor immune response. These newly recognized roles for DNA methylation in controlling melanoma cell immunogenicity, expression of MHC and immune checkpoint molecules as well as T cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment raise the possibility of using DNA methylation to develop improved therapies and methylation-based biomarkers. In addition to reviewing the \"immune dimension\" of DNA methylation, we summarize recent developments with potential clinical applications in melanoma, such as targeted DNA methylation editing, single-cell methylation approaches, and measurement of circulating methylated DNA. An improved understanding of the immune roles of DNA methylation presents an exciting opportunity for continued improvement of care and outcomes for patients with melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress anti-tumor immunity in tumor bearers, which leads to tumor progression. Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) demonstrated significant efficiency against various cancers; however, their success rate is limited to approximately 20-30% in patients with cancer. To address this limitation, predictive biomarkers and combination therapies are required. Since MDSCs are supposed to be crucial for the resistance to ICBs, targeting MDSCs could be a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), widely used as prophylaxis and therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN), has been shown to significantly reduce its incidence. However, G-CSF has been reported to promote tumor progression caused by the enhancing the proliferation of MDSCs. We found that G-CSF enhances the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs through the upregulation of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1). GGT1, an enzyme hydrolyzing extracellular glutathione, is reported to be a marker for early-stage cancers and promote tumor progression. It is suggested that GGT1 increases glutamate levels through glutathione hydrolysis and that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling enhances the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs. Moreover, in FN mouse models, we observed that G-CSF promoted tumor progression, while the inhibition of GGT abolished. Together, the inhibition of GGT can mitigate the tumor-promoting effects of MDSCs without compromising the beneficial effect of G-CSF. These insights should lead to the safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "CD19-directed cancer immunotherapies, based on engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs, CAR-T cells) or the systemic administration of bispecific T cell-engaging (TCE) antibodies, have shown impressive clinical responses in relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, more than half of patients relapse after CAR-T or TCE therapy, with antigen escape or lineage switching accounting for one-third of disease recurrences. To minimize tumor escape, dual-targeting CAR-T cell therapies simultaneously targeting CD19 and CD22 have been developed and validated both preclinically and clinically. We have generated the first dual-targeting strategy for B-cell malignancies based on CD22 CAR-T cells secreting an anti-CD19 TCE antibody (CAR-STAb-T) and conducted a comprehensive preclinical characterization comparing its therapeutic potential in B-ALL with that of previously validated dual-targeting CD19/CD22 tandem CAR cells (TanCAR-T cells) and co-administration of two single-targeting CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells (pooled CAR-T cells). We demonstrate that CAR-STAb-T cells efficiently redirect bystander T cells, resulting in higher cytotoxicity of B-ALL cells than dual-targeting CAR-T cells at limiting effector:target ratios. Furthermore, when antigen loss was replicated in a heterogeneous B-ALL cell model, CAR-STAb T cells induced more potent and effective cytotoxic responses than dual-targeting CAR-T cells in both short- and long-term co-culture assays, reducing the risk of CD19-positive leukemia escape. In vivo, CAR-STAb-T cells also controlled leukemia progression more efficiently than dual-targeting CAR-T cells in patient-derived xenograft mouse models under T cell-limiting conditions. CD22 CAR-T cells secreting CD19 T-cell engagers show an enhanced control of B-ALL progression compared with CD19/CD22 dual CAR-based therapies, supporting their potential for clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is revolutionizing precision medicine by enabling tailored therapeutic strategies based on an individual genetic and molecular profile. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a distinct subclass of endogenous non-coding RNAs, have recently emerged as key regulators of drug resistance, tumor progression, and therapeutic responses. Their covalently closed circular structure provides exceptional stability and resistance to exonuclease degradation, positioning them as reliable biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets in cancer management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between circRNAs and pharmacogenomics, focusing on their role in modulating drug metabolism, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity profiles. We examine how circRNA-mediated regulatory networks influence chemotherapy resistance, alter targeted therapy responses, and impact immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, we discuss emerging experimental tools and bioinformatics techniques for studying circRNAs, including multi-omics integration, machine learning-driven biomarker discovery, and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Beyond their diagnostic potential, circRNAs are being actively explored as therapeutic agents and drug delivery vehicles. Recent advancements in circRNA-based vaccines, engineered CAR-T cells, and synthetic circRNA therapeutics highlight their transformative potential in oncology. Furthermore, we address the challenges of standardization, reproducibility, and clinical translation, emphasizing the need for rigorous biomarker validation and regulatory frameworks to facilitate their integration into clinical practice. By incorporating circRNA profiling into pharmacogenomic strategies, this review underscores a paradigm shift toward highly personalized cancer therapies. circRNAs hold immense potential to overcome drug resistance, enhance treatment efficacy, and optimize patient outcomes, marking a significant advancement in precision oncology.",

Based on the GSE53625 expression profile data, we identified molecular subtypes with significant survival differences through consensus cluster analysis. Subsequently, univariate Cox, multivariate Cox, and LASSO-Cox regression analysis were used to establish risk stratification models. The transcriptome data of the TCGA-ESCC cohort and the GSE160269 single-cell sequencing dataset were integrated to verify the biological significance of the model, and further analyze the heterogeneity of the tumor immune microenvironment, explore the differences in the intercellular communication network, and screen potential targeted drugs, providing a theoretical basis for subsequent translational research. We identified two distinct patterns of disulfidptosis expression with significant differences in overall survival. Then, we constructed the prognostic signature of disulfidptosis, and results showed patients with high score had worse prognosis. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that the constructed prognostic signature was an independent prognostic factor and was validated in an independent validation set. The two subgroups differed in the proportion of immune cell infiltration and related signaling pathways in ESCC. The exploration of immunotherapy data confirmed our prognostic signature also had certain predictive power for immunotherapy. Drug screening suggested AZD8186 and JQ1 as potential therapies for high-score patients.

Subsequently, the single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithms were utilized to assess immune infiltration and immune evasion. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and COX regression analysis were used to identify an HGL prognosis-related signature. Based on spatial transcriptome and histological data, we analyzed the expression of these genes in HCC and explored the function of Homer Scaffold Protein 1 (HOMER1) in HCC cells. We identified 72 differentially expressed HGL genes and two HGL clusters. Cluster2, with better survival ( We identified a signature with great predictive efficacy and discovered a gene, HOMER1, that influences the malignant progression of HCC with the potential to become a novel therapeutic target.",

Here, we demonstrated the role of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fes, abundantly expressed in immune cells, as an innate intracellular immune checkpoint. Host Fes-deficiency delayed tumor onset in a gene dose-dependent manner and improved tumor control, survival, doxorubicin efficacy, and anti-PD-1 therapy sensitization in murine triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma models. These effects were associated with a shift to an anti-tumorigenic immune microenvironment. Fes-deficient macrophages displayed increased Toll-like receptor signaling, proinflammatory cytokine production, antigen presentation to and activation of T cells, leading to increased cancer cell killing in vitro and tumor control in vivo. This study highlights Fes as an innate immune checkpoint with potential as a therapeutic target and a predictive biomarker to guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is one of the most common non-melanoma skin cancers, and particularly challenging to treat in advanced or metastatic stages. Traditional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation, often result in limited efficacy and severe side effects. Cosibelimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, has emerged as a promising immunotherapy for advanced CSCC. In this review, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of cosibelimab by analyzing its mechanism of action, clinical trial data, and its role compared to other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and cemiplimab. We synthesized the available preclinical and clinical data on cosibelimab, focusing on published Phase I and II trial results involving 76 patients. Objective response rates (ORRs), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profiles were compared between cosibelimab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab. Mechanistic insights into cosibelimab's dual action, including PD-L1 blockade and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), were also explored. Phase II trials demonstrated an ORR of 47.5%, with a median PFS of 12.9 months in advanced CSCC patients. Cosibelimab demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with predominantly mild to moderate adverse events. Comparative analysis with pembrolizumab and cemiplimab showed similar efficacy, although long-term survival data for cosibelimab is still emerging. Given its efficacy and safety, cosibelimab holds promise not only as a monotherapy but also for future exploration in combination regimens and broader oncologic indications. Future trials are required to validate its long-term outcomes, including overall survival, and to explore its use in combination therapies and neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings.",

    "abstract": "The advent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer immunotherapy, enabling remarkable long-term outcomes and improved survival, particularly with ICB combination treatments. However, clinical benefits remain confined to a subset of patients, and life-threatening immune-related adverse effects pose a significant challenge. This limited efficacy is attributed to cancer heterogeneity, which is mediated by ligand-receptor interactions, exosomes, secreted factors, and key transcription factors. Oncogenic regulators like E2F1 and MYC drive metastatic tumor environments and intertwine with immunoregulatory pathways, impairing T cell function and reducing immunotherapy effectiveness. To address these challenges, FDA-approved biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, help to identify patients most likely to benefit from ICB. Yet, current biomarkers have limitations, making treatment decisions difficult. Recently, T cells-the primary target of ICB-have emerged as promising biomarkers. This review explores the relationship between cancer drivers and immune response, and emphasizes the role of CD8+ T cells in predicting and monitoring ICB efficacy. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells correlate with positive clinical outcomes in many cancers, yet obtaining tumor tissue remains complex, limiting its practical use. Conversely, circulating T cell subsets are more accessible and have shown promise as predictive biomarkers. Specifically, memory and progenitor exhausted T cells are associated with favorable immunotherapy responses, while terminally exhausted T cells negatively correlate with ICB efficacy. Ultimately, combining biomarkers enhances predictive accuracy, as demonstrated by integrating TMB/PD-L1 expression with CD8+ T cell frequency. Computational models incorporating cancer and immune signatures could further refine patient stratification, advancing personalized immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination repair (HRR) is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA damage. Despite its importance, HRR's role in cancer progression is not fully elucidated. Here, this work shows that nuclear-localized branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) acts as a modulator of HRR, promoting cell resistance against DNA damage-inducing therapy in breast cancer. Mechanistically, this work demonstrates that BCKDK is localized in the nucleus and phosphorylates RNF8 at Ser157, preventing the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RAD51, thereby facilitating HRR-mediated DNA repair under replication stress. Notably, aberrant expression of the BCKDK/p-RNF8/RAD51 axis correlates with breast cancer progression and poor patient survival. Furthermore, this work identifies a small molecule inhibitor of BCKDK, GSK180736A, that disrupts its HRR function and exhibits strong tumor suppression when combined with DNA damage-inducing drugs. Collectively, this study reveals a new role of BCKDK in regulating HRR, independent of its metabolic function, presenting it as a potential therapeutic target and predictive biomarker in breast cancer.",

TNBC is a heterogeneous disease characterized by lack of expression of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), resulting conventional hormonal therapies are ineffective for its management. Despite various therapeutic approaches have been explored, but no definitive solution has been found yet for TNBC. Current treatments options are chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, although, these therapies have some limitations, such as the development of resistance to anti-cancer drugs, and off-target toxicity, which remain primary obstacles and significant challenges for TNBC. Several findings have shown that EVs exhibit significant therapeutic promise in many diseases, and a similar important role has been observed in various types of tumor. Studies suggest that EVs may offer a potential solution for the management of TNBC. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of EVs in TNBC, emphasizing their involvement in disease progression, diagnosis and therapeutic approach, as well as their potential as biomarkers and drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Despite progress in treatment, many metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients still experience progression after first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), necessitating effective second-line options. While guidelines endorse combination therapies, accessibility limitations often restrict therapy to TKI monotherapy. Existing decision-making relies on limited evidence, lacking direct comparisons between the leading second-line options (cabozantinib and nivolumab) which surpass everolimus in advanced mRCC. To address this gap, this study compares the efficacy of TKI versus nivolumab in second line while investigating factors influencing outcomes. This was a retrospective cohort study. Turkish Oncology Group Kidney Cancer Consortium includes more than 1000 mRCC patients from 13 centers in T\u00fcrkiye. It has the largest national data. We extracted 214 patients treated with a TKI in the first line and nivolumab or TKI in the second line. The median overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were similar in the TKI-TKI and TKI-immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI; 41.1 and 44.8\u2009months,  Our analysis revealed no significant difference in OS between patients receiving ICIs or TKIs as second-line therapy. In the subgroup of patients with elevated NLR, ICI therapy was found to cause no improvement in OS. This finding suggests the potential utility of NLR as a biomarker to guide targeted selection of ICI therapy among patients progressing after first-line TKIs. Furthermore, our study identified other noteworthy prognostic factors influencing outcomes, including the presence of bone or liver metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk score.",

The gut microbiota, particularly its bacterial composition, plays a crucial role in the development and function of the immune system. Moreover, metabolites produced by the gut microbiota can significantly impact both systemic immune responses and central nervous system (CNS) immunity. Sodium butyrate is a key metabolite produced by the gut microbiota and, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, can enhance the anti-tumor immunity of cytotoxic CD8 RNA-seq assay in glioma cell and biomedical databases, including ONCOMINE, GEPIA and TCGA were incorporated. Subsequently, the inhibitory effect of sodium butyrate on glioma cells and its related mechanisms were assessed through Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Flow Cytometry, Western blot (WB), reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and other  We discovered that deacetylation-associated gene expression is significantly increased in glioma patients and affects patient survival time. Moreover, we found sodium butyrate promoted glioma cell apoptosis, disrupted the cell cycle, and inhibited tumor growth. Additionally, sodium butyrate may upregulate PD-L1 expression in glioma cells by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. The experimental results demonstrated that this combination therapy significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival in an orthotopic murine glioma model. Moreover, combination therapy led to an increase in the proportion of probiotic bacteria in the mouse gut microbiota, resulting in elevated levels of antitumor metabolites and a decrease in metabolites that affect immune cell function.",

The current therapeutic interventions for melanoma, such as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy, are not efficient enough to treat melanoma. The current melanoma care is associated with limitations, such as late diagnosis and staging, false positives, treatment resistance, immune-related side effects, lack of standardization, challenges in metastatic melanoma cure, high treatment costs, recurrence, etc. Conventional therapies have poor anti- cancer efficacy due to premature drug degradation, severe adverse effects owing to systemic drug exposure, and low drug concentration at the malignancy site. Moreover, the current diagnosis for melanoma is associated with painful sample collection techniques, limited imaging techniques, limited understanding of genetic markers, etc., leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. An extensive literature review on Microneedles (MNs) for melanoma diagnosis and treatment was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases from 2012 to 2025. This mini-review presents the advantages of MNs over current therapy, their formulation aspects, and their advancements for the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. MNs, an emerging drug delivery system, can efficiently penetrate the skin barriers and form reversible microchannels to deliver the drug at melanoma sites without drug leakage, mitigating the adverse effects and increasing drug accumulation. MNs also provide an excellent platform to integrate novel and conventional therapies by encompassing discrete therapeutic agents in a single matrix. Moreover, MNs can capture biomarkers by absorbing the skin Interstitial Fluid (ISF) and facilitate diagnosis by minimal biological samples.",

The preclinical data has shown that enhancing the number of specific microbial species could restore the patients' response to cancer drugs and the microbial biomarkers may play a vital role in cancer diagnostics. The elucidation of detailed interactions of the human microbiota with cancer would not only help identify the novel drug targets but would also enhance the efficacy of existing drugs.

These 50 DEGs were then subjected to GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses, along with genome-wide GSEA. the first 5 core genes were identified and visualized using Cytoscape through the PPI network. Then the expression of ZG16 and CLCA1 in normal and tumor tissues were analyzed using GSE39582 and TCGA datasets, and correlation analysis, and survival analysis were performed. The expression of ZG16 and CLCA1 in CRC cells was verified by qRT-PCR, and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities were detected by CCK-8, scratch assay, clone formation assay, and Transwell assay. The expression levels of ZG16 and CLCA1 were significantly lower in CRC tissues than in normal tissues. Survival analysis showed that low expression of ZG16 and CLCA1 was associated with poor survival outcomes. Multifactorial analysis showed that low expression of ZG16 and CLCA1 was an independent risk factor affecting tumor prognosis. Cellular experiments showed that cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited after overexpression of ZG16 and CLCA1. Correlation analysis showed that ZG16 and CLCA1 expression levels were positively correlated and the correlation was statistically significant. GSEA enrichment analysis based on CLCA1-related genes and ZG16-related genes (FDR\u2009<\u20090.25, P\u2009<\u20090.05) revealed that the related genes of both genes were closely related to the GnRH signaling pathway. CLCA1 and ZG16, which are lowly expressed in CRC tissues, are associated with poor prognosis of CRC and may be one of the markers for diagnostic screening and prediction of prognostic outcome in CRC. Meanwhile, CLCA1 and ZG16 may also be new targets for tumor immunotherapy.",

ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO-ICTRP, HealthCanadaCT were searched for antineoplastic pharmacological and interventional CT involving patients with SGC from the trials database creation until August 6th, 2024. CT characteristics and status were collected. 134 clinical trials met inclusion criteria.

These tumors not only have a unique anatomical distribution but also exhibit specific biological and clinical characteristics. Given the high biological overlap between intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) and IP-LBCLs, and the fact that IVLBCL is confined to the intravascular microenvironment, IVLBCL is currently included in the category of IP-LBCLs. IP-LBCLs are associated with suboptimal prognosis. However, advancements in biomarker detection technologies have facilitated novel therapeutic approaches for this disease entity. This review aims to summarize and analyze the latest research progress in IP-LBCLs, with a focus on new treatment strategies in the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. It is intended to further understand the biological characteristics, treatment, and latest advancements of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a rare but aggressive malignancy that follows normal or aberrant pregnancies. Until the advent of immunotherapy in 2017, surgery and chemotherapy were the standard treatment modalities, with chemotherapy remaining the cornerstone. However, chemoresistance and high-risk disease present significant challenges in managing GTN. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have offered new hope for managing these difficult cases. This review provides the comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying ICIs in GTN, and explores the potential synergy of combining ICIs with targeted therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. We also provide an overview of the latest evidence on the use of ICIs in treating GTN, focusing on their effectiveness in both low- and high-risk cases, as well as in chemorefractory settings. In addition, we discuss ongoing clinical trials, immune-related adverse events associated with ICIs, biomarker-driven approaches, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and the challenges posed with ICIs resistance. The review also explores future directions, including the integration of ICIs into standard regimens, the potential for personalized treatment based on tumor biology, and the importance of fertility preservation in young patients with GTN. In conclusion, while challenges remain, immunotherapy represents a promising frontier in GTN treatment, with the potential to improve outcomes and provide a more personalized approach to care.",

Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for advanced HCC, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy through targeted drug delivery while minimizing systemic side effects. However, the heterogeneous nature of HCC leads to variable responses to HAIC, highlighting the necessity for reliable predictive indicators to tailor personalized treatment strategies. This review explores the factors influencing HAIC success, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics, biomarkers, genomic profiles, and advanced imaging techniques such as radiomics and deep learning models. Additionally, the synergistic potential of HAIC combined with immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies is examined, demonstrating improved survival outcomes. Prognostic scoring systems and nomograms that integrate clinical, molecular, and imaging data are discussed as superior tools for individualized prognostication compared to traditional staging systems. Understanding these predictors is essential for optimizing HAIC efficacy and enhancing survival and quality of life for patients with advanced HCC. Future research directions include large-scale prospective studies, integration of multi-omics data, and advancements in artificial intelligence to refine predictive models and further personalize treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is a potential therapeutic target, while dysregulated ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) may drive tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study integrated multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify FRGs associated with LGG prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pseudotime trajectory analysis were performed to investigate their functional roles. Key findings were validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We identified 345 FRGs associated with LGG prognosis, which are involved in oxidative stress response, cell proliferation, and immune regulation. High-risk patients exhibited an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with elevated levels of M2 macrophages and Treg cells but reduced CD8 Our study provides comprehensive insights into the role of FRGs in LGG prognosis and tumor microenvironment regulation, with a particular focus on the NUAK2 gene. As a potential therapeutic target, NUAK2's critical role in tumor progression and immune evasion offers a new direction for LGG treatment.

    "abstract": "Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPCa) presents de novo or represents significant disease progression and requires systemic treatment. However, progression to castration resistance is inevitable. The treatment landscape has evolved with the introduction of intensified systemic therapy, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with either androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (doublet therapy) or combined therapy with both agents (triplet therapy). Landmark trials such as CHAARTED, STAMPEDE, LATITUDE, ENZAMET, and TITAN have established combination therapies as the standard of care, demonstrating significant overall survival benefits. More recently, triplet therapy-integrating ADT, docetaxel, and an ARSI-has emerged as an effective approach, particularly in high-volume metastatic disease, as supported by ARASENS and PEACE-1. Advances in imaging, such as PSMA PET-CT, have improved disease detection, allowing earlier detection of metastasis and appropriate therapy. Similarly, genomic profiling has enabled biomarker-driven, personalized treatment strategies. The role of treatment of the primary tumor, by either radiation therapy or cytoreductive prostatectomy, in low-volume disease continues to be explored. As novel therapies, targeted agents, and immunotherapies undergo investigation, optimizing treatment selection based on disease burden, molecular characteristics, and patient factors will be essential.

Patients with very early tumors (cT1a) can benefit from endoscopic therapy. However, patients with locally advanced disease require multimodal therapies that may combine surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the treatment of locally advanced upper GI adenocarcinomas. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of curative treatment, with perioperative chemotherapy emerging as the standard of care. While preoperative chemoradiation has demonstrated some benefits in esophageal and GEJ cancers, recent data suggest a more limited role for radiation going forward. Immunotherapy has shown some promise in both the adjuvant and perioperative settings but has yet to establish definitive survival benefit. The integration of HER2-targeted therapies into treatment regimens for HER2-positive locally advanced gastroesophageal cancers has not yielded significant improvements, underscoring the need for more effective strategies. Ongoing research focuses on better predictive biomarkers, personalized treatment approaches, and potential organ preservation strategies for patients achieving a clinical complete response. Continued advancements in treatment modalities and precision medicine are critical to improving survival for patients with locally advanced upper GI adenocarcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a \"cold\" immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived \u03b1v\u03b23/\u03b1v\u03b25-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-\u0263 producing CD8 We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.",

Moreover, the heterogeneous variability in the tumor microenvironment is responsible for existing therapy failure. With the advent of biomimetic nanoparticles as a novel and intriguing platform, researchers have exploited the inherent functionalities of the Cluster of Differentiation proteins (CD) as cell surface biomarkers and imparted the nanocarriers with enhanced homologous tumor targetability, immune evasion capability, and stealth properties, paving the way for improved therapy and diagnosis. This article explores pathogenesis and the multifaceted role of immune cells in non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, the agenda of this article is to shed light on biomimetic nanoarchitectonics with respect to their fabrication, evaluation, and applications unraveling their synergistic effect with conventional therapies. Further discussion mentions the hurdles in clinical translation with viable solutions. The regulatory bottlenecks underscore the need for a regulatory roadmap with respect to commercialization.

Different treatment strategies are now available for cancer therapy based on its type, molecular subtype and other factors including overall health, the stage of disease and cancer molecular profile. Immunotherapy is emerging as a potential addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other targeted therapies, but also considered a mainstay therapy mode. This combination is an area of active investigation in order to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. Due to the complexity and dynamic of cancer's ecosystem, novel therapeutic targets and strategies need continued research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms within the tumour microenvironment. From the genetic point of view, several signatures ranging from a few mutated genes to hundreds of them have been identified and associated with therapy resistance and metastatic potential. ML techniques and AI can enhance the predictive potential of genetic signatures and model the prognosis.

    "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer of the pleural lining, primarily associated with asbestos exposure. Despite advancements in multimodal treatment, patient survival remains poor. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has emerged as a crucial process driving MPM pathogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying EMT in MPM, including key signaling pathways such as TGF-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and PI3K/Akt. We also discuss the diagnostic and prognostic significance of EMT-related biomarkers and emerging targeted therapies aimed at reversing EMT or exploiting EMT-induced vulnerabilities. Additionally, recent clinical trials, including the MARS 2 trial, are reviewed to provide insight into the evolving treatment landscape.",

    "abstract": "The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential, especially when a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is administered. Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors or Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been assessed in both clinical and preclinical studies; the addition of radiotherapy activates immunomodulatory mechanisms materialized by an effect similar to \"in situ\" vaccination or the \"abscopal\" distant response of lesions outside the irradiation field. The new therapeutic targets (T cell immune-receptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), Lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG-3), and T cell Ig- and mucin-domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3)) associated with traditional ICIs and radiotherapy open new perspectives to the concept of immuno-radiotherapy. The dynamic evaluation of T lymphocyte expression involved in the antitumor immune response, both in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in the tumor itself, could have biomarker value in assessing the response to combination therapy with traditional and new ICIs in association with irradiation. Preclinical data justify the initiation of clinical trials in various tumor pathologies to explore this concept.",

    "abstract": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), initially identified as a neuronal guidance protein, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator in cancer biology. Beyond its role in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review explores the diverse functions of NRP1 in cancer, encompassing its influence on tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. NRP1 interacts with several key signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), semaphorins, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various malignancies, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Therapeutically, targeting NRP1 holds promise as a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of regular treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Strategies involving NRP1-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and gene silencing techniques, are being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. Despite challenges in specificity and delivery, advances in understanding NRP1 biology offer new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. Although several types of cancer cells can express NRPs, the role of NRPs in tumor pathogenesis is largely unknown. Future investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects and mechanisms of NRPs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of neuronal, endothelial, and cancer cells. The novel frameworks or multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple databases to better understand cancer's molecular and clinical features, develop personalized therapies, and help identify biomarkers. This review highlights the pivotal role of NRP1 in cancer pathogenesis and discusses its implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes, highlighting the role of OMICS in targeting cancer patients for personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric primary brain tumors pose significant therapeutic challenges due to their aggressive nature and the critical environment of the developing brain. Traditional modalities like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy often achieve limited success in high-grade gliomas and embryonal tumors. Tumor-treating fields (TTfields), a non-invasive therapy delivering alternating electric fields, has emerged as a promising approach to disrupt tumor cell division through mechanisms such as mitotic disruption, DNA damage, and tumor microenvironment modulation. TTfields are thought to selectively target dividing tumor cells while sparing healthy, non-dividing cells. While TTfields therapy is FDA-approved for the management of glioblastoma and other cancers, its application in pediatric brain tumors remains under investigation. Preclinical studies reveal its potential in medulloblastoma and ependymoma models, while observational data suggest its safety and feasibility in children. Current research focuses on optimizing TTfields' efficacy through advanced technologies, including high-intensity arrays, skull remodeling, and integration with immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovative device-based therapies like magnetic field-based technologies further expand the treatment possibilities. As clinical trials progress, TTfields and related modalities offer hope for addressing unmet needs in pediatric neuro-oncology, especially for tumors in challenging locations. Future directions include biomarker identification, tailored protocols, and novel therapeutic combinations to enhance outcomes in pediatric brain tumor management.",

    "title": "Mapping the rapid growth of multi-omics in tumor immunotherapy: Bibliometric evidence of technology convergence and paradigm shifts.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to fill the knowledge gap in systematically mapping the evolution of omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research through a bibliometric lens. While omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)provide multidimensional molecular profiling, their synergistic potential with immunotherapy remains underexplored in large-scale trend analyses. A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on \"PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade\" has transitioned toward \"machine learning,\" \"multi-omics,\" and \"lncRNA,\" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy. Moreover, spatial omics has confirmed ENPP1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma. Citation trends underscore clinical translation, particularly mutation-guided therapies. Omics technologies are transforming tumor immunotherapy by enhancing biomarker discovery and improving therapeutic predictions. Future advancements will necessitate longitudinal omics monitoring, AI-driven multi-omics integration, and international collaboration to accelerate clinical translation. This study presents a systematic framework for exploring emerging research frontiers and offers insights for optimizing precision-driven immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Integrated multi-omics reveal lactate metabolism-related gene signatures and PYGL in predicting HNSCC prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy.",
    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment faces significant clinical challenges. Lactate metabolism plays a crucial role in the initiation of many cancers and the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the prognostic significance of lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and the role of TME in HNSCC require further elucidation. We built a prognostic multigene signature with LMRGs and systematically correlated the risk signature with immunological characteristics and immunotherapy efficacy. Next, a series of single-cell sequencing analyses were used to characterize lactate metabolism in TME. Finally, single-cell sequencing analysis, immunofluorescence analyses, and a series of in vitro experiments were used to explore the role of PYGL in HNSCC. Potential drugs targeting PYGL were screened using AutoDock 4.2. A prognostic multigene signature based on LMRGs was developed, which effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients in the low-risk group exhibited reduced lactate metabolism, higher CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration, and improved response to immunotherapy. Single-cell sequencing revealed that tumor cells had the most active lactate metabolism compared to other cells in the TME. PYGL, identified as the most critical prognostic gene, was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and played a role in inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization. Knockdown of PYGL led to reduced lactate levels, and its expression was inversely correlated with CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration. Furthermore, PYGL was involved in copper-dependent cell death, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Drug screening identified elesclomol, which showed promising results in PYGL-knockdown cells. The study established a robust LMRGs-based prognostic model that not only predicts patient survival but also correlates with the immune microenvironment in HNSCC. PYGL emerged as a key biomarker with significant implications for both prognosis and therapeutic intervention. Its role in regulating lactate metabolism and immune suppression suggests that targeting PYGL could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies. This research provides a foundation for future clinical strategies aimed at improving outcomes in HNSCC by modulating the tumor's metabolic and immune landscapes.",

Disease heterogeneity and rapid progression pose major challenges for effective management and identification of actionable biomarkers. Conventional therapies often fail to successfully achieve disease control, urging the development of novel, personalized approaches. In recent years, anti-tumour immunotherapy approaches in both pre-clinical and clinical settings have boomed. However, the efficacy of these strategies has been limited by the low mutational burden in some tumours, which hinders neoantigen presentation and the identification of BLCA-specific signatures. Cancer-associated aberrant glycosylation presents a unique opportunity for identifying BLCA-specific glycosignatures and developing innovative targeted therapeutics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical challenges in BLCA management and emerging novel therapies. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of glycosylation alterations as a unique opportunity for developing glycan-based therapies, potentially revolutionizing BLCA treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "While neoadjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma dates to the earliest multidisciplinary approaches, the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has renewed enthusiasm and research into its use. Although neoadjuvant therapy has remained mostly investigative through single-institutional clinical trials for mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, new data have emerged to support its use. A narrative review was conducted by the American Head and Neck Society to address current literature, evolving research, and gaps in knowledge surrounding neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant ICIs, most notably agents targeting anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1), are a promising approach for bolstering antitumor immunity prior to ablating local structures. While neoadjuvant therapy may allow for an individualized approach, biomarkers to guide patient selection are limited. Potential benefits include de-escalation of subsequent treatment, but neoadjuvant therapy for curable disease also carries a small but real risk of progression and compromise of curative options. Measures of response include pathologic, clinical, and radiographic, but there are rapidly expanding capabilities in new diagnostics, such as circulating tumor DNA, with the emerging potential to provide objective quantification of disease burden. Further neoadjuvant strategies include response adaptive therapy, such as treatment selection/bioselection or modification of surgery, adjuvant therapy, or definitive treatment. Neoadjuvant ICI trials are summarized in this review. Optimized trial designs and additional research are needed to standardize surrogate outcomes and compare survival to standard treatment. Neoadjuvant therapy can be an effective option for precision head and neck oncology bolstered by the advent of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. However, tools for predicting and assessing treatment response remain limited. Further trials are evaluating adaptive strategies, combinations to increase efficacy, and comparisons to standard approaches.",

    "title": "CD33-D2 isoform characterization for advancement of its therapeutic potential.",
    "abstract": "While CD33 directed immunotherapies have caught significant interest in recent years, the only approved antibody-drug conjugate targeting this antigen for AML is gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which targets the IgV-domain of CD33. Unfortunately, in its current form, these are not effective in a significant proportion of patients due to the presence of a splicing SNP resulting in the loss of IgV-domain. This, however, can be mitigated by targeting the IgC2-domain of CD33; thus, this study aimed to characterize CD33-D2 isoform using the recently developed CD33-D2-targeting antibody HL2541. Genetically engineered AML cell lines expressing CD33 isoforms were tested for antibody-bound internalization and response to GO  HL2541-bound-CD33-D2 is internalized similar to CD33-FL upon binding the antibody component of GO. Co-existence of both isoforms compromises the internalization by\u2009>2.5-3-fold for each isoform in the AML cell lines, further resulting in 7-9.5-fold higher IC The results establish the relevance of targeting IgC domain as an alternative immunotarget to supplement AML chemotherapy. CD33 is a protein found on most cancer cells in people with a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A current treatment called gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) targets this protein. GO is made of an antibody that carries a drug to kill cancer cells. When GO sticks to CD33, the protein pulls it inside the cell, which leads to the cell being killed. But for many patients, this does not work well. That is because they have a change in their genes that removes the part of CD33 that GO targets. To solve this problem, we tested a new antibody called HL2541. This new antibody sticks to a different part of CD33. We wanted to see if HL2541 could still attach to and enter AML cells that do not have the part of CD33 targeted by GO. In lab tests, we saw that HL2541 could get inside these cancer cells, just like GO. We also tested it in mice and found that HL2541 could find the cancer cells in the body. These results show that HL2541 can find and enter AML cells with the changed CD33 protein. This means HL2541 might help make a new treatment for patients who do not respond to GO.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a major cause of mortality among central nervous system tumors, with a generally poor prognosis. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family, a group of copper-dependent amine oxidases, has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, but its specific role in glioma and its relationship with immune infiltration remains insufficiently explored. This study aims to investigate the LOX family's expression, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration dynamics in glioma to identify potential therapeutic targets. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using public databases to assess gene expression, mutation frequency, and immune infiltration patterns related to the LOX family in glioma. The results were validated through survival analysis and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays, including EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry, were used to evaluate glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Co-culture experiments with immune cells, ELISA, and a glioma transplantation model were employed to study the immune-modulatory effects of the LOX family. Gene and protein expression levels were further analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The LOX family was significantly upregulated in low-grade gliomas and strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although mutation frequencies were low, the LOX family contributed to glioma progression through pathways involving metastasis, hypoxia response, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration. LOX expression correlated with increased infiltration of macrophages and eosinophils and decreased presence of Treg and CD8+ T cells. Knockdown of LOX genes impaired glioma cell functions, induced apoptosis, and altered immune cell behavior by reducing M2 macrophage polarization and enhancing CD8+ T cell activity. The LOX family is overexpressed in glioma and is associated with poor prognosis and altered immune infiltration patterns. These findings highlight the LOX family as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target, particularly for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

Presentation of meaningful tissue-based molecular pathological diagnostics and discussion of the clinical application of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from liquid biopsies in colorectal cancer. Evaluation of existing literature and congress publications, discussion of post\u00a0hoc analyses of clinical studies and expert recommendations. In Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages\u00a0II/III, the tissue-based evaluation of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) contributes to individual therapy optimization through advice on adjuvant chemotherapy (colon cancer, UICC\u00a0II) or, if necessary, individual neo-adjuvant therapy concepts via the use of immunotherapy (colon, rectal cancer, UICC\u00a0II/III). From liquid biopsies, ctDNA was associated with minimal residual disease, which influences disease-free survival. In the metastatic stage (UICC\u00a0IV), tissue-based determination of RAS and BRAF V600E mutations, MSI\u2011H and in the near future also HER2/neu overexpression should be performed. Broader molecular diagnostics to optimize first-line therapy (molecular hyperselection) shows little additional benefit. ctDNA can be used for longitudinal monitoring of clonal tumor evolution or as an alternative to invasive diagnostics in patients. Molecular pathological diagnostics from tissue and blood complement each other and should be used in a\u00a0targeted and meaningful way according to the underlying question.

    "abstract": "CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a potential treatment for relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The combination of targeted therapeutic strategies, particularly bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor zanubrutinib and programmed death-1 inhibitor tislelizumab, may improve clinical outcomes and modulate the tumour microenvironment (TME). We studied patients with R/R LBCL who received response-adapted zanubrutinib plus tislelizumab upon CD19 CAR T-cell therapy between June 2021 and March 2023. Patients were treated with zanubrutinib daily from leukapheresis to day 28 post-infusion; those achieving complete response continued zanubrutinib monotherapy for 3 months, while partial responders received combined zanubrutinib for 3 months and tislelizumab for up to 2 years. We evaluated the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed on available tumour samples to analyse genetic aberrations and TME characteristics. A total of 54 patients with LBCL were included, with a median follow-up of 23.6 months. The ORR at day 28, month 3, and month 6 were 94% (CRR 66%), 87% (CRR 80%), and 80% (CRR 76%), respectively. The 2-year PFS and 2-year OS rates were 68% and 76%, respectively. Median PFS and median OS were not reached. Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 9% of patients, with no grade \u2265 3 neurotoxicity observed. Genomic and transcriptomic data indicated that this regimen was effective across genetic subtypes and abrogated T-cell exhaustion within the TME. However, tumour-infiltrating M2 macrophages with dysregulated lipid metabolism were associated with poor clinical outcome. Response-adapted zanubrutinib and tislelizumab potentially enhances the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy with a favourable safety profile in R/R LBCL, effectively counteracting T-cell exhaustion. Future studies should focus on targeting M2 macrophages by reprogramming lipid metabolism to further attenuate the immunosuppressive TME. Response-adapted zanubrutinib plus tislelizumab potentially enhances the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy for R/R LBCL with acceptable safety profile. This regimen functions independently of genetic subtypes, rendering it more applicable for clinical practice with CAR T-cell therapy. This regimen effectively abrogates T-cell exhaustion, but fails to overcome the immunosuppressive effects of M2 macrophages, providing a rationale for remodelling TME to optimise CAR T-cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the global scenario of public health, cervical cancer poses a major threat with high mortality rates, especially in women. New incidence cases and prevalence vary across different regions, as recently shown by GLOBOCAN data. The development of cervical cancer is primarily due to persistent infection by high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a multifaceted process that is influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.PurposeThe goal of this study is to thoroughly investigate cervical cancer, including its etiology, molecular mechanisms, progression, diagnosis strategies, and current therapies. This review further highlights the transformative power of HPV vaccination and screening programs in curbing the disease's burden and potentially promising novel approaches like immunotherapy and targeted therapy.Research DesignThis is a narrative review article that summarizes previous literatures regarding cervical cancer in terms of molecular mechanism, etiology, clinical developments, and prevention.Study SampleThe review encompassed studies from diverse sources, including experimental, observational, and clinical research published between 1992 and 2025.Data Collection and/or AnalysisData were collected through comprehensive literature searches using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsNonetheless, there are gaps in research and controversies regarding vaccine coverage, screening practices, and treatment accessibility for poor populations. Precision medicine trends are emerging along with new biomarkers for early detection and personalized treatment, which also form part of this discussion. Key findings include the critical role of prevention measures in controlling the global impact of cervical cancer.ConclusionsThe paper synthesizes the existing knowledge and identifies gaps that require further research, which is significant in augmenting prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer towards addressing its public health implications worldwide. This review addresses the critical global health challenge of cervical cancer, emphasizing its molecular mechanisms, epidemiology, and innovative therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "CAR T-cells therapy is seen as one of the most promising immunotherapies for leukemias, since targeting CD19 has revolutionized the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children, adolescents, and young adults. Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has transformed malignancy treatment, but the tumor microenvironment (TME) presents significant obstacles. PD-1 blockade therapy, while widely used, faces issues such as resistance, adverse events, and limited predictive biomarkers. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to enhance their efficacy and safety. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), often exhibiting an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, contribute to poor prognoses and treatment resistance. Targeting TAMs to repolarize them to a pro-inflammatory M1 state can alleviate immunosuppression and enhance T cell-mediated antitumor responses. TMP195, a class IIa histone deacetylase inhibitor, has shown potential in reprogramming TAMs and synergizing with anti-PD-1 antibodies, although clinical application challenges exist. This study aimed to enhance the PD-1 blockade immunotherapy effectiveness by activating tumor-killing macrophages and T cells using biomimetic nanomedicines. A novel macrophage cell membrane-coated PLGA nanoparticle loaded with small molecule inhibitor, TMP195 (M1@PLGA-PEG-TMP195), was designed, prepared, and characterized. This macrophage membrane-coated PLGA nanoparticle delivery system had good drug loading and cancer cell targeting ability. This approach repolarized TAMs to M1 phenotypes and, combined with PD-1 inhibitors, achieved synergistic cancer treatment effects, improving therapeutic efficacy and inhibiting breast cancer growth and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 39 (USP39) has been implicated in numerous malignancies, however, its pathogenic mechanisms and impact on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remain incompletely characterized. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, we investigated the diagnostic and prognostic values of USP39 across various cancer types. Additionally, we examined the correlation between USP39 expression and immune-related gene signature, immune cell infiltration pattern, tumor microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutation burden (TMB). This study specifically focused on exploring the clinical relevance and molecular functions of USP39 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), with particularly emphasis on its role in shaping the TIME and modulating responses to immunotherapy. The results demonstrated that evaluated USP39 expression significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage and unfavorable clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types, most notably in PAAD. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that USP39 potentially promotes tumor progression through multiple oncogenic signaling cascades. In vitro experimental validation confirmed that USP39 knockdown inhibited migration and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells while inducing apoptosis. Additionally, we identified significant positive correlations between USP39 expression and immune checkpoint molecules, particularly prominent in PAAD. Furthermore, we observed associations between USP39 expression and TMB in 16 cancer types and MSI in 11 cancer types, suggesting that heightened USP39 expression may enhance responsiveness to immunotherapeutic interventions. Collectively, our findings establish USP39 as a valuable immune-related biomarker with both diagnostic and prognostic utility across multiple cancer types, especially PAAD, underscoring its potential as a promising therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.

Disulfidptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death driven by aberrant disulfide bonds and F-actin collapse, provides insights into cancer progression and treatment. We investigated the correlation network and prognostic values of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in AML. Unsupervised clustering was performed to reveal distinct disulfidptosis-related AML subtypes. We implemented the differential analysis and enrichment analysis to explore the difference of the distinct subtypes in biological processes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox model was used to generate a disulfidptosis-related signature. We employed the ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and scRNA analyses to assess the tumor microenvironment of AML. Moreover, experiments validated the functions of PTPN6 and CSK in OCI-AML2 cells. We identified 10 prognostic DRGs and revealed two disulfidptosis subtypes. DRGs significantly affected immune processes like interferon-gamma response and MHC class II antigen presentation. LASSO algorithm was implemented to established a 6-gene signature (HLA-DRB5, CCDC124, PTPN6, HLA-DMA, CSK, ISG15) that predicted prognosis in two validation cohorts more robustly than other signatures. Disulfidptosis was correlated with tumor microenvironment immune cells, especially monocytes. The two risk subgroups differed significantly in susceptibilities of multiple chemotherapy drugs, indicating disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target. Knockdown of PTPN6 and CSK inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and increased apoptosis. Our study provides insights into DRG prognoses and immunomodulation, establishing a robust 6-gene risk model for predicting AML outcomes that may enhance precision medicine and treatment strategies.",

The relationships between the PD-L1 expression and the clinicopathological parameters of CRC patients were determined using the chi-square test and Spearman's rank correlation. p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to be statistically significant. CRC showed a male: female ratio of 1:1.8, most occurred in the seventh decade and 54.17% were right-sided. Adenocarcinoma NOS accounted for 72.5%. The majority (n\u2009=\u200955, 57.3%) of the patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage. PD-L1 expression was observed in 86.46% of cases, significantly correlating with tumour Size (r\u2009=\u20090.263, p\u2009=\u20090.010*), histologic Grade (r\u2009=\u20090.446, p\u2009=\u20090.000*) and tumour Stage (r\u2009=\u20090.367, p\u2009=\u20090.000*). This study highlighted the high frequency of PD-L1 expression in CRC among black patients, with significant associations to clinicopathologic parameters. The findings suggest the potential benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapies and emphasize the need for enhanced early detection and screening in Nigeria.",

    "title": "LPCAT3 regulates the immune infiltration and prognosis of ccRCC patients by mediating ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress.",
    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for 70% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cases. Although surgery remains the mainstay treatment, renal injury and high metastasis rates after nephrectomy dramatically reduce patient quality of life. Drugs that stimulate the immune system by targeting checkpoint pathways improve overall survival in patients with RCC. Here, we investigated the applicability of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) as a target for immunotherapy. In the present study, high LPCAT3 expression in ccRCC was identified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and validated in two external cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. qRT-PCR was performed to identify the mRNA level of LPCAT3 in tumors and adjacent normal tissues. And immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the protein level of LPCAT3 between two groups of samples. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological processes and pathways related to LPCAT3 expression. Key gene expression and correlation analyses were performed to determine the crosstalk among LPCAT3 expression, ferroptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Subsequently, CIBERSORT was used to analyze the immune infiltration status of patients with high and low LPCAT3 expression. TCGA and GEO data revealed that LPCAT3 expression in ccRCC tumor tissues was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues; moreover, patients with high LPCAT3 expression had better survival outcomes. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry verified the high LPCAT3 expression in tumor tissue. Pathways related to ferroptosis and ERS were upregulated in patients with high LPCAT3 expression. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses revealed that low LPCAT3 levels represent an independent risk factor for ccRCC. LPCAT3 expression was positively correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration levels but negatively correlated with the memory B cell, CD8+ T cell, follicular helper T cell, regulatory T cell, activated natural killer cell, and activated memory CD4+ T cell infiltration levels. LPCAT3was identified as a ccRCC biomarker and may regulate immune infiltration and prognosis in ccRCC by mediating ferroptosis and ERS. Thus, it has potential for exploitation as a prognostic and immune therapeutic target for patients with ccRCC.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer globally. For patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC, immunotherapy represents an important advance in clinical practice as an effective and widely used first-line treatment. However, drug resistance following immunotherapy is an emerging problem and, despite the success of immunotherapy in R/M HNSCC, a proportion of patients will become immunotherapy resistant. The mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance are not yet fully understood and subsequent treatment options are limited. Therefore, there is an unmet need for effective and well tolerated treatments for patients who develop immunotherapy-resistant HNSCC. In this review, we address these challenges by summarizing the current definitions of immunotherapy resistance (primary and acquired resistance) as well as knowledge of the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in R/M HNSCC. We then review available clinical data on treatment strategies, including rechallenge with immunotherapy, chemotherapy\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0cetuximab, other targeted treatments, antibody-drug conjugates, and bispecific antibodies. We also investigate future research directions by reviewing ongoing clinical trials. Our review shows that the optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with R/M HNSCC remains unclear. While many therapies have reported promising preliminary results, prospective clinical trials are required to support their adoption in clinical practice. In particular, it appears that immunotherapy and antibody-drug conjugates have high potential in this setting. Our review also highlights the importance of further investigation of the mechanisms underlying immunotherapy-resistant R/M HNSCC, to inform selection of optimal therapeutic strategies on an individual patient basis and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia promotes M2 polarization of macrophages and the formation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Oleanolic acid (OA) has shown great potential in the treatment of HCC. However, the mechanisms of macrophage M2 polarization in hypoxic tumor TME and the regulating effect of OA is still unclear. To investigate the mechanisms of macrophage M2 polarization induced by hypoxic HCC cells-derived exosomes and examine the efficacy of OA in remedying the immunosuppressive TME and the anti-PD1 therapy potential. Hypoxic and normoxic HCC-derived exosomes (H-Exo and N-Exo) were collected by centrifugation. The microRNAs (miRNA) carried by the exosomes were sequenced and then screened to identify the functional miRNA. THP-1-induced macrophages were treated with exosomes or miRNAs to induce the M2 polarization of macrophages. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to identify the direct target of miR-130b-3p and its downstream molecules. Hepa1-6 hepatoma-bearing mice were subjected to determine the efficacy of OA in regulating the TME and the anti-PD1 therapy potential. H-Exo promotes macrophage M2 polarization, and thereby accelerates the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Exosomal miRNA sequencing and subsequent functional validation showed that miR-130b-3p was the mediator of H-Exo-induced macrophage M2 polarization. PTEN was identified as the target of miR-130b-3p, and downregulation of PTEN by miR-130b-3p led to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling and macrophage M2 polarization. In addition, miR-130b-3p also enhanced the glycolysis. OA suppressed H-Exo and miR-130b-3p-induced macrophage M2 polarization, also inhibited miR-130b-3p-induced glycolysis. In vivo, OA treatment enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody by decreasing the number of M2 macrophages and increasing the number of CD8+ T cells. Our findings uncover a new mechanism of hypoxic HCC cells-induced M2 polarization of macrophages through exosomal miR-130b-3p-PTEN-PI3K-Akt signaling. The combination therapy of OA with anti-PD1 antibody may lead to substantial improvements of the immunotherapy efficacy and expand the beneficiaries.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a highly heterogeneous disease that presents challenges in predicting prognosis and treatment response. Cancer stem cells are key drivers of tumor development, progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. The features and prognostic significance of stemness in bladder cancer need further investigation. We used bladder cancer datasets from the TCGA and GEO databases, based on stemness gene sets from the StemChecker database, to identify stemness subtypes using the consensus clustering algorithm. We calculated the mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) using the OCLR algorithm. We compared the differences in overall survival, genomic characteristics, tumor microenvironment, and treatment response between the stemness subtypes. We constructed the stemness subtype classifier using machine learning algorithms such as LASSO regression, random forest, and multivariate logistic regression. The function of the classifier gene was validated through experiments. We divided bladder cancer patients into two subtypes based on the enrichment scores of stemness gene sets. Patients within subtype 1 have a higher mRNAsi score, a better survival rate, an antitumor microenvironment, and higher sensitivity to immunotherapy, while patients within subtype 2 show higher aneuploidy scores, greater homologous recombination defects, an elevated tumor mutation burden, and increased chemotherapy sensitivity. We constructed a stemness subtype classifier based on six differentially expressed genes between the two subtypes. The classifier demonstrated good performance in predicting prognosis on three additional datasets from the GEO database and two non-muscle invasive bladder cancer datasets. Through tumor sphere formation experiments and western blotting, we found that TNFAIP6, out of the six classifier genes, maintains stemness. TNFAIP6 silencing also facilitated the chemotherapy response of cisplatin, docetaxel, and paclitaxel on bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, decreasing TNFAIP6 expression caused the immune checkpoint gene PD-L1 to downregulate. This study provided valuable insights into the heterogeneity of BLCA stemness, and the stemness subtype classifier may facilitate molecular classification and personalized treatment selection for BLCA patients. Besides, TNFAIP6 may serve as a potential future stemness target guiding bladder cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

To investigate prognostic/predictive biomarker, 29 MITO-END3-EC patients were evaluated at pretreatment (B1) and at the end of CP/CPA treatment (B2) for peripheral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and Tregs. At B2, effector Tregs frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with CPA as compared to CP (p\u2009=\u20090.038).

In accordance, both treatments induced M-MDSCs (+\u20095.34%) in MSS patients as compared to MSI-high patients (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Moreover, in a subgroup of patients, primary tumors were highly infiltrated by M-MDSCs in MSS as compared to MSI-high ECs. A post hoc analysis displayed higher frequency of M-MDSCs (p\u2009=\u20090.020) and lower frequency of CD4+ (p\u2009<\u20090.005) at pretreatment in EC patients as compared to healthy donors.

    "abstract": "Dendritic cell (DC)-derived extracellular vesicles (DEVs) are promising candidates for cancer vaccines, but their therapeutic effects still need further optimization. In this study, we utilized neoantigens, lipopolysaccharide and IFN-\u03b3 to induce the maturation of DCs, and then isolated DEVs derived from these mature DCs. We showed that the immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4 antibody, aCTLA-4) can improve the immunostimulatory function of DEVs by directly activating T cells through immune checkpoint signal blockade. The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12), as one of the third signals for T cell activation, can also enhance the capability of DEVs to activate T cells directly. Based on these findings, we designed the engineered DEVs conjugated with IL-12 and aCTLA-4 (DEV@IL-12-aCTLA-4) to improve the therapeutic potential of DEVs by providing sufficient immune regulatory signals. Moreover, the carrier property of DEVs also contributes to the delivery of IL-12 and aCTLA-4 to lymph nodes. This indicates that the conjugation of DEVs with IL-12 and aCTLA-4 constitutes a complementary approach, where IL-12 and aCTLA-4 help to enhance the T cell activation effect of DEVs, and DEVs facilitate the delivery of IL-12 and aCTLA-4. Our results showed that DEV@IL-12-aCTLA-4 can enhance the Th1 immune response and reverse exhausted CD8",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a significant global health challenge, particularly in advanced stages where treatment options are severely constrained. Immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking advancement in cancer treatment, exhibiting promising therapeutic effects in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. However, the efficacy of immunotherapy is not universally applicable to all individuals. Revealing precise biomarkers for tumor immunotherapy as targets or indicators for detection and evaluation can facilitate the resolution of this predicament. This study aims to identify serum tumor markers and blood cell ratios as predictive biomarkers to aid in the selection of gastric cancer patients who may benefit from PD-1 inhibitors therapy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records and hematological data of 98 patients with HER2-negative and microsatellite-stable (MSS) metastatic gastric cancer who received first-line treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy at our institution. We investigated peripheral blood parameters, including Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), C-Reactive Protein-to-Albumin Ratio (CAR), AFP, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), and Sugar antigens 199 (CA199). Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were employed to assess the correlation of these parameters with treatment response and survival duration. The relationship between these indicators and overall survival was assessed by employing Kaplan-Meier survival curves, in conjunction with an analysis of Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), and safety profiles.. Higher pre-treatment levels of NLR, CAR, AFP, and CA199, along with subsequent reductions in NLR, CAR, and CA199 at 12\u00a0weeks post-treatment, were significantly associated with extended PFS and OS. Multivariate Cox analysis suggested that pre-treatment levels of AFP, as well as the reduction in NLR and CA199 at 12\u00a0weeks post-treatment, were strongly correlated with PFS and OS in patients with gastric cancer undergoing immunotherapy. Additionally, the reduction in NLR, CAR, and CA199 observed at 12\u00a0weeks after treatment showed a significant positive correlation with improved DCR and ORR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the decline in NLR and CA199 levels at 12\u00a0weeks post-treatment might be associated with DCR, while pre-treatment CAR levels and the decrease in CAR after 12\u00a0weeks could potentially predict ORR in immunotherapy for gastric cancer. Notably, patients with normal AFP levels exhibited significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 6.8\u00a0months and median overall survival (mOS) of 13.2\u00a0months compared to those with elevated AFP levels (mPFS: 5.2\u00a0months; mOS: 9.4\u00a0months), and this difference was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05).",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is used extensively in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Nevertheless, in contrast to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the endeavors to develop effective targeted treatments for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) have not yielded positive outcomes. Hence, it is crucial to discover biomarkers for immunotherapy and investigate more potent treatments, which is an immediate requirement for individuals with LUSC. The LUSC somatic mutation data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. Multivariate analysis was performed to create a signature related to tumor mutation burden (TMB). Next, we utilized the CIBERSORT algorithm to assess the correlation between TMB and immune infiltrates. Additionally, we identified prognostic immune cells of LUSC through Kaplan-Meier analysis. The TCGA and ICGC cohorts covered a combined total of 11 genes that were frequently mutated. SYNE1 and TTN mutation correlated with an increased TMB and suggested a positive clinical outlook. A TMB-related signature (SYNE1 and TTN) was constructed based on this. The outlook for the high-risk group in LUSC was considerably poorer than the low-risk group (p\u2009=\u20090.004). In LUSC, there was a correlation between the TMB-related signature and immune infiltrates, and a positive response to anti-PD-L1 therapy was observed in individuals with low-risk scores. Furthermore, based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, plasma cells were identified as predictive immune cells in LUSC samples. In conclusion, the GSEA examination demonstrated that the TMB-associated signature stimulated immune system-related signaling pathways. To sum up, the TMB-associated signature could be marker to anticipate the immune reaction in individuals with LUSC.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death process that results in decreased tumor growth and aggressiveness when targeted in various cancer cells. Studying the impact of ferroptosis in glioblastoma (GBM) will provide important knowledge about tumor biology and potential treatment strategies. The high metabolic activity resulting in ROS production, iron content and active lipid metabolism of glioblastoma cells make them particularly susceptible to ferroptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the molecular signature of GBM and its tumor microenvironment, introducing ferroptosis-related biomarkers pathways and drug resistance mechanisms to enhance treatment outcomes for GBM patients. The relationship between ferroptosis and the immune landscape in GBM is complex and can have either positive or negative effects. These effects can be identified through single-cell RNA sequencing to develop targeted chemo-, radio- and immuno- therapies against glioma stem cells and tumor-supportive immune cells. Additionally, the implication of oncolytic virotherapy in combination with ferroptosis induction can lead to improved treatment of GBM in a clinical setting.",

    "title": "Transformative potential of plant-based nanoparticles in cancer diagnosis and treatment: bridging traditional medicine and modern therapy.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is a primary global health concern, with an estimated 35.3 million cancer cases expected worldwide, representing a 76.6% increase in 2022, and 20 million by 2050, resulting from genetic mutation and environmental factors that cause uncontrolled cell growth. Other factors including smoking, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to carcinogens, UV radiation, and aging increase DNA damage. Current cancer treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery are effective, but those have significant effects like lack of specificity, development of drug resistance, and significant side effects to healthy tissues. An advancement to conventional therapies is plant-based nanoparticles as transformative approaches in cancer diagnosis and treatment. These nanoparticles synthesized using plant bioactive compounds like flavonoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, and some metals-oxides like gold, silver, copper, zinc, etc. offer eco-friendly, cost-effective, and biocompatible alternatives. They enhance targeted drug delivery, allowing anticancer agents specifically to tumor cells, minimizing damage to health. Improves imaging techniques like MRI and fluorescence imaging, and helps early detection, cancer biomarkers, allowing for prompt intervention. Recent findings show that nanocarriers made from plant-based materials, such as polyphenols (curcumin, resveratrol) and plant-extracted metal nanoparticles (gold, silver), can improve drug stability and selectively target tumor cells. Plant-derived nanoparticles play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy and nanovaccines. Biodegradable plant-based nanocarriers can deliver cancer vaccines, stimulating long-term immunity against tumors. Graphene oxide and gold nanoparticles synthesized from plant extracts can absorb near-infrared (NIR) light, generating heat to destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. This study discusses the types of plant-based nanoparticles like plant virus nanoparticles (TMV, PVX, CPMV), plant metallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag., Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, and Mn), and flavonoid nanoparticles found in cancer treatment, their significant roles, chemotherapy-based nanomedicines available in the medical field, and a detailed vision of nanomaterial applications in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and targeted drug delivery.",

Recently, immunotherapy gives a survival advantage compared to chemotherapy, but limited to the non-epithelioid histotype, the rarest type. Radical hemithorax radiotherapy (RHRT) improves the Overall Survival (OS) of MPM patients, irrespective of histotype, and is able to induce immunomodulatory effects. In this study we aim to investigate changes in circulating T lymphocytes phenotype and activity, in MPM patients undergoing RHRT, to evaluate a possible therapeutic space for immunotherapy in this setting. To assess immunomodulatory effects of RHRT we evaluate peripheral blood samples of 35 MPM patients collected before treatment, at the end of RT, and 1 month later. We first notice that higher Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) levels, before RT, are associated with an improved OS. The immune monitoring performed by ELISA assays reveals a significant increase in the serum levels of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) and IFN-\u03b3 at the end of RHRT. Furthermore, the percentage of PD-1",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer of the uterine corpus (ECUC) is a common malignancy among females. Disulfidptosis, a recently identified form of cellular death, is characterized by elevated SLC7A11 expression and limited glucose availability, making it a potential cancer treatment target. In this research, clinical data and transcriptome information from EC samples were accessed from the TCGA database. A disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs(DRLs) prognostic signature was developed by univariate/LASSO/multivariate regression analyses. Cellular pathways were identified through GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses. Immune infiltration as well as tumor mutational burden (TMB) were evaluated. The TIDE algorithm and the GDSC database were utilized to predict how patients reacted to immunotherapy as well as anticancer drugs. Finally, the expressions of disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs were measured using RT-qPCR. Results: In this study, we identified 524 disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs and developed a prognostic signature consisting of five DRLs (AC022960.1, PRDX6-AS1, EMSLR, AL359715.3, AC103563.9). Our prognostic signature effectively stratified EC patients into high- and low-risk groups. Compared with the high-risk group, patients in the low-risk group exhibited better overall survival (OS). Additionally, ROC curves and concordance index (C-index) plots were used to assess the accuracy of our prognostic signature. The results demonstrated that the AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 0.676, 0.712, and 0.722, respectively, indicating high predictive accuracy. Further analysis revealed significant differences between high- and low-risk groups in terms of TMB, drug sensitivity, and immune cell infiltration. PCR results showed that PRDX6-AS1, EMSLR, AL359715.3, and AC103563.9 were upregulated in EC cells, whereas AC022960.1 was downregulated. In conclusion, we developed a DRLs signature capable of predicting the TMB, prognosis, and immunological cell infiltration patterns, as well as the reactions to immunotherapy in EC patients.",

Nonetheless, reliable efficacy biomarkers of ICI plus chemotherapy are lacking. In this research, we sought to explore efficacy biomarkers and construct robust prognostic models in NSCLC patients treated with ICI plus chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed 171 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI plus chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics and peripheral blood inflammatory indexes were collected and prognostic models were constructed to explore efficacy and prognosis biomarkers of ICI plus chemotherapy. In the cohort that received first-line ICI plus chemotherapy, pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)\u2009>\u20093.3 and fibrinogen (FIB)\u2009>\u20093.196 were associated with worse efficacy and were independent risk factors of progression-free survival (PFS). Compared to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the derived NLR-FIB (NF) score had significantly improved accuracy in predicting efficacy and prognosis. In advanced NSCLC patients with targetable oncogenic driver alterations receiving second- or post-line ICI plus chemotherapy, pre-treatment NLR\u2009>\u20093.53 was associated with worse efficacy and was an independent risk factor of PFS and OS; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-PFS\u2009>\u200912 months were independent risk factors of overall survival (OS). Secondary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-T790M mutation, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)\u2009>\u2009196.81 and albumin (ALB)\u2009<\u200940.25 were associated with worse PFS. Based on NLR and TKI-PFS, an NLR-TKI-PFS (NTP) score was constructed with three OS risk prognosis categories: favorable, intermediate, and poor (corresponding to a median OS of 21, 12, and 5.3 months). The noninvasive NF score, combining NLR\u2009>\u20093.3 and FIB\u2009>\u20093.196, was superior to PD-L1 estimated from tumor tissue in predicting the efficacy and prognosis of first-line ICI plus chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. The noninvasive NTP score, combining NLR\u2009>\u20093.53 and TKI-PFS\u2009>\u200912 months, is a valuable tool for predicting OS and PFS in advanced NSCLC patients with targetable oncogenic driver alterations receiving second- or post-line ICI combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant treatment has become standard for patients with high-risk operable stage III melanoma, but the optimal regimen is unknown. Targeted therapy approaches yield high pathological response rates, while immunotherapy regimens show favorable recurrence-free survival (RFS). NeoACTIVATE was designed to address whether a neoadjuvant combination of both targeted therapy and immunotherapy might leverage the benefits of each. We tested neoadjuvant treatment with 12 weeks of vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab for patients with BRAF-mutated (BRAFm) melanoma (cohort A) and cobimetinib and atezolizumab for patients with BRAF-wild-type (BRAFwt) melanoma (cohort B), regimens which we have shown generate a substantial major pathological response. After therapeutic lymph node dissection, patients received 24 weeks of adjuvant atezolizumab. Here, we report survival outcomes and their association with biomarkers assayed among the gut microbiome and peripheral blood immune subsets. With 49 months median follow-up, the median RFS was not reached for cohort A and was 40.8 months for cohort B. At 24 months after operation, 2 of 14 cohort A patients and 4 of 13 cohort B patients had experienced distant relapse. Key findings from correlative analyses included diversity, taxonomic and functional metagenomic gut microbiome signals associated with distant metastasis-free survival at 2 years. Notably, we observed a strong correlation between low microbial arginine biosynthesis (required for T-cell activation and effector function) and early distant recurrence (p=0.0005), which correlated with taxonomic differential abundance findings. Peripheral blood immune monitoring revealed increased double-positive (CD4+CD8+) T cells in patients with early recurrence. Neoadjuvant treatment with cobimetinib and atezolizumab\u00b1vemurafenib was associated with a low rate of distant metastasis in patients with high-risk stage III melanoma. Freedom from early distant metastasis was highly associated with taxonomic differences in gut microbiome structure and with functional pathway alterations known to modulate T cell immunity. Identification of predictive biomarkers will permit optimization of neoadjuvant therapy regimens for individual patients. NCT03554083.",

    "abstract": "Steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as a significant subtype of HCC. Understanding the complex tumor microenvironment in HCC is particularly important for stratifying patients and improving treatment response. In this study, we performed proteomic analysis on clinical samples of steatotic HCC and identified human-specific gene alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C) as a key factor. ADH1C is a favorable prognostic factor in both steatotic and non-steatotic HCC. ADH1C promotes fatty acid degradation through a novel non-enzymatic function, inhibiting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Specifically, in vitro experiments revealed that ADH1C interacts with splicing factor retinitis pigmentosa 9 (RP9) to enhance the splicing of key transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa) pre-mRNA, which is crucial for fatty acid degradation. The regulation of the ADH1C/RP9/PPARa axis was supported by in vivo experiments and clinical relevance. This leads to a reduction in the critical metabolite palmitic acid, subsequently decreasing the palmitoylation levels of oncogenic protein TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1), thereby regulating the hippo pathway and subsequent cell proliferation inhibition. Additionally, we found that ADH1C and PPARa can serve as combined biomarkers to distinguish between patients with steatotic and non-steatotic HCC. Combination therapy targeting ADH1C and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) enhances the response of steatotic HCC to anti- PD1 immunotherapy. Our study revealed a central role of ADH1C/PPARa in lipid metabolism and HCC suppression. Targeting lipid metabolism via ADH1C/PPARa may provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of liver cancer.",

However, despite the expanding arsenal of treatment modalities, some patients still face challenges associated with drug resistance, which hinders efforts to improve survival rates. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules with a stable structure and a unique ability to form reverse splicing loops. Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal expression of circRNAs is significantly correlated with the occurrence of genitourinay cancers, indicating their potentials as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new targets for treatment. Although research on circRNAs in genitourinary cancers has progressed, it is still in the preliminary stage. This review summarizes the properties and functions of circRNAs, focusing on their molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in mediating cancer-related drug resistance in the genitourinary system, including autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and glycolysis, etc. The clinical potential of circRNAs in regulating drug resistance is also carefully discussed.",

    "abstract": "T cells are crucial regulators in cancer treatment due to their cytotoxic ability. Recently, immunotherapies based on bispecific antibodies (Bi-Ab) have achieved remarkable effects in cancer treatment, attributed to their capability of recruiting and activating T cells to kill tumors. In the present study, we investigated whether CD155 is an effective target for T-cell-mediated immunotherapy against human gynecological malignancies. We demonstrated that CD155 is expressed on common gynecological tumor cells, including cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers. Next, we evaluated the specific cytotoxic activity of T cells armed with CD155Bi-Ab (CD155Bi-T cells) against tumor cells. Compared with control T cells treated with separate anti-CD155 and anti-CD3 mAbs, CD155Bi-T cells exhibited significant cytotoxicity against CD155-positive gynecological tumor cells. Specifically, in the luciferase assay, the cytotoxicity of CD155Bi-T cells was 2.67-fold higher than that of control T cells at an effector/target ratio of 5:1, indicating a significant enhancement in tumor-killing activity. This enhanced cytotoxic activity was further supported by increased expression of activation markers (CD69 and 4\u2009- 1BB), higher production of T-cell-derived cytokines (IL- 2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1), and elevated levels of the cell-killing mediators (perforin and granzyme B). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CD155 is a promising target for gynecological tumors, and CD155Bi-T cells hold significant potential for immunotherapy against CD155",

    "abstract": "Responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) differ significantly between uveal melanoma (UM) and cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients. We investigated the immune profile of metastatic UM(mUM) patients and identified markers that are predictive of improved survival. Metastatic liver samples from 189 UM patients and 48 CM patients were analyzed at genomic and transcriptional levels, and survival analysis was performed on a subgroup of 76 ICI-treated mUM patients. UM liver metastases seem to preserve the genomic and immune characteristics of primary UM (pUM), with a low prevalence of ICI markers and high mutation rates of GNA11, GNAQ, BAP1, and SF3B. Compared with mCM, UM liver metastasis showed lower infiltration of several immune cells, but a greater proportion of M2 macrophages. Compared with UM liver metastases, CM liver metastases showed higher expression of G2M checkpoint and EF2 target genes. Among the mUM and mCM samples, expression of G2M and E2F pathway genes was highest in tumors with high TMB values and T-cell inflamed scores. A longer median overall survival (OS) was observed in mUM patients with higher expression of LAG3, HLA class I, or HLA class II; which may represent a small proportion of immune hot tumors. Expression patterns of G2M checkpoint and E2F targets suggest a possible contribution to immunotherapy response.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive tumor with high metastatic potential which leads to decreased survival rate and resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Nearly 90% of pancreatic cancer comprises pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). About 80% of diagnoses takes place at the advanced metastatic stage when it is unresectable, which renders chemotherapy regimens ineffective. There is also a dearth of specific biomarkers for early-stage detection. Advances in next generation sequencing and single cell profiling have identified molecular alterations and signatures that play a role in PDAC progression and subtype plasticity. Most chemotherapy regimens have shown only modest survival benefits, and therefore, translational approaches for immunotherapies and combination therapies are urgently required. In this review, we have examined the immunosuppressive and dense stromal network of tumor immune microenvironment with various metabolic and transcriptional changes that underlie the pro-tumorigenic properties in PDAC in terms of phenotypic heterogeneity, plasticity and subtype co-existence. Moreover, the stromal heterogeneity as well as genetic and epigenetic changes that impact PDAC development is discussed. We also review the PDAC interaction with sequestered cellular and humoral components present in the tumor immune microenvironment that modify the outcome of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Finally, we discuss different therapeutic interventions targeting the tumor immune microenvironment aimed at better prognosis and improved survival in PDAC.",

Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between clinical information and EXOSC5 expression in LUAD patients. EXOSC5 expression was validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting, and its functional role was investigated through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and in vitro experiments. EXOSC5 was significantly upregulated in LUAD and associated with poor prognosis. The risk model based on EXOSC5 expression outperformed the traditional staging system for prognosis prediction. EXOSC5 promoted tumor progression by regulating the cell cycle, proliferation, and immune cell infiltration. High EXOSC5 expression was correlated with resistance to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. EXOSC5 is a novel oncogenic factor in LUAD that promotes tumor progression and immune evasion and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

Through colocalization, Mendelian Randomization, and various filtering analyses, we identified four genes (IQGAP1, KRTCAP2, PARP1, MLF2) and four proteins (EGFL9 [DLK2], ECM1, PDIA5, TIMP4) as potential GC biomarkers. These were selected based on significant genetic colocation probabilities and significant associations with GC. Seven of these biomarkers demonstrated predictive capability for GC occurrence, with AUC ranging from 0.61 to 0.99. Drug prediction analysis identified seven protein biomarkers as potential targets for immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and tumor chemotherapy.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia plays a crucial role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) proliferation and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the hypoxic microenvironment and immune resistance remain unclear. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 15 LUAD patients were used to evaluate the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). We identified new subtypes associated with advanced LUAD, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and myeloid cells. Furthermore, we found that the cell subtype module 3 (AGER, TIMP3) of epithelial cells exhibited higher hypoxia scores in advanced LUAD. Meanwhile, we also observed that RSG5\u00a0+\u00a0fibroblast, AOPE+macrophage, S100B\u00a0+\u00a0macrophage, CCL17\u00a0+\u00a0macrophage, and HLA-DRB5\u00a0+\u00a0macrophage cells exhibited higher hypoxia scores in advanced LUAD patients. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that with the gradual decrease of hypoxia score, the cell type score also gradually decreased. Cell communication analysis identified critical receptor-ligand pairs, which were associated with the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Finally, we developed a novel prognostic signature based on hypoxia-related molecular clusters, which possessed predictive power for both prognosis and immunotherapy response. The experimental results confirmed that hypoxia-related genes play a significant role in driving LUAD progression. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for LUAD.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive diagnostic monitoring techniques have become essential for treating lung cancer (LC), which continues to be the primary cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The new diagnostic biomarkers called tumour-educated platelets (TEPs) show strong prospects for providing vital information about tumor biology, tumor spread pathways, and treatment reaction patterns. Despite lacking a nucleus, platelets exhibit an active RNA profile that develops through interactions with tumor-derived compounds and the tumor microenvironments (TME). This review explains platelet-tumour interaction regulatory mechanisms while focusing on platelet contributions toward cancer development, immune system avoidance, and blood clot formation. The detection and classification of LC show promise through the analysis of RNA molecules extracted from platelets that encompass mRNAs and non-coding RNAs. RNA sequencing technology based on TEP demonstrates excellent diagnostic power by correctly identifying LC patients alongside their oncogenic alterations of EGFR, KRAS, and ALK. Treatment predictions have proven successful using platelet RNA profiles, specifically in immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Integrating next-generation sequencing with machine learning and artificial intelligence enhances TEP-based diagnostic tools, improving detection accuracy. Standardizing platelet extraction methods and vesicle purification from tumor material needs better development for effective and affordable clinical use. Future investigations should combine TEPs with circulating tumor DNA and exosomal RNA markers to enhance both earliest-stage LC diagnosis and patient-specific therapeutic approaches. TEPs introduce a groundbreaking technique in oncology since they can transform non-invasive medical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring for cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive malignancy with limited methods for early detection, necessitating the development of reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and management. However, conventional tumor markers, such as CA19-9 and CEA, exhibit insufficient diagnostic accuracy. Recent advancements in molecular genetics have identified several actionable mutations in CCA, enabling molecularly targeted therapies that improve survival in patients harboring these genetic alterations. Cancer panels, which facilitate multiplex genetic profiling, are critical for identifying these mutations. Studies indicate that several actionable mutations are detected in CCA cases, with patients receiving mutation-guided therapies achieving markedly better outcomes. Liquid biopsies, including cell-free DNA and circulating tumor DNA, offer real-time, non-invasive approaches to monitoring tumor dynamics, heterogeneity, and treatment responses. Furthermore, numerous studies have identified non-coding RNAs in serum and bile as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of CCA. On the other hand, immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has shown efficacy in subsets of CCA patients. However, the success of these therapies is often affected by the status of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), underscoring the need for comprehensive TME analysis to predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite these advances, no single biomarker currently demonstrates sufficient sensitivity or specificity for clinical application. The integration of multi-omics approaches with cutting-edge technologies holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, optimizing treatment stratification, and advancing precision medicine in CCA. These developments highlight the transformative potential of biomarkers to improve early detection, prognostic assessment, and personalized therapeutic interventions for CCA.",

We will first provide an overview of approved targeted therapies for treating mCRC, which include antiangiogenic therapy, as well as inhibitors of EGFR, BRAFV600E, HER2 inhibitors, and immune checkpoints. Second, we discuss the different mechanisms of primary resistance, including tumor heterogeneity, both as inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity, and mechanisms of secondary resistance which include: driver oncogene alterations, downstream or parallel bypass signaling, presence of co-dominant driver oncogenes, tumor lineage plasticity, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Resistance mechanisms towards the different drug classes targeting mCRC are discussed in detail. Strategies to overcome resistance primarily involve combination of therapies, although this approach is typically linked to increased drug toxicity, manifesting as on and off-target effects. Moreover, the cost and accessibility of targeted therapies pose significant challenges for diverse populations. Addressing these challenges necessitates further research efforts aimed at optimizing the use of targeted therapy in mCRC. Integration of genomic biomarkers, such as sequencing and liquid biopsy, into routine clinical practice holds promise in enhancing treatment outcomes. In conclusion, this comprehensive review underscores the complex challenges encountered in targeted therapy for mCRC.",

Early identification of beneficiaries remains a challenge. This study analyzed baseline transcriptomic data from 24 NSCLC patients (9 major pathological response [MPR], 15 nonmajor pathological response [NMPR]) treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, sourced from the GEO database. Molecular analyses and immune infiltration analyses were performed using pathologic response as an endpoint. After identifying the interferon signaling subset NeoIGS, we analyzed the relationship between NeoIGS and immune scores, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy efficacy. A key gene in NeoIGS was screened by reveiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Subsequently, the expression of the key gene was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 53 NSCLC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Interferon signaling pathway expression and CD8+ T-cell infiltration were higher in the MPR group. NeoIGS predicted pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.926) and also demonstrated predictive value in the ICIs monotherapy cohort. IPS and TIDE scores also confirmed NeoIGS's association with immunotherapy in the TCGA NSCLC dataset. Furthermore, patients with higher NeoIGS scores had more immune cell infiltration and increased expression of ICI\u00a0targets. ROC analysis identified ATF3 as NeoIGS's key gene. In the clinical cohort, ATF3 outperformed PD-L1 in predicting pathologic response, with a 90.0% MPR rate in the high-expression group. We established that a subset of interferon signaling pathways, NeoIGS, is closely associated with immunotherapy. Among them, ATF3 is the most critical gene that accurately predicts pathological remission in neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy.",

This study introduces a multimodal fusion subtyping (MOFS) framework that integrates radiological, pathological, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from 122 patients with IDH-wildtype adult glioma, identifying three subtypes: MOFS1 (proneural) with favorable prognosis, elevated neurodevelopmental activity, and abundant neurocyte infiltration; MOFS2 (proliferative) with the worst prognosis, superior proliferative activity, and genome instability; MOFS3 (TME-rich) with intermediate prognosis, abundant immune and stromal components, and sensitive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. STRAP emerges as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for MOFS2, associated with its proliferative phenotype. Stromal infiltration in MOFS3 serves as a crucial prognostic indicator, allowing for further prognostic stratification. Additionally, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) classifier based on radiological features to further enhance the clinical translatability, providing a non-invasive tool for predicting MOFS subtypes.

A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 1327 sequencing data samples alongside their relevant clinical information sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pertaining to glioblastoma (GBM), low-grade glioma (LGG), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CCGA) and University of California Santa Cruz Xena (UCSC Xena) datasets. These tools were employed for gene expression profiling, survival analysis, and cell communication mapping. Spatial transcriptomics revealed the localization of mesenchymal (MES)-like malignant tumors, and drug sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate responses to quinpirole and meropenem. Additionally, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) framework was utilized to gauge the responsiveness to immunotherapy. The MES-like malignant and monocyte/macrophage (mono/macro) cell subsets showed high hallmark scores, playing key roles in the tumor microenvironment. MES-like malignant marker gene scores correlated with overall survival across datasets, whereas mono/macro marker gene scores were significant in the TCGA-LGG and CCGA datasets. Key interactions between these cell types were found, especially with CD14-ITGB2, LGALS1-CD69, and APOE-TREM2. The mono/macro cell subset demonstrated better immune therapy responsiveness, as indicated by lower TIDE scores. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that MES-like malignant tumors are predominantly localized in four distinct regions, with the marker genes CHI3L1 and ADM confirming these locations. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed differential responses of the MES-like malignant cell subset to quinpirole and meropenem. Our results offer fresh perspectives on the differential roles of MES-like malignant and monocyte/macrophage cell subsets in tumor progression and immune modulation, providing novel insights into glioma biology.",

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common head and neck cancers, and immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has become a treatment option for recurrent OSCC after surgery and radiation therapy. However, few studies have identified definitive biomarkers for predicting patient response to anti-PD1 therapy in OSCC. In the present study, biopsy specimens were obtained from 23 patients with recurrent OSCC who were subsequently treated with anti-PD1 therapy. Immunohistochemical examinations of CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD103, CD163, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), HLA-A/B/C, HLA-DR, and \u03b22 microglobulin were performed, and their correlation with clinical response was statistically analyzed. We found that an increased density of CD8-positive lymphocytes and increased PD-L1 expression predicted a favorable response to anti-PD1 therapy in recurrent OSCC. In contrast, clinical factors such as age and sex, and immune-related factors such as HLA-Classes I and II, were not associated with the response to anti-PD1 therapy. Taken together, our results suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 and PD-L1 may be useful for predicting the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in recurrent OSCC.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B), a G protein-coupled receptor, is implicated in tumor progression and immune regulation in various cancers. However, its specific role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) remains largely unexplored. This study aims to elucidate the expression profile, prognostic value, immune modulatory role, and therapeutic potential of ADORA2B in HNSC. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were performed using TCGA and GEO datasets to evaluate ADORA2B expression, clinical correlations, and prognostic significance in HNSC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to explore ADORA2B-associated pathways. Immune infiltration was assessed via ESTIMATE and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy sensitivity and drug sensitivity were analyzed using the IMvigor210 and NCI-60 databases, respectively. In vitro experiments, including siRNA-mediated ADORA2B knockdown, CCK-8 assays, colony formation, and wound healing assays, were performed to validate the oncogenic role of ADORA2B. ADORA2B was significantly overexpressed in HNSC tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its expression correlated with advanced clinical stage as well as poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Functional enrichment analyses revealed significant downregulation of immune-related pathways in high ADORA2B expression groups. High ADORA2B expression was associated with a more immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by lower immune and stromal scores and reduced immune cell infiltration. Immunotherapy response analysis demonstrated that patients with high ADORA2B expression exhibited poorer outcomes following ICB therapy. Drug sensitivity analysis identified several agents, including Ixazomib citrate, Masitinib, and others, as potential therapeutic candidates for high ADORA2B expression patients. In vitro experiments confirmed that ADORA2B knockdown significantly inhibited HNSC cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, underscoring its critical role in tumor progression. ADORA2B is a key oncogenic driver in HNSC, contributing to tumor proliferation, migration, and an immunosuppressive TME. Its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced immunotherapy efficacy. Targeting ADORA2B may enhance therapeutic outcomes and overcome treatment resistance, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women and exhibits significant heterogeneity. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapy. However, its impact on the prognosis and immunotherapy responses is incompletely understood. Using public databases, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of transcriptome and single-cell sequencing data. After performing immune infiltration analysis, we conducted consensus clustering, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression to identify independent prognostic genes in breast cancer. Subsequently, we developed a prognostic model for patients with breast cancer. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) values were used to assess patient's responsiveness to breast cancer. Based on single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we identified various cell types through cluster analysis and investigated the expression of prognostic model genes in each cell type. The drug sensitivity of targeted therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment was analyzed in different cell types. We identified 12 independent prognostic genes associated with breast cancer and used these genes to construct a prognostic model. The prognostic model accurately discriminated between patients classified as high- and low-risk, providing precise prognostic predictions for individual patients. Additionally, our model exhibited a robust capacity to predict the immunotherapeutic response in breast cancer patients. Our investigation revealed a notable association between the proportion of endothelial cells (ECs) and patient prognosis in breast cancer. A prognostic model for breast cancer was formulated that showed close associations between prognosis and response to immunotherapy. For patients predicted by our model to not respond effectively to immunotherapeutic agents, it may be considered to combine immunotherapeutic agents with targeted therapeutic agents identified through our drug sensitivity analysis, which could potentially enhance treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a prevalent form of cancer that impacts men on a global scale, and its treatment faces challenges such as tumor metastasis, immune resistance, and epigenetic abnormalities. Most current research focuses on nanocarriers with a single function, but the dual mechanism of action-enhancing immune response and regulating EZH2 epigenetic modification-has not been reported. This study is the first to construct an engineered outer membrane vesicle (OMV) delivery system loaded with PD-1 antibody and Curcumol, combining two cutting-edge approaches: tumor immunotherapy and epigenetic regulation. We developed a nanocarrier system based on engineered OMVs (OMV-PD-1) to deliver the natural anticancer compound Curcumol, aiming to regulate epigenetic modifications and enhance tumor immune responses, thereby effectively inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. OMV-PD-1 was prepared using recombinant technology, and its characteristics were identified through the application of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We assessed its antitumor activity against prostate cancer cells (PC3) in vitro and in vivo and explored its molecular mechanisms through RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). An outstanding encapsulation efficiency and a delayed drug release profile were evident in OMV-PD-1/Curcumol. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the system significantly inhibited PC3 cell migration (77.25 % inhibition) and invasion (73.03 % inhibition), and regulated histone methylation modifications (such as H3K9 and H3K27) by downregulating EZH2 gene expression. In vivo experiments confirmed its excellent tumor targeting in a humanized mouse model, significantly inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing immune responses, such as increased NK cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The OMV-PD-1/Curcumol delivery system developed in this study not only hinders the aggressive actions of prostate cancer cells by regulating epigenetic modifications but also significantly stimulates antitumor immune responses, offering a unique and readily implementable therapeutic avenue.",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies in the world. The management of HCC depends on the underlying hepatic function and histological stage of the neoplasm, potentially encompassing locoregional therapies, surgical resection, hepatic transplantation, targeted drug therapies, and immunotherapy. However, the outlook for advanced HCC remains poor, with global 5-year survival rates below 15%. Consequently, it is imperative to identify novel tumor biomarkers for HCC prediction. Multiple public databases were used to analyze PTBP2 expression, potential biological functions, and immune infiltration levels in HCC. In addition, immunohistochemical staining, phenotypic experiments, flow cytometry, and mouse subcutaneous tumors were used to verify the elevated PTBP2 expression and its oncogenic effect in HCC. The expression of PTBP2 is abnormally high in liver cancer and promoted the occurrence and development of HCC. Our study demonstrated that HCC tissues exhibited increased levels of PTBP2 expression compared to normal liver tissues. Elevated PTBP2 expression has been identified as closely linked to low survival in patients with HCC and could be a clinically independent prognostic factor. Additionally, PTBP2 may influence the development and forecasting of patients with HCC by altering the TME. Moreover, we confirmed the association between PTBP2 expression and HCC, both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "LGALS3BP, also referred as Gal-3BP, Mac2-BP, or 90\u00a0K, is a heavily glycosylated, secreted protein prominently localized at the surface of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Its levels are significantly elevated in various types of cancer, including neuroblastoma, and are generally associated with advanced disease and tumor progression. Our previous research has shown that LGALS3BP is an effective target for ravtansine (DM4)-based Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) therapy in multiple preclinical models. We assessed total and extracellular vesicles (EVs)-associated LGALS3BP through ELISA assay in serum of a pseudometastatic neuroblastoma model to evaluate the correlation of LGALS3BP levels with tumor dissemination. We employed a syngeneic neuroblastoma mouse model using murine neuroblastoma NXS2 cells overexpressing human LGALS3BP in order to evaluate immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by anti-LGALS3BP ADC therapy and investigated the nature of the tumor immune infiltrate by cytofluorimetry. Furthermore, we designed a six-arm in vivo experiment to evaluate the efficacy of ADC in combination with an immune check-point inhibitor (ICI) anti-PD-1. Finally, a rechallenge assay was conducted on cured mice to assess the presence of immunological memory. Here, we report that circulating and EVs-associated LGALS3BP levels significantly correlate with neuroblastoma progression and dissemination. Moreover, we show that in the syngeneic NXS2 neuroblastoma model, DM4 treatment induces cell surface expression of ICD markers calreticulin, HSP70, and HSP90, and an increased PD-L1 expression in vitro, followed by enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Notably, the combination therapy of anti-LGALS3BP-targeting ADC with anti-PD-1 results in a higher inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with either agent given alone. Rechallenge assay reveals that mice previously treated and cured with the ADC retain immune memory, suggesting the therapy's ability to induce a durable and protective antitumor immune response. Our findings establish that circulating LGALS3BP is a potential biomarker for liquid biopsy and uncover this protein as a suitable target for therapeutic strategies combining 1959-sss/DM4 ADC with an anti-PD-1 ICI for the treatment of LGALS3BP expressing neuroblastoma.",

A total of 1000 biopsy-proven cancer patients at the HCG cancer center were profiled in an IRB-approved prospective study. The findings were discussed in the multidisciplinary molecular tumor board (MTB), and recommendations were documented in electronic medical records (EMRs) for clinical management and follow-up. A total of 1747 genomic alterations were detected (mean 1.7 mutations/sample), with 80% of patients having genetic alterations with therapeutic and prognostic implications (Tier I-32%, Tier II-50%). CGP revealed a greater number of druggable genes (47%) than did small panels (14%). Tumor-agnostic markers for immunotherapy (IO) were observed in 16% of the current cohort, based on which IO was initiated. In 13.5% of the cohort, alterations in the HRR pathway including sBRCA (5.5%) were detected providing an option for treatment with platinum or PARP inhibitors. Other significant alterations included those in EGFR, KRAS/BRAF, PIK3CA, cKIT, PDGFRA, ARID1A, ARID2, and FGFR. RNA sequencing revealed 55\u2009+\u2009RNA alterations, including those in TMPRSS-ERG, RPS6KB1-VMP1, EML4-ALK, NTRK, PDGFRA and EWSR. Clinical outcome data were available via EMR for 618 patients (62%), out of whom 419 patients had druggable mutations (67%; 95% CI 88.9-93.9%) and 39 patients had 1 or more mutations with prognostic implications. However, only 200 patients (44%; 95% CI 39.1-48.1%) were included in the MTB discussion. Based on genomics reports, the treatment regimen was changed for 137 and 61 patients with and without clinical inputs from the MTB, respectively. The overall change in therapy based on CGP in the clinical cohort was 43%, which was greater in patients enrolled for MTB than in patients who had not undergone MTB. At the interim analysis, with a median follow-up of 18\u00a0months (range 12-24\u00a0months) after the change in therapy as per genomics report, 97 patients (71%) were found to be alive thus establishing the importance of CGP and MTB in personalized genomics-driven treatment.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation cancer immunotherapies aim to improve patient outcomes by combining inhibitory signal blockade with targeted T-cell costimulation in tumor and lymphoid tissues. Acasunlimab (DuoBody-PD-L1\u00d74-1BB) is an investigational, bispecific antibody designed to elicit an antitumor immune response via conditional 4-1BB activation strictly dependent on simultaneous programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) binding. Since 4-1BB is coexpressed with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) on CD8 The effect of acasunlimab and pembrolizumab combination was analyzed in vitro using functional immune cell assays, including mixed-lymphocyte reactions and antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. The antitumor activity of the combination was tested in vivo in (1) MC38, MB49, Pan02, and B16F10 syngeneic tumor models using acasunlimab and anti-PD-1 mouse-surrogate antibodies; and (2) triple knock-in mice expressing the human targets using an acasunlimab chimeric antibody (chi-acasunlimab) and pembrolizumab. The mechanism of action of the combination was investigated in the MC38 syngeneic model through immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA sequencing. The combination reinvigorated dysfunctional T cells in vitro, while also potentiating T-cell expansion, interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon gamma secretion and cytotoxic activity. In vivo, the combination of chi-acasunlimab and pembrolizumab or mouse-surrogate antibodies potentiated antitumor activity and survival in the humanized knock-in and multiple syngeneic mouse models, leading to durable complete tumor regressions in the MC38 model consistent with therapeutic synergy. Mechanistically, the combination enhanced clonal expansion of tumor-specific CD8 These preclinical results demonstrate that conditional 4-1BB stimulation combined with complete PD-1 blockade enhances antitumor immunity through complementary mechanisms. The acasunlimab and pembrolizumab combination is being evaluated in Phase 2 (NCT05117242) and pivotal Phase 3 (NCT06635824) trials in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after checkpoint inhibitor therapy failure.",

The mechanisms underlying the production and profile of EVs during radiotherapy (RT) require addressing radiobiological aspects to determine cellular responses to specific radiation doses and fractionation. In this review, we explore the role of EVs in the 7 Rs of radiobiology, known as the molecular basis of a biological tissue response to radiation, supporting EVs as a shared player in all the seven processes. We also highlight the relevance of EVs in the context of liquid biopsy and resistance to immunotherapy, aiming to establish the connection and utility of EVs as tools in contemporary and precision radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major subtype of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with poor prognosis. Despite advances in molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the five-year survival rate remains low. Disulfidptosis, a novel cell death mechanism, may play a role in tumor progression. CD2AP (CD2-associated protein), a key gene related to Disulfidptosis, is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and signaling. This study aimed to explore CD2AP's function in LUAD and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target through multi-omics analysis. We analyzed CD2AP expression and clinical significance in LUAD using data from TCGA, GEO, and other public databases. We employed transcriptomics, methylation analysis, immune infiltration assays, and spatial transcriptomics. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the relationship between CD2AP expression and prognosis. Enrichment analysis identified biological processes and pathways related to CD2AP, while its association with the immune microenvironment and drug sensitivity was also evaluated. CD2AP was significantly overexpressed in LUAD, and high expression correlated with poorer prognosis, including overall survival and progression-free survival. Enrichment analysis showed CD2AP is involved in cell adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and immune escape, suggesting it promotes LUAD progression through these pathways. High CD2AP expression was associated with alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment and drug sensitivity, particularly to chemotherapeutics like Cisplatin, Etoposide, and Paclitaxel, and resistance to targeted therapies like Gefitinib. Spatial transcriptomics revealed higher CD2AP expression in tumor regions, especially in malignant cell-enriched areas. This study highlights CD2AP's critical role in LUAD, particularly in immune microenvironment modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and drug response. CD2AP's high expression is linked to poor prognosis and may serve as a potential target for immunotherapy and drug response prediction.",

    "abstract": "Human EXO1 is a 5'\u2009\u2192\u20093' exonuclease that plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle checkpoints, maintaining replication forks and participating in post-replication DNA repair pathways. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of EXO1 in cancers such as liver and breast cancer. However, there is a gap in the comprehensive analysis of EXO1 in a wide range of cancers, and its precise role in cancer patient prognosis and immune response remains unclear. This study aims to systematically investigate the potential associations between EXO1, immune infiltration and prognostic value in different cancer types and to gain a deeper understanding of its mechanisms of action.We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the overarching role of EXO1 across various cancers by utilizing multiple databases. Our analysis encompassed scrutinizing EXO1 expression and evaluating its correlation with clinical survival, immune checkpoints, Tumor Stemness Score, Prognostic Value, immunomodulators, genomic profiles, immunological characteristics, immunotherapy, and functional enrichment. EXO1 is expressed in various normal tissues and at significantly higher levels in most tumors compared to non-tumor tissues. High EXO1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers. Genetic mutations and RNA modifications of EXO1 were also investigated, as well as its correlation with tumor immunity and genomic stability. We investigated the potential role of EXO1 in immunotherapy and identified differing drug responses based on EXO1 expression levels in Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM), which holds promise for personalized treatment. Furthermore, we analyzed EXO1-related genes and pathways, revealing its potential involvement in crucial biological processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of EXO1 in cancer initiation and progression, offering valuable insights for personalized cancer therapy and precision medicine. This study highlights the diverse functions of EXO1 in cancer, including its involvement in cancer initiation, prognosis, immune regulation, and response to immunotherapy. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of EXO1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target, as well as its role in determining treatment response in cancer management.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, have shown great success in treating melanoma. PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274), a ligand of PD-1, binds to PD-1 on T cells, inhibiting their activation and proliferation through multiple pathways, thus dampening tumor-reactive T cell activity. Studies have linked PD-L1 expression in melanoma with tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, making the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway a critical target in melanoma therapy. However, immune-related adverse events are common, reducing the effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 treatments. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome significantly influences anti-tumor immunity, with the microbiome potentially reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and overcoming resistance to anti-PD-1 therapies in melanoma patients. This review explores the mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1 in melanoma and examines how gut microbiota and its metabolites may help address resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, offering new insights for improving melanoma treatment strategies.",

Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and quantitative real-time PCR were used to validate the expression level of SLFN11 and drug sensitivity in colorectal cancer samples. Our study revealed that SLFN11 was downregulated in most cancers and correlated with DNA repair, the P53 pathway and immune response in tumor development progress by multi-omics analysis. Dysregulated SLFN11 is accompanied by several immune cell infiltrations and immune-related regulators, which can be a promising screening and prognostic biomarker and chemotherapy predictive target for clinical application.

This retrospective study included 99 melanoma patients in our hospital from June 2017 to July 2023. MC1R expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry assays. Histochemistry score (H-score) determined the level of MC1R immunohistochemistry expression in melanoma. The relationships among MC1R expression, clinical pathological parameters in melanoma patients were assessed using Chi-square and Fisher's precision probability tests. Kaplan-Meier assay and log-rank test were utilized to estimate survival curves. Potential independent factors among the enrolled patients were investigated using COX regression analysis. According to median value of H-score, 38 cases with low MC1R expression and 61 cases with high MC1R expression in melanoma tumor tissues were observed. Patients with high MC1R expression in melanoma tissues exhibited a worse prognosis compared to patients with low MC1R expression. The survival time difference was statistically significant [MC1R expression in melanoma tumor tissue (MC1RT): median DFS, 12.83 vs. 17.53 months, \u03c72 = 5.395, P=0.0202; median OS, 16.47 vs. 21.77 months, \u03c72 = 5.082, P=0.0243. MC1R expression in normal adjacent to melanoma tissue (MC1RN): median DFS, 12.03 vs. 14.29 months, \u03c72 = 6.864, P=0.0088; median OS, 16.73 vs. 21.77 months, \u03c72 = 5.649, P=0.0175]. Multivariate COX regression model analysis indicated that MC1RN, MC1RT, sex, ESR, tumor site, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy were potential prognostic factors for the DFS. Furthermore, MC1RN, MC1RT, sex, tumor site, TLN, PLN, and immunotherapy were potential prognostic factors for the OS. Calibration curve indicated the predicted probabilities of nomogram models were in accordance with the actual probabilities, and the prediction accuracy was relatively high at one year and three years following surgery. The decision clinical curve revealed that the nomogram models had better predictive performance for DFS and OS than the MC1RT or MC1RN thresholds. Low MC1R expression in melanoma tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissue might be beneficial for the prognosis of melanoma patients. MC1R was a predictive factor for the prognosis of melanoma patients. Nomogram models based on MC1R demonstrated good prediction ability.",

    "abstract": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is an essential lipid transfer protein for the synthesis and secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in hepatocytes and chylomicrons (CM) in intestinal cells. Further researches have revealed that MTTP exerted its functions in a variety of tissues beyond the liver and intestine, including the heart, neural tissues and antigen-presenting cells. Dysregulation of MTTP expression can lead to many diseases, such as lipid metabolism disorders, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Despite its importance, research on MTTP in cancer is limited, with no comprehensive pan-cancer studies available. MTTP expression was explored with the TIMER 2.0 and Sangerbox databases. The pathological stages and survival analysis of MTTP were analyzed via GEPIA and Kaplan Meier plotter. The gene mutations of MTTP were analyzed by cBioPortal database. The immune landscape of MTTP in the tumor microenvironment(TME) was analyzed using the TIMER 2.0 and single-cell sequencing. Based on the RNA-seq data in TCGA, we constructed GSEA enrichment analysis for MTTP. We identified the pro-tumor and anti-ferroptosis functions of MTTP in gastric cancer (GC) cells by  MTTP expression was elevated in at least 1/3 tumors. High expression of MTTP was associated with poor prognosis in most tumors. MTTP levels were significantly correlated with three scores (immune, stromal, and extimate) and immune checkpoints in at least half of tumor types. Single cell sequencing of immune cells showed that MTTP was mainly expressed in macrophages, especially in microglia. MTTP increased in GC and MTTP knockdown limited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of GC cells, accompanied by increased sensitivity to ferroptosis. In addition, analyzing the ferroptosis genes associated with MTTP at the single cell level, we found that macrophages may be involved in the ferroptosis process in GC. Our pan-cancer study emphasizes that MTTP is a promising prognostic and immunotherapeutic biomarker in tumors. High expression of MTTP is correlated with the infiltration of diverse immune cells and regulates ferroptosis in GC cells, providing a potential target for tumor immunotherapy.",

This field of research focuses on utilizing the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. One important method is immune checkpoint inhibitors, which enable T cells to recognize and attack tumor cells by releasing the immune system's brakes. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is another approach that modifies a patient's T cells to express receptors specific to tumor-associated antigens. Some cancer vaccines have demonstrated positive results in clinical trials, particularly colorectal and gastric cancers. Despite progress, challenges exist in immunotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers, such as treatment resistance, limited biomarkers for patient selection, and identifying new targets.

In particular, in the treatment of TNBC with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, both monotherapy and combination chemotherapy, as well as targeted drugs and other therapeutic strategies, have broad therapeutic prospects. In addition, these inhibitors can participate in the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) through blocking PD-1/PD-L1 binding, which can improve immune efficacy.

Recognizing the urgent need to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with EC, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee (GCSC) convened a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on January 8th and 9th 2024, \"Refining the Approach to Endometrial Cancer in the Immunotherapy Era.\" Multi-disciplinary experts were charged with addressing critical challenges, to optimize treatment of EC in the new immunotherapy landscape. As part of the CTPM working groups were assembled to address several important aspects of clinical trial design. Working Group 1 (WG1) focused on translational science and was tasked with reviewing the scientific literature for data on validated discriminants of response to immunotherapy to inform trial concept development by the therapy-focused groups. The WG established that molecular subtyping of EC is now the standard approach for classifying endometrial tumors. Molecular subtyping for both prognostic and predictive applications should be considered when assessing biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Additionally, strategies to improve immune response like incorporation of radiation as well as therapy sequencing considerations should continue to be explored. A major key observation from WG1 was lack of validated discriminants for immunotherapy response beyond mismatch repair status and tumor mutational burden and exploration of additional discriminants of response and resistance will be critical with the increasing use of immunotherapy in EC.",

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with ~7% 5-year overall survival reflecting early metastasis and rapid acquired chemoresistance. Immunotherapy briefly extends overall survival in ~15% cases, yet predictive biomarkers are lacking. Targeted therapies are beginning to show promise, with a recently approved delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3)-targeted therapy impacting the treatment landscape. The increased availability of patient-faithful models, accumulating human tumour biobanks and numerous comprehensive molecular profiling studies have collectively facilitated the mapping and understanding of substantial intertumoural and intratumoural heterogeneity. Beyond the\u00a0almost ubiquitous loss of wild-type p53 and RB1, SCLC is characterized by heterogeneously mis-regulated expression of MYC family members, yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), NOTCH pathway signalling, anti-apoptotic BCL2 and epigenetic regulators. Molecular subtypes are based on the\u00a0neurogenic transcription factors achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1) and neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1), the rarer non-neuroendocrine transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3), and immune- and inflammation-related signatures. Furthermore, SCLC shows phenotypic plasticity, including neuroendocrine-to-non-neuroendocrine transition driven by NOTCH signalling, which is associated with disease progression, chemoresistance and immune modulation and, in mouse models, with metastasis. Although these features pose substantial challenges, understanding the molecular vulnerabilities of transcription factor subtypes, the functional relevance of plasticity and cell cooperation offer opportunities for personalized therapies informed by liquid and tissue biomarkers.",

Integrating systemic and local treatments requires a multidisciplinary approach to improve outcomes. This review summarizes recent developments in treatment for mRCC. Upfront immuno-oncology (IO)-based combinations have improved survival, though concerns about overtreatment and toxicity persist. While the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) has declined to some extent, it may still benefit well-selected patients. Metastasis-directed therapies, including metastasectomy and stereotactic radiotherapy, provide prognostic value, particularly for oligometastatic lesions or brain metastases. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) holds promise for personalized treatment but is currently limited by the lack of actionable mutations and predictive biomarkers. A personalized, multimodal approach is essential for optimizing mRCC management. Careful patient selection is key to balancing the benefits of treatment with the risks of toxicity. While CN and metastasis-directed therapies remain useful in select cases, advancing individualized care requires the development of validated biomarkers and broader application of CGP.",

    "abstract": "Advanced biliary tract cancers (ABCs) are a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies of the bile ducts and gall-bladder with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Cisplatin-gemcitabine (CISGEM) chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (durvalumab or pembrolizumab) is the current first-line standard of care (1L-SoC). ABCs frequently harbour actionable molecular alterations that suggest a high potential for benefit from molecular targeted therapies (MTTs). However, the assessment of potential first-line MTT treatments is hindered by the scarcity of ABCs harbouring a specific alteration and the time required to carry out tumour molecular profiling. We detail here the design of SAFIR-ABC10, an international, randomised, phase III umbrella trial comparing the efficacy of sequential matched targeted therapy after four cycles (12 weeks) of 1L-SoC versus continued 1L-SoC in patients with ABC and an actionable molecular alteration [European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) tier I or II]. The primary study endpoint is progression-free survival. Besides initial tumour and circulating DNA next-generation sequencing analysis, sequential blood and tumour sampling will be carried out to identify biomarkers of prognosis, response and acquired resistance. SAFIR-ABC10 is, to our knowledge, the first randomised, umbrella trial assessing the concept of precision medicine in ABC, the ideal setting for addressing this question with a high rate of targetable alterations.",

    "abstract": "Advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is characterized by molecular heterogeneity and distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), in particular, play a critical role in shaping an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We developed a prognostic model by integrating GEO-derived bulk RNA sequencing data and single-cell transcriptome. Model predictions were confirmed through RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens, while in vitro assays (CCK8, transwell invasion, scratch, colony formation, and immunofluorescence) validated the function of SAP18 in cell proliferation, invasion, and ECM remodeling. Expression patterns of the 5 Tregs-associated genes in clinical specimens aligned with model predictions, underscoring the model's robustness. The high-risk subgroup was associated with upregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, an abundance of immune-suppressive cells, higher TP53 mutation rate, and limited benefit from immunotherapy. In contrast, the low-risk subgroup exhibited anti-tumor immunity. Cell-cell communication analysis also implicated the collagen pathway in Tregs-mediated immune evasion in ESCC. Functional assays indicated that SAP18 in the prognostic model significantly promotes proliferation, invasion, and ECM reconstruction, further highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Our findings elucidate the role of Tregs in the TME, underscoring significant potential of SAP18, which is essential for assessing patient prognosis and may facilitate the development of personalized therapies for ESCC.",

    "abstract": "ISG15, an interferon-stimulated ubiquitin-like protein, plays a multifaceted role in tumorigenesis and immune regulation. This study comprehensively evaluates ISG15 as a prognostic biomarker and predictor of immunotherapy response through pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. By integrating multiomics data from TCGA, GEO, and clinical cohorts, we found that ISG15 is significantly overexpressed in multiple cancers and generally correlates with poor prognosis. Elevated ISG15 expression is associated with increased immune checkpoint gene expression, particularly PD-L1, and immune infiltration, notably M2-like tumor-associated macrophages. Immunohistochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence confirmed a strong positive correlation between ISG15, PD-L1, and M2-TAM infiltration in lung and gastric cancer samples. Functional analysis at the single-cell level revealed significant associations between ISG15 and tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune suppression. Immunotherapy cohort analysis demonstrated that tumors with high ISG15 expression responded favorably to PD-L1 inhibitors but exhibited resistance to CTLA-4 blockade, findings further validated in lung cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. These results suggest that ISG15 is a promising biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy response prediction across cancers. Its integration into clinical decision-making may enhance personalized treatment strategies, improve immunotherapy outcomes, and provide new insights into the tumor immune microenvironment, cancer progression, and potential therapeutic targets for future drug development.",

These interventions offer the possibility of reversing or controlling cancer progression, enhancing the efficacy of traditional treatments like chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Despite promising developments, challenges remain in identifying key microbial species and pathways and validating microbiome-targeted therapies through large-scale clinical trials. Nonetheless, the intersection of microbiome research and cancer initiation and development presents an exciting frontier for innovative therapies. This review offers a fresh perspective on cancer initiation and development by integrating microbiome insights, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary research to enhance our understanding of cancer progression and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "SERPINE1 is a serine protease inhibitor upregulated in various malignancies and pivotal in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis and the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study elucidates the mechanisms by which SERPINE1 mediates anoikis resistance and fosters an immunosuppressive TME in advanced GC. SERPINE1 is highly expressed in GC tissues and metastatic lesions and serves as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. The transcriptional activation of SERPINE1 by CEBPB triggers the PI3K/AKT and EMT signaling pathway via autocrine mechanisms, enhancing anoikis resistance and metastatic potential in GC cells. Furthermore, SERPINE1 facilitates M2 macrophage polarization by binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in a paracrine manner, suppressing CD8+ T-cell infiltration and functionality in the TME. Therapeutic intervention combining SERPINE1 inhibition with PD-1 blockade exhibits synergistic antitumor effects. Clinically, high SERPINE1 expression is associated with an increased risk of recurrence following immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with advanced GC. These findings suggest that SERPINE1 is a critical driver of GC progression through anoikis resistance and TME remodeling. Hence, SERPINE1 can offer a promising therapeutic target and represent a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy outcomes in GC.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of immunotherapy plays a pivotal role in the clinical management of skin melanoma. Graph neural networks (GNNs), alongside other deep learning algorithms and bioinformatics approaches, have demonstrated substantial promise in advancing cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies. GNNs models were developed to predict the response to immunotherapy and to pinpoint key pathways. Utilizing the genes from these key pathways, multi-omics bioinformatics methods were employed to refine the construction of a gene signature, termed responseScore, aimed at enhancing the precision of immunotherapy response predictions. Subsequently, responseScore was explored from the perspectives of prognosis, genetic variation, pathway enrichment, and the tumor microenvironment. Concurrently, the association among 13 genes contributing to responseScore and factors such as immunotherapy response, prognosis, and the tumor microenvironment was investigated. Among these genes, PSMB6 was subjected to an in-depth analysis of its biological effect through experimental approaches like transfection and co-culture. In the finalized model utilizing GNNs, it has revealed an AUC of 0.854 within the training dataset and 0.824 within the testing set, pinpointing key pathways such as R-HSA-70,268. The indicator named as responseScore excelled in its predictive accuracy regarding immunotherapy response and patient prognosis. Investigations into genetic variation, pathway enrichment, tumor microenvironment disclosed a profound association between responseScore and the enhancement of immune cell infiltration and anti-tumor immunity. A negative correlation was observed between the expression of PSMB6 and immune genes, with elevated PSMB6 expression correlating with poor prognosis. ELISA detection after co-cultivation experiments revealed significant reductions in the levels of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in specimens from the PCDH-PSMB6 group. The GNNs prediction model and the responseScore developed in this research effectively indicate the immunotherapy response and prognosis for patients with skin melanoma. Additionally, responseScore provides insights into the tumor microenvironment and the characteristics of tumor immunity of melanoma. Thirteen genes identified in this study show promise as potential tumor markers or therapeutic targets. Notably, PSMB6 emerges as a potential therapeutic target for skin melanoma, where its elevated expression exhibits an inhibitory effect on the tumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers constitute approximately 25% of cancers worldwide. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family is a promising target for immunotherapy aiming\u00a0 to enhance survival rates. FGFR alterations are associated with GI carcinomas. Their predictive value in different malignancies remains a focus area. While FGFR inhibitors have been approved for cholangiocarcinoma (CC) therapy, uncertainties remain regarding other GI cancers. A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. The search terms included \"FGFR\" and each of the GI malignancies. A total of 18 studies were included in this review. The efficacy of FGFR-targeted therapy is evident. Strong evidence supports the use of FGFR inhibitors in CC, gastro-oesophageal cancer (GC/OC), and hepatocellular cancer, while there is limited evidence for pancreatic cancer (PC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Alteration forms like FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement are associated with CC, while\u00a0FGFR2 amplification and\u00a0FGFR2b overexpression are associated with GC/OC. The administration of multi-kinase inhibitors without prior genomic testing, makes distinct study outcomes not solely attributable to the FGFR blockade. FGFRs have a predictive value for GI cancers. Certain FGFR alterations are predictable for specific GI cancers. The most established FGFR-targeted therapy is for CC. It is essential to expand the FGFR research field for PC and CRC. Consistent molecular diagnostics in clinical trials are vital to comprehend the patient population with the highest efficacy.",

The model accurately describes 25 patient time courses with different responses and IL-6 cytokine kinetics. We successfully link the dynamic shape of the response to interpretable model parameters and investigate the influence of CAR-T cell dose and initial tumor burden on the occurrence of cytokine release and treatment outcome. By disentangling the timeline of macrophage activation, the model identified distinct contributions of each activation mechanism, suggesting the CD40-CD40L axis as a major driver of cytokine release and a clinically feasible target to control the activation process and modulate cytokine peak height. Our multi-layer model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between CAR-T cells, tumor cells, and macrophages during therapy.",

    "abstract": "Acquired drug resistance is a main factor contributing to cancer therapy failure and high cancer mortality, highlighting the necessity to develop novel intervention targets. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), an abundant class of RNA molecules with a closed loop structure, possess characteristics including high stability, which provide unique advantages in clinical application. Growing evidence indicates that aberrantly expressed circRNAs are associated with resistance against various cancer treatments, including targeted therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Therefore, targeting these aberrant circRNAs may offer a strategy to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy. Herein, we present a summary of the most recently studied circRNAs and their regulatory roles on cancer drug resistance. With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based bioinformatics algorithms, circRNAs could emerge as promising biomarkers and intervention targets in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a transformative approach in breast cancer therapy, offering targeted treatment with reduced toxicity by selectively delivering cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. While ADCs like trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan have shown significant efficacy, resistance mechanisms such as antigen loss, impaired internalization, and efflux of cytotoxic payloads challenge their effectiveness. This review discusses these resistance mechanisms and explores advanced strategies to overcome them, including innovations in linker chemistry, multi-antigen targeting, and biomarker-driven personalization. Additionally, therapeutic sequencing - determining the optimal order of ADCs with other treatments such as chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and immunotherapy - is examined as a crucial approach to maximize ADC efficacy and manage resistance. Evidence-based sequencing strategies, particularly for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are supported by clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of ADCs in both early-stage and metastatic settings. The potential of combination therapies, such as ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), further highlights the evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment. As ADC technology advances, personalized approaches integrating biomarkers and optimized sequencing protocols offer promising avenues to enhance treatment outcomes and combat resistance in breast cancer.",

Although natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative approach, its efficacy in treating hematologic malignancies remains to be fully elucidated. CD5-targeted CAR-modified primary NK cells, T cells and NK92 cell lines were generated and comprehensively evaluated for their anti-tumor efficacy through in vitro cytotoxicity assays and xenograft mouse models. Furthermore, preliminary investigation of the herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) suicide switch system in CAR-NK cells were conducted using ganciclovir (GCV) as the activating agent. CAR-NK cells exhibited significantly increased cytotoxic activity against CD5-positive cell lines and primary tumor cells, compared to NK, CAR-NK92, and CAR-T cells. Moreover, CAR-NK cells effectively decreased the leukemic burden and extended survival in murine model. Additionally, an off-switch utilizing the HSV-TK switch system successfully eradicated CAR-NK cells for safety considerations. This study developed a controllable CD5 CAR-NK cells that exhibit high efficacy against T-cell malignancies, although further validation is necessary to assess their clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma (SKCM) is an extremely aggressive form of cancer, characterized by high mortality rates, frequent metastasis, and limited treatment options. Our study aims to identify key target genes and enhance the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma prognosis by employing multi-omics analysis and machine learning techniques, ultimately leading to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We obtained and processed transcriptomic data, including RNA expression profiles, methylation microarray data, gene mutation data, and clinical information, from the TCGA dataset using multi-omics analysis and machine learning techniques. We comprehensively evaluated the molecular subtypes of melanoma, the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and their effects on patient outcomes. By analyzing the TCGA-SKCM and GEO cohorts, we identified three melanoma subtypes with distinct prognostic features. Additionally, we developed a machine learning-driven signature (MLDS) based on marker genes for different molecular subtypes to significantly improve the prognostic prediction accuracy for melanoma patients. We also extensively examined differences in clinical features, immune cell infiltration, mutational landscapes, and drug treatment effects between high- and low-scoring subgroups. The predictive reliability of MLDS was further explored by knocking down the key signature gene AGPAT2 in melanoma cells using small interfering RNA. The MLDS demonstrated high C-index values in both the training and validation cohorts, indicating its potential for clinical decision-making. The study also found that MLDS scores were associated with reduced immune cell infiltration and lower expression levels of immune checkpoints. Patients in the low MLDS group may be more responsive to chemotherapeutic agents and more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that the MAPK signaling pathway between AGPAT2\u2009+\u2009melanoma cells and fibroblasts/myeloid cells promotes tumor survival in the TME. Finally, the oncogenic role of AGPAT2 in melanoma cell lines was successfully confirmed through cell function assays and subcutaneous tumor formation assays in nude mice. This study not only uncovers the diversity and complexity of melanoma molecular subtypes but also underscores the crucial role of the TME in melanoma progression. It provides new insights and tools for personalized treatment and prognostic assessment of SKCM.",

However, the role of CD44 in cancer immunology is not well defined. Therefore, we intended to explore its\u00a0prognostic value and potential immunological functions across 33 human cancer types. Based on the data of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Sangerbox was used to analyze the correlations between CD44 expression and tumor-infiltrated immune cells, immune checkpoints, neoantigens, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in human cancers. A mouse model xenografted with shRNA-CD44 MC38 was established. The elevated CD44 was associated with tumor stage and prognosis in several different cancers. GSEA results showed that upregulated CD44 involved in cancer stem cell associated process, antigen processing and presentation, and immune cells proliferation and activation. CD44 plays an essential role in the tumor immune regulation and immune checkpoints inhibitor response. The correlation of CD44 gene expression and infiltration levels of immune cells varied across different cancer types. Notably, the upregulation of CD44 expression is positively correlated with regulatory CD4 T cells, macrophages M1 and M2 in several analyzed cancers. Furthermore, we verified the effect of CD44 on tumor growth and immune microenvironment in mouse xenografted with shRNA-CD44 MC38. Moreover, DNA methylation existed in CD44 expression and associated with dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes via different mechanisms, thus resulting in tissue-dependent prognoses. CD44 is both a cancer stem cell marker and a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in various malignant tumors. Moreover, CD44 could be a novel target for immune-based therapy.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes, characterized by their bilayer lipid structure, are crucial in mediating intercellular signaling and contributing to various physiological processes. Tumor cells produce distinct exosomes facilitating cancer progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis by conveying signaling molecules. A notable feature of these tumor-derived exosomes is the presence of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on their surface. The PD-L1/programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) signaling axis serves as a critical immune checkpoint, enabling tumors to evade immune detection and antitumor activity. The advancement of immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has significantly impacted the treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite its promise, evidence indicates that many patients experience limited responses or develop resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Recent studies suggest that exosomal PD-L1 contributes to this resistance by modulating immune responses and tumor adaptability. This study reviews the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway's characteristics, current clinical findings on PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC, and exosome-specific attributes, with a particular focus on exosomal PD-L1. Furthermore, it examines the growing body of research investigating the role of exosomal PD-L1 in cancer progression and response to immunotherapy, underscoring its potential as a target for overcoming resistance in NSCLC treatment.",

Increasing evidence suggests that \u03b3\u03b4T cells play distinct roles in different cancers. However, the impact of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the role of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer using a comprehensive approach, including bulk and single-cell sequencing, radiomics based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genomic data, and immunohistochemistry. Single-cell RNA profiling was used to infer the potential lineage evolution of \u03b3\u03b4T cells and their interactions with other immune cells. Bulk RNA sequencing was included to uncover the heterogeneity in signaling pathways, as well as radiotherapy and immunotherapy responses, among patients with varying levels of \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance. Genomic analysis was used to recognize the critical gene mutations with the infiltration of \u03b3\u03b4T cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate the prognostic value of \u03b3\u03b4T cells in breast cancer patients. Lastly, radiomics was used to establish a correlation between the abundance of \u03b3\u03b4T cells and the features of MRI images. The \u03b3\u03b4T cell infiltration was closely associated with favorable prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but not in other subtypes of breast cancer. \u03b3\u03b4T cells may exert antitumor effects through intrinsic lineage evolution or interact with antigen-presenting cells through ligand-receptor pairs. Patients with a high \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance may benefit more from chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone than their combination. Additionally, patients with a high \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we established a radiomic model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI, which indicated the potential for estimating the \u03b3\u03b4T cell abundance for patients with TNBC. Our study provides novel insight and a theoretical basis for individualized therapy of patients with TNBC based on \u03b3\u03b4T cells.",

    "abstract": "While immunotherapy has transformed treatment across various cancers, its impact on breast cancer is relatively limited. Recent advances have established immunotherapy as an effective approach for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic targets and poor prognosis. Specifically, pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), is now approved for both first-line metastatic and early-stage TNBC. In metastatic TNBC, combining ICIs with chemotherapy, particularly pembrolizumab, has demonstrated survival benefits in patients with PD-L1-positive disease. However, extending these benefits to broader populations has proven challenging, highlighting the need for better patient selection and novel strategies. Emerging approaches include combining ICIs with antibody-drug conjugates, PARP inhibitors, dual ICIs, and bispecific antibodies targeting angiogenesis and immune checkpoints. These strategies aim to overcome resistance and expand immunotherapy's efficacy beyond the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In early-stage disease, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has significantly improved pathologic complete response, event-free survival, and overall survival, establishing a new standard of care. Ongoing research aims to determine the optimal timing for ICI administration, explore less toxic chemotherapy backbones, utilize biomarkers for personalized treatment, and assess whether adding complementary treatments, such as radiation therapy for high-risk cases, can improve outcomes. This review examines the successes and setbacks of ICI use in TNBC, offering a comprehensive overview of current practices and future directions. It emphasizes optimizing ICI timing, leveraging biomarkers, and integrating novel agents to refine treatment approaches for both metastatic and early-stage TNBC. As immunotherapy continues to evolve, future research must address the unmet needs of this challenging breast cancer subtype, offering hope for improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA4 or PD-1) has opened a new chapter in tumor immunotherapy by providing long-term remission for patients. Unfortunately, however, these agents are not universally available and only a minority of patients respond to them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting other co-inhibitory molecules. However, comprehensive information on the expression and prognostic value of co-inhibitory molecules, including co-inhibitory receptors and their ligands, in different cancers is not yet available. We investigated the expression, correlation, and prognostic value of co-inhibitory molecules in different cancer types based on TCGA, UCSC Xena, TIMER, CellMiner datasets. We also examined the associations between the expression of these molecules and the extent of immune cell infiltration. Besides, we conducted a more in-depth study of VISTA. The results of differential expression analysis, correlation analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis suggest that CTLA4, PD-1, TIGIT, LAG3, TIM3, NRP1, VISTA, CD80, CD86, PD-L1, PD-L2, PVR, PVRL2, FGL1, LGALS9, HMGB1, SEMA4A, and VEGFA are associated with tumor prognosis and immune cell infiltration. Therefore, we believe that they are hopefully to serve as prognostic biomarkers for certain cancers. In addition, our analysis indicates that VISTA plays a complex role and its expression is related to TMB, MSI, cancer cell stemness, DNA/RNA methylation, and drug sensitivity. These co-inhibitory molecules have the potential to serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of cancers, given their strong associations with key clinical metrics. Furthermore, the analysis results indicate that VISTA may represent a promising target for cancer therapy.",

However, there remains a scarcity of research that has thoroughly and systematically delineated the characteristics of TILBs in LUAD. The research employed single-cell RNA sequencing from the GSE117570 dataset to identify markers linked to TILBs. A comprehensive machine learning approach, utilizing ten distinct algorithms, facilitated the creation of a TILB-related index (BRI) across the TCGA, GSE31210, and GSE72094 datasets. We used multiple algorithms to evaluate the relationships between BRI and TIME, as well as immune therapy-related biomarkers. Additionally, we assessed the role of BRI in predicting immune therapy response in two datasets, GSE91061 and GSE126044. BRI functioned as an independent risk determinant in LUAD, demonstrating a robust and reliable capacity to predict overall survival rates. We observed significant differences in the scores of B cells, M2 macrophages, NK cells, and regulatory T cells between the high and low BRI score groups. Notably, BRI was found to inversely correlate with cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell infiltration (r = -0.43, p < 0.001) and positively correlate with regulatory T cells (r = 0.31, p = 0.008). We also found that patients with lower BRI were more likely to respond to immunotherapy and were associated with reduced IC50 values for standard chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs, in contrast to higher BRI. Additionally, the BRI-based survival prediction nomogram demonstrated significant promise for clinical application in predicting the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates among LUAD patients. Our study developed a BRI model using ten different algorithms and 101 algorithm combinations. The BRI could be a valuable tool for risk stratification, prognosis, and selection of treatment approaches.",

However, harnessing this tumor suppressor pathway is challenging because PD-1 activation by PD-L1 also suppresses normal T-cell function. We hypothesized that cancer antigen-specific TCR-T cells engineered to express PD-L1 could selectively activate the PD-1 pathway in tumor cells while simultaneously preventing self-inhibition by knocking out intrinsic PD-1 expression in TCR-T cells. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed a MAGE-C2-specific recombinant TCR and the PD-L1-encoding CD274 gene in normal human T cells in which the PDCD1 gene was knocked out. These engineered TCR-T cells targeted MAGE-C2-expressing malignant cells, activating PD-1 signaling to suppress tumor proliferation while maintaining suppressed PD-1 signaling in the TCR-T cells themselves. To evaluate the tumor-suppressive potential of this approach, we compared the efficacy of PDL1-MC2-TCR-T",

Conventional therapies such as thoracentesis and pleurodesis are for symptom relief but palliative, without inducing immunity and prolonging survival. Emerging new bioengineered drugs, synergizing with immunotherapies, offer a new paradigm by dual-targeting TME remodeling and immune activation. These technologies leverage nanotechnology, gene editing, and biomaterials to offer precise spatiotemporal control. This review illustrates the molecular mechanism of the immunosuppressive TME in MPE. It examines the newest bioengineering platforms-such as cytokine-encapsulated nanoparticles and oncolytic viruses-that can reactivate immune mechanisms. We highlight preclinical and clinical evidence of the effectiveness of combinatorial strategies in overcoming local immune tolerance and potential risks in adverse events. While the clinical transformation challenge remains, future directions necessitate cross-disciplinary convergence to engineer intelligent delivery vehicles and predictive biomarkers for patient stratification. By integrating immunotherapy with bioengineering, this strategy not only restores antitumor immunity but also portends a new epoch of precision medicine for MPE.",

    "title": "Metabolic reprogramming shapes the immune microenvironment in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: prognostic implications and therapeutic targets.",
    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is characterized by a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits the efficacy of immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor-specific metabolic reprogramming may drive disease progression and shape the immune landscape in PAAD. We integrated multi-omics data from TCGA, GEO, and ICGC to identify key metabolism-related genes (MRGs) that influence immune cell infiltration, tumor progression, and patient survival. Based on nine pivotal MRGs (including ANLN, PKMYT1, and HMGA1), we developed and validated a novel metabolic-prognostic index (MPI). Functional enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the metabolic pathways associated with different MPI risk groups.  The MPI effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups. High-MPI scores correlated with poor overall survival, elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB), and an immunosuppressive TME, evidenced by reduced CD8\u207a T-cell infiltration and increased expression of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, TGF-\u03b2). Functional enrichment revealed glycolysis and folate biosynthesis as dominant pathways in high-MPI groups, whereas fatty acid metabolism prevailed in low-MPI groups. Experimental validation underscored the role of ANLN in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune evasion via NF-\u03baB signaling. ANLN knockdown significantly reduced glycolytic activity, tumor cell migration, and immune evasion. Drug sensitivity analyses indicated resistance to gemcitabine but sensitivity to afatinib in high-MPI patients. Although TIDE analysis predicted immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance in high-MPI tumors, a subset of patients showed favorable responses to anti-PD-L1 therapy. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how metabolic reprogramming shapes PAAD's immunosuppressive TME and affects treatment outcomes. By accurately stratifying patients, the MPI serves as a promising tool to guide therapeutic decisions, including targeted therapy selection and immunotherapy prediction, ultimately offering potential for more personalized management of PAAD.",

    "abstract": "Skin cutaneous malignant melanoma (SKCM) is among the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, notorious for its rapid progression and poor prognosis under late diagnosis. This study investigates the role of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRGs) in SKCM addressing a gap in understanding how CRGs affect tumor progression and patient outcomes. An analysis of CRGs expression was conducted on SKCM samples derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets(TCGA). Moreover, a correlation between various subtypes and their clinical features was identified. The study employed various bioinformatics methods, including differential expression analysis, consensus clustering, and survival analysis, to investigate the role of CRGs. The functional consequences of various CRG expression patterns were further investigated using immune infiltration analysis and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). A scoring system based on CRGs was developed to predict overall survival (OS) and treatment responses in SKCM patients. The predictive accuracy of this score system was then tested, and a nomogram was used to improve its clinical usefulness. Key findings from this study include significant genetic alterations in circadian rhythm-related genes (CRGs) in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), such as mutations and CNVs. Two molecular subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes and immune profiles were identified. A prognostic model based on six CRGs ( This work provides valuable insights into the circadian regulation of SKCM and underscores the potential of CRGs as biomarkers for prognosis and targets for therapeutic interventions. The novel molecular subtypes and CRGs prognostic scoring model introduced in this study offer significant contributions to the understanding and management of SKCM.",

    "abstract": "The SUSD3 protein, marked by the Sushi domain, plays a key role in cancer progression, with its expression linked to tumor advancement and patient prognosis. Altered SUSD3 levels could serve as a predictive biomarker for cancer progression. Recognized as a novel susceptibility marker, SUSD3 presents a promising target for antibody-based therapies, offering a potential approach for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. Using the HPA and GeneMANIA platforms, the distribution of SUSD3 protein across tissues was analyzed, while expression levels in tumor and healthy tissues were compared using The Cancer Genome Atlas data. The TISCH and STOmics DB databases facilitated the mapping of SUSD3 expression in different cell types and its spatial relationship with cancer markers. Univariate Cox regression assessed the prognostic significance of SUSD3 expression in various cancers. Genomic alterations of SUSD3 were explored through the cBioPortal database. The potential of SUSD3 as a predictor of immunotherapy response was investigated using TIMER2.0, and GSEA/GSVA identified related biological pathways. Drugs targeting SUSD3 were identified through CellMiner, CTRP, and GDSC databases, complemented by molecular docking studies.  SUSD3 expression variations in pan-cancer cohorts are closely linked to the prognosis of various malignancies. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), SUSD3 is predominantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Research indicates a strong correlation between SUSD3 expression and key cancer immunotherapy biomarkers, immune cell infiltration, and immunomodulatory factors. To explore its immune regulatory role, StromalScore, ImmuneScore, ESTIMATE, and Immune Infiltration metrics were employed. Molecular docking studies revealed that selumetinib inhibits tumor cell proliferation. Finally, SUSD3 knockdown reduced cancer cell proliferation and migration. These findings provide valuable insights and establish a foundation for further exploration of SUSD3's role in pan-carcinomas. Additionally, they offer novel perspectives and potential targets for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 35 (USP35) has gained attention as a regulator in cancer progression. However, its specific role in kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) remains unclear. USP35 expression in KIRC tumor and normal tissues was evaluated using TCGA data. Correlations between USP35 expression, clinical parameters, and survival outcomes were examined. Functional enrichment analyses were performed to explore the pathways associated with USP35 expression. Immune-related analyses were conducted to assess the effect of USP35 on immune cell recruitment and neoantigen presentation. Drug sensitivity analyses were used to identify potential therapeutic agents targeting USP35. USP35 was significantly overexpressed in KIRC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression correlated with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that high USP35 expression was associated with oncogenic pathways, including glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid metabolism, while low expression linked to nitrogen and purine metabolism. USP35 also modulated immune responses, affecting immune cell recruitment and neoantigen presentation, suggesting a role in immune evasion. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that high USP35 expression correlated with increased sensitivity to paclitaxel, bosutinib, and lapatinib. In vitro knockdown of USP35 significantly reduced KIRC cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further supporting its role in tumor progression. USP35 is overexpressed in KIRC and associated with poor prognosis, likely promoting tumor progression through oncogenic pathways and immune modulation. Its correlation with drug sensitivity positions USP35 as a potential therapeutic target, warranting further investigation into its mechanistic functions and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) primarily exist in the M2-like phenotype in the tumor microenvironment (TME). M2-TAMs contribute to tumor progression by establishing an immunosuppressive environment. However, TAM targeting is hindered, mainly owing to a lack of specific biomarkers for M2-TAMs. Previously, we demonstrated that a novel peptide drug conjugate (TB511) consisting of a TAM-binding peptide and the apoptosis-promoting peptide targets M2-TAMs. This was achieved through M2-TAM targeting, although the target mechanism of action remained elusive. Herein, we elucidate the anticancer efficacy of TB511 by identifying new target proteins that preferentially bind to M2-TAMs and clarifying the apoptosis-inducing mechanism in these cells. We investigated the target proteins and binding site of TB511 using LC-MS/MS analyses, surface plasmon resonance and peptide-protein interaction 3D modeling. Activated CD18 expression in M2 TAMs was assessed using Quantibrite PE beads in PBMCs. The anticancer efficacy of TB511 was tested using colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mouse model. The immunotherapeutic effect of TB511 was investigated through spatial transcriptomics in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model. Activated CD18 was highly expressed in human tumor tissues and was significantly higher in M2 TAMs than in other immune cells. TB511 showed high binding affinity to CD18 among the cell membrane proteins of M2 macrophages and appeared to bind to the cysteine-rich domain in the activated form. Moreover, TB511 specifically induced apoptosis in M2 TAMs, but its targeting ability to M2 macrophages was inhibited in CD18 blockade or knockout model. In mouse or humanized mouse models of solid tumors such as CRC, NSCLC, and PDAC, TB511 suppressed tumor growth by targeting M2-TAMs via CD18 and enhancing the presence of CD8 Collectively, our findings suggest that activated CD18 holds promise as a novel target protein for cancer therapy, and TB511 shows potential as a therapeutic agent for tumor treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cardio-oncology is an emerging interdisciplinary field concerned with cancer treatment-related cardiovascular toxicities (CTR-CVT) and concomitant cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with cancer. Inflammation and immune system dysregulation are common features of tumors and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition to the mutual exacerbating effect through inflammation, tumor treatments, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy, may induce immune inflammatory reactions leading to cardiovascular damage. Cancer immunotherapy is currently a new method of cancer treatment. Immunotherapeutic agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T), mRNA vaccines, etc., can induce anti-tumor effects by enhancing the host immune response to eliminate tumor cells. They have achieved remarkable therapeutic efficacy in clinical settings but lead to many immune-related adverse events (irAEs), especially CTR-CVT. Establishing specific evaluation, diagnostic, and monitoring criteria (e.g., inflammatory biomarkers) for both immunotherapy and anti-inflammatory therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity is vital to guide clinical practice. This article explores the role of immune response and inflammation in tumor cardiology, unravels the underlying mechanisms, and provides improved methods for monitoring and treating in CTR-CVT in the field of cardio-oncology.",

Here, we present a case report and in-depth molecular analysis of an erythema nodosum (EN) like irAE occurring in a melanoma patient with isolated brain metastasis, aiming to explore the potential mechanism of this irAE. We performed RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on the patient's resected brain metastasis and biopsy of EN-like irAE. Single cell RNA/TCR sequencing was conducted on the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline, 3 weeks after ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy, during EN toxicity and after resolution. The site of EN-like irAE showed a distinct accumulation of pro-inflammatory immune cells, accompanied by the upregulation of inflammatory and interferon response signatures. In addition, clonal expansion and activation of irAE-associated CD8 T cells and upregulation of monocyte-specific interferon signatures occurred concurrently with irAE onset. The unique immune landscape at the EN-like irAE could indicate that this irAE is distinct from anti-tumor immune and analogous non-ICI autoimmune milieus.

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized oncology, significantly improving survival across multiple cancer types. ICIs, such as anti-PD-1 (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (e.g. atezolizumab, avelumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (e.g. ipilimumab), enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses but can also trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Neurological irAEs (n-irAEs), affecting 1-3% of patients, predominantly involve the peripheral nervous system; less commonly, n-irAEs can present as central nervous system disorders. Although irAEs suggest a possible correlation with treatment efficacy, their mechanisms remain unclear, with hypotheses ranging from antigen mimicry to cytokine dysregulation and microbiome alterations. Identifying patients at risk for n-irAEs and predicting their outcome through biomarkers would be highly desirable. For example, patients with high-risk onconeural antibodies (such as anti-Hu or Ma2), and elevated neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels often respond poorly to irAE treatment. However, interpreting neuronal antibody tests in the diagnosis of n-irAEs requires caution: positive results must align with the clinical context, as some cancer patients (e.g., SCLC) may have asymptomatic low antibody levels, and false positive results are common without tissue-based confirmation. Also, the use of biomarkers (e.g. IL-6) may lead to more targeted treatments of irAEs, minimizing adverse effects without compromising the anti-tumor efficacy of ICIs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest findings on n-irAEs associated with ICIs, with a focus on their prediction, prevention, as well as precision treatment using autoantibodies, cytokines, and microbiota. The most interesting data concern neuronal antibodies, which we explore in their pathogenic roles and as biomarkers of neurotoxicity. Most of the available data on cytokines, both regarding their role as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and their role in supporting therapeutic decisions for toxicities, refer to non-neurological toxicities. However, in our review, we mention the potential role of CXCL10 and CXCL13 as biomarkers of n-irAEs and describe the current evidence, as well as the need for further studies, on the use of cytokines in guiding selection of second-line therapies for n-irAEs. Finally, no specific microbiome-related microbial signature has been proven to be linked to n-irAEs specifically, leading to the need of more future research on the topic.",

    "abstract": "Soluble programmed cell death receptor-1 (sPD-1) blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, reverses tumor immune suppression, and inhibits tumor growth. However, clinical applications are limited by its poor tissue distribution and rapid dispersion. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are favorable carriers for tumor immunotherapy due to their capacity for external gene introduction and targeted tumor homing. However, they may inadvertently promote tumor growth. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) inhibits BMSC-mediated tumor growth and stimulates antigen-presenting cells to activate T lymphocytes. This study utilizes BMSCs transfected with IFN-\u03b3 as carriers for sPD-1, enabling the targeted homing of sPD-1 to tumor tissues, thereby enhancing the efficacy and sustained stability of immunotherapy. stable IFN-\u03b3- and sPD-1-overexpressing BMSCs were successfully constructed by lentiviral transfection. A non-contact co-culture system was established with Lewis and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells to observe changes in the lung cancer cells after co-culture, using assays including cell migration and invasion experiments, as well as cellular senescence detection. Additionally, a subcutaneous lung adenocarcinoma model was established in C57BL/6J mice for intervention studies. Tumor volume, cellular apoptosis in tumor tissue (assessed by TUNEL assay), peripheral Treg cells (analyzed by flow cytometry), and histopathological markers (evaluated by HE staining and immunohistochemistry) were analyzed. The expression levels of BAX, BCL-2, AKT, PI3K, and PD-L1 were assessed by quantitative PCR and Western Blot. IFN-\u03b3- and sPD-1-overexpressing BMSCs exhibited high bioactivity and genetic stability, inhibiting lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, accelerating cellular senescence, and reducing migration and invasion. Furthermore, they upregulate Bax expression, downregulate Bcl-2, and promote apoptosis. Additionally, these cells alleviate inflammatory damage in lung tissue of tumor-bearing mice, lower Treg cell levels to inhibit tumor immune evasion, and reduce the expression of PI3K/AKT and PD-L1. IFN-\u03b3- and sPD-1-overexpressing BMSCs effectively inhibit lung adenocarcinoma cell growth and tumor progression. The primary mechanisms include suppression of cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion; promotion of apoptosis and senescence in cancer cells; modulation of Treg cells; and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways.",

    "abstract": "C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (CLEC12A) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in innate immune cells, where it plays a crucial role in immune modulation and has been implicated in cancer progression. However, its precise function in oncogenesis and immune infiltration remains incompletely understood. To investigate this, we utilized multiple databases to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of CLEC12A across normal tissues and a broad spectrum of cancers. We also evaluated its prognostic and diagnostic significance in pan-cancer contexts. Furthermore, the relationship between CLEC12A expression and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, and immune predictors was explored. In addition, Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis were performed to examine the biological relevance of CLEC12A in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We also leveraged various databases to predict CLEC12A's response to immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. Finally, in vitro experiments validated the functional role of CLEC12A in LUAD. Our comprehensive pan-cancer analysis revealed that CLEC12A exhibited distinct expression patterns across different cancer types, suggesting its potential as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Notably, CLEC12A expression was strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, and immune predictors. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted that increased CLEC12A expression in LUAD was associated with a variety of immune-related biological processes and pathways. Moreover, CLEC12A showed significant predictive value for immunotherapy outcomes, and several drugs targeting CLEC12A were identified. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that CLEC12A overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells. Taken together, our findings position CLEC12A as a promising candidate for cancer detection, prognosis, and as a therapeutic target, particularly in LUAD, where it may serve as a potential target for both immunotherapy and targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, evidence has shown that the gut microbiome significantly influences responses to immunotherapy. This has sparked interest in targeting it to improve therapy outcomes and predictions of response and toxicity. Research has demonstrated that dysbiosis, often resulting from antibiotic use, can diminish the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and this lack of efficacy could be linked to systemic inflammation. Certain bacterial species have been identified as having beneficial and harmful effects on immunotherapy in the clinic. While a clear consensus has yet to emerge on the optimal species for therapeutic use, introducing a new microbiome into immunotherapy-refractory patients may boost their chances of responding to further treatment attempts. State-of-the-art interventions targeting the microbiome-such as fecal microbiota transplantation-are being assessed clinically for their safety and potential to enhance treatment outcomes, with promising results. Additionally, the microbiome has been leveraged for its power to predict clinical outcomes using machine learning, and surprisingly, its predictive capability is comparable to that of other described multi-biomarker clinical scores. Here, we discuss developing knowledge concerning the microbiome's significance in cancer immunotherapy and outline future strategies for maximizing its potential in immuno-oncology.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can induce antitumor efficacy but also induces immune-related adverse events. Systemically administered ICB can activate immune cells throughout the host. Conditionally active ICB with proteolytically cleaved masking domains can potentially reduce the adverse events seen with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody. We examined how different formats of a conditionally activated dual variable domain IgG (DVD) that binds CTLA-4 and the tumor-associated antigen prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) can lead to efficacy in syngeneic subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models. We also defined the capacity of these DVDs to modulate immune responses by multiparameter flow cytometry. Conditionally active DVDs can uncouple antitumor efficacy from toxicity. A fully cleavable construct (symmetric DVD, sDVD), which can be released from the target tumor cells, showed superior antitumor efficacy compared with asymmetric DVD, which retains its tumor antigen binding. The sDVD elicited the highest tumor-antigen-specific T-cell responses detected in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes, as well as presenting the highest rate of intratumoral and splenic \"non-exhausted\" antigen-specific CD8 T cells. SDVD also induced the highest degrees of T-cell memory and self-renewal potential. These effects were dependent on PSCA expression by the tumors. These findings support the notion that ICB modulation of antitumor immunity away from the tumor cells is critically important for optimal antitumor immunity. The bispecific sDVD antibody design may enable improved systemic antitumor responses than traditional ICB in both primary tumors and metastases.",

    "abstract": "Neurological complications are an important concern in patients undergoing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Consensus guidelines inform the management of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). However, these guidelines are based on the early clinical experience with CD19 targeting CAR T cells in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, there are so far no published best practice recommendations on the current management of other non-classical neurological complications, which frequently develop after CAR T-cell infusion and cause clinically significant neurotoxicity. These non-classical neurological complications could be more prevalent because of additional CAR T-cell targets (eg, B cell maturation antigen [BCMA]), widened access, new indications in clinical development (including solid tumours in the CNS), and long-term follow-up. In this Review, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Practice Harmonisation and Guidelines Committee provides recommendations on the management of CAR T-cell associated neurological complications that occur after treatment with the licensed CD19 and BCMA CAR T cells, as well as neurological toxicities that are emerging with CAR T cells in clinical trials for solid and haematological cancers. We address movement and neurocognitive toxicity, cranial nerve palsies, tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity, stroke, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, fludarabine-associated neurotoxicity, and provide guidance on the psychological support for patients. CNS infections were excluded. The guidelines were developed based on the currently available literature and expert opinion. Recommendations are provided when possible, and areas for further research are highlighted to provide a framework to improve patient care.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), particularly Programmed Death-1 (PD1) antibody treatment, has revolutionized the clinical management of many previously undruggable types bladder cancer (BC). However, it remains unclear whether nerve-invaded BC patients benefit from immunotherapy. Here, we utilized public databases to show that BC patients with high neural signal expression are associated with more advanced tumor stages. Analysis of patient tumor samples revealed significant neural expression within classical tertiary lymphoid structures, and this was inversely correlated with the immune levels. In a denervated mouse bladder tumor model, we found that nerve ablation significantly inhibited tumor progression. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing data revealed that nerve fibers suppressed the activity of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, while denervation alleviated immune suppression and restored cytotoxic activity. Denervation enhanced the immune response by downregulating Pdcd1 (encoded Pd1) expression in natural killer (NK) cells. Pathological analysis of patient tumor samples further confirmed that higher neural abundance was strongly correlated with PD1 expression. Finally, through database analysis and clinical sample validation, we demonstrated that BC patients with high neural signaling showed better responses to ICT. Overall, this study highlights the potential for targeted immunotherapy in nerve-invasive BC, providing a novel framework for enhancing the effectiveness of ICT in treating this subset of bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is one of the most common malignant diseases and contributes to the annual burden of death worldwide. A better understanding of the underlying molecular changes is urgently required to identify early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutics. The chemokine-like factor (CKLF)-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family (CMTMs) is reported to be entangled in many human cancers. However, the role of CMTMs in ESCA remains unclear. The differential expressions of CMTMs between ESCA and normal tissues were analyzed using TCGA database. The relationships between CMTMs and immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) were also evaluated to explore their underlying values in the diagnosis and prognosis of ESCA. The results showed that ESCA showed significantly higher expressions of CMTM1,3,6,7 and lower expressions of CMTM4,5 than normal tissue (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Meanwhile, CMTM3,4,8 expressions were correlated with the tumor stage of ECSA patients. The analysis on immune infiltrations (CD8\u2009+ T, Tregs, NK and macrophages) showed that M2 macrophages was dominant in TME, with significantly higher levels than the other cells (F\u2009=\u2009326.93, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The higher abundance of M2 macrophages and Tregs significantly shortened the survival time of patients with ESCA (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Interestingly, the expression levels of CMTM1,3,5,7 were comparable to the abundance of M2 macrophages (CMTM1: r\u2009=\u20090.172168; CMTM3: r\u2009=\u20090.313221; CMTM5: r\u2009=\u20090.130669; CMTM7: r\u2009=\u20090.119922; P\u2009<\u20090.05). CMTM2,4,5,7,8 positively correlated with Tregs (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, we found positive associations between the expression of CMTMs and the signatures of M2 macrophages (MS4A4A, VSIG4 and CD163). There were differential expressions of CMTMs between ESCA and normal tissues. Furthermore, the expression of CMTMs was positively correlated with M2 macrophages, indicating a possibility that CMTMs may become a new immunotherapy target for ESCA.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The high mortality rate is primarily driven by delayed diagnosis, rapid metastasis, and frequent recurrence. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) have emerged as critical mediators in NSCLC progression, offering valuable insights into the tumor microenvironment. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that facilitate intercellular communication and transport bioactive molecules, including proteins, RNAs, and DNAs, thereby reflecting the genetic complexity of tumors. These exosomes play a key role in promoting tumor metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), neovascularization, drug resistance, and immune evasion, all of which are pivotal in the development of NSCLC. This review explores the diverse roles of TEXs in NSCLC progression, focusing on their involvement in pre-metastatic niche formation, tissue metastasis, and immune modulation. Specifically, we discuss the roles of exosome-associated RNAs and proteins in NSCLC, and their contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we explore the potential of TEXs as biomarkers for NSCLC, emphasizing their application in diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies.",

In addition, we identified a novel post-translational modification of METTL3 and characterized specific regulatory mechanisms of METTL3 protein degradation. The E3 ligase TRIM21 mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination of METTL3 at the K459 site, leading to the proteasomal degradation of METTL3, which prevented tumor progression by promoting ferroptosis.

    "abstract": "Human oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is a prevalent form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), often presenting at an advanced stage with a grim prognosis. Traditional therapeutic approaches such as surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy have shown limited efficacy in treating advanced OTSCC, underscoring the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. Our bioinformatics analysis identified CD276 as a significant biomarker in OTSCC, with high protein expression levels correlating to a markedly reduced survival rate in late-stage patients. This discovery has led us to develop chimeric antigen receptor-natural killer (CAR-NK) cells derived from umbilical cord blood cells (UCBCs), specifically targeting CD276. Our aim is to investigate this novel therapeutic approach for its potential to combat OTSCC under pre-clinical conditions. Our in vitro and ex vivo studies have demonstrated that CD276-targeted CAR-NK cells exhibit remarkable efficacy in lysing OTSCC cell lines and primary cells, as well as in eliminating OTSCC organoids. These promising results underscore the pivotal role of CD276 in OTSCC pathogenesis and highlight the potential of CAR-NK cell therapy as a groundbreaking treatment option for advanced-stage OTSCC, offering new hope for translational medicine in the field of stomatology.",

    "abstract": "Local immunotherapy stimulates immune responses against tumors while avoiding adverse effects associated with systemic administration. However, current strategies for tumor-targeted in situ immunotherapy are still limited. mRNA-based gene therapy represents a promising strategy. Gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis is reported to exert anti-tumor immunity. Here, we synthetized mRNA encoding GSDME encapsulated by lipid nanoparticles (LNP-Gsdme). In situ delivery of LNP-Gsdme through intratumoral injection suppressed tumor growth, boosted monocyte infiltration and activated CD8+T cells. LNP-Gsdme induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumor cells, releasing creatine as a metabolic damage-associated molecular pattern. Creatine elicited cGAMP-STING-type I interferon signaling pathway in monocytes and reprogrammed intratumoral monocytes toward an immunostimulatory phenotype, consequently potentiating CD8+T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, creatine supplementation enhanced the antitumor efficacy of LNP-Gsdme. Our study uncovers creatine as an important metabolic biomarker of pyroptosis-induced ICD in tumors, providing new insights and a promising therapeutic approach for in vivo mRNA-based immunotherapies for cancer.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype characterized with poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. Although traditional chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection remain the standard treatment options for TNBC, bispecific antibody-based immunotherapy is emerging as new strategy in TNBC treatment. Here, we found that the receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) was highly expressed in TNBC but minimally expressed in normal tissue. A bispecific ROR1-targeted CD3 T cell engager (TCE) was designed in IgG-based format with extended half-life. The expression of ROR1 in TNBC was detected by RT-qPCR and immunohistology analysis. The killing of ROR1/CD3 antibody on TNBC cells was determined by the in vitro cytotoxicity assay and in vivo PBMC reconstituted mouse model. The activation of ROR1/CD3 on T cells was analyzed by the flow cytometry and ELISA assay. Pharmacokinetics study of ROR1/CD3 was performed in mouse. The ROR1/CD3 TCE triggered T cell activation and proliferation, which showed potent and specific killing to TNBC cells in ROR1-depedent manner. In vivo mouse model indicated that ROR1/CD3 TCE redirected the cytotoxic activity of T cells to lyse TNBC cells and induced significant tumor regression. Additionally, the ROR1/CD3 bispecific antibody exhibited an extended half-life in mouse, which may enable intermittent administration in clinic. Collectively, these results demonstrated that ROR1/CD3 TCE has a promising efficacy profile in preclinical studies, which suggested it as a possible option for the treatment of ROR1-expressing TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in the field of immunotherapy for esophageal cancer in recent years, only a minority of patients respond to these treatments, and effective predictive biomarkers remain elusive. Biomarkers such as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) are pivotal in guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. This study aimed to explore the correlation between the three biomarkers in patients with esophageal carcinoma. We collected one hundred esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor samples from patients who have been undergoing radical resection of esophageal carcinoma. Each tissue sample was divided into two parts for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemical staining. Mutations were identified using the NGS database, and TMB was calculated. Multiplex PCR targeting five loci (NR21, NR24, NR27, BAT25, and BAT26) was used to evaluate MSI. PD-L1 expression was determined through immunohistochemical analysis. Among the 100 ESCC patients, 54% (54/100) exhibited positive PD-L1 expression, 57% (57/100) demonstrated high TMB (TMB-H), and only 1% (1/100) had high MSI (MSI-H). Within the subset of TMB-H cases, 32 showed positive PD-L1 expression, with a single case displaying high expression of all three biomarkers, and 21 cases displaying low expression of all three biomarkers. There was no statistical association between PD-L1 expression levels and TMB. Further analysis showed a significant correlation between TNM staging and PD-L1 expression levels in ESCC tissues, with higher positive rates of PD-L1 expression observed in advanced stages. Similarly, a significant relationship was observed between TMB and lymph node metastasis. Based on our preliminary results, TMB and PD-L1 can serve as potential early screening clinical biomarkers and molecular targets for immune treatment in ESCC. However, there is no apparent statistical association between TMB and PD-L1 expression levels. Furthermore, PD-L1 and TMB may independently influence the efficacy of immunotherapy, highlighting the inadequacy of single-marker detection in effectively predicting treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have transformed cancer treatment by providing highly targeted and effective therapies that specifically attack cancer cells, thus reducing the likelihood of adverse events (AEs) in patients. mAbs exert their action through various mechanisms, such as receptor blockade, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and inhibition of immune checkpoints (eg, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4). These therapies have led to significant improvements in the treatment of several cancers, including HER2-positive breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and melanoma. The efficacy of mAb therapy in cancer treatment is influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as environmental exposures, psychosocial factors, infection status, ways of life, and tumor microenvironment (TME), all of which can impact immune responses and treatment outcomes. Notably, the therapeutic benefits of mAbs are often accompanied by immune-related AEs (irAEs), which can vary from mild to severe and affect multiple organ systems. The dual nature of mAbs-stimulating antitumor immune responses while also inducing immune-related side effects-presents a notable challenge in clinical practice. This review highlights the importance of proactive strategies for managing irAEs, such as early detection, corticosteroid use, targeted immunosuppressive treatments, and the urgent need for reliable predictive biomarkers to improve treatment outcomes. Advancements in the prevention, prediction, and management of irAEs are essential to enhance the safety and effectiveness of mAb-based therapies, ultimately aiming to improve cancer patient outcomes.",

The 9th edition of the TNM classification emphasizes distinguishing between single-station and multi-station N2 disease, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive mediastinal node assessment for clinical staging. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a minimally invasive modality used for nodal staging and diagnosis of lung cancer, offering a diagnostic yield comparable to that of mediastinoscopy when performed by experts. Additionally, EBUS-TBNA facilitates essential ancillary testing, including next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based biomarker panels and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, which are critical for evaluating the suitability of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Notably, advancements in perioperative management, such as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies with immunotherapy and targeted agents, have improved the outcomes of locally advanced diseases. EBUS-TBNA helps identify patients with early-stage lung cancer who are candidates for perioperative therapy.

Contemporary approaches address these gaps by incorporating biomarkers, pharmacokinetic profiling, and patient-reported outcomes to guide personalized dosing strategies. Such methods improve the precision of dose selection and promote individualized cancer care. This review underscores the importance of distinguishing between dose-finding and dose optimization, advocating for designs that integrate patient perspectives and pharmacologic insights from early-phase trials.

Identifying new therapeutic targets is key to addressing this challenge because it can both diversify and enhance existing treatment options, particularly through combination regimens. The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor involved in various biological processes. It is aberrantly activated in several aggressive cancer types, including breast cancer. Clinically, high CREB expression is associated with increased breast tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Functionally, CREB promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, as well as therapy resistance by deregulating genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and metabolism. Targeting CREB with small molecule inhibitors has demonstrated promise in preclinical studies. This review summarizes the current understanding of CREB mechanisms and their potential as a therapeutic target. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a master regulator of multiple biological processes, including neurodevelopment, metabolic regulation, and immune response. CREB is a putative proto-oncogene in breast cancer that regulates the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular migration. Preclinical development of CREB-targeting small molecules is underway.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Even though there has been progress in cancer immunotherapy, the results of applying immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been unsatisfactory, especially in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. Single-agent ICIs that target programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/ PD-L1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), T cell Ig- and mucin-domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3), and lymphocyte activation gene (LAG)-3 have emerged as having specific benefits. However, many primary and secondary resistance mechanisms are available in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that prevent it from happening. Combination strategies, such as the use of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, can be effective in overcoming these resistance pathways, but toxicities remain a significant concern. Moreover, ICIs have been integrated with various treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, antibiotics, virotherapy, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors. The outcomes observed in both preclinical and clinical settings have been encouraging. Interestingly, manipulating gut microbiota via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been identified as a new strategy to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in CRC patients. Therefore, integrating ICIs with other treatment approaches holds promise in enhancing the prognosis of CRC patients. This review focuses on the unmet need for new biomarkers to select patients for combination therapies and the ongoing work to overcome resistance and immune checkpoint blockade.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, particularly due to advanced-stage metastasis. P-cadherin (CDH3), a potential therapeutic target, is highly expressed in CRC tissues and associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying its role in CRC progression and its translational potential remain poorly understood. This study integrated multiple public databases (TCGA, HCMDB, UALCAN, HPA, UniProt, cBioPortal, and GEO) to evaluate CDH3 expression, construct a prognostic model, and perform functional and translational analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate CDH3 protein expression in clinical samples. Additional analyses included correlations with clinicopathological parameters, immune infiltration (TIDE, TISIDB), functional enrichment (KEGG, GSEA), drug sensitivity (GSCA), and molecular docking (MOE). Single-cell sequencing (CancerSEA, HPA) was also conducted to explore CDH3's role at the single-cell level. CDH3 expression was significantly elevated in CRC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis, recurrence, and metastasis. CDH3 expression was associated with the infiltration of resting immune cells, particularly dendritic cells, and enrichment analysis revealed its critical role in CRC metastasis through extracellular matrix (ECM) and local adhesion pathways. Notably, afatinib emerged as a promising candidate for targeting CDH3 via \"drug repositioning,\" a process involving the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications. This study provides novel insights into CDH3's role in CRC metastasis and its potential as a therapeutic target. The translational potential of CDH3, including its integration with immunotherapy and drug repositioning strategies, offers a promising avenue for the treatment of metastatic CRC.",

    "abstract": "ERCC3, a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, is implicated in the development and progression of various cancers and is a potential indicator of poor prognosis. However, the expression and function of ERCC3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression of ERCC3 in HCC tissues and its clinical significance, focusing on elucidating its potential mechanisms and therapeutic value in immunotherapy. The differential expression and genetic variation characteristics of ERCC3 across various cancers were evaluated using the TCGA database. The expression and prognostic value of ERCC3 in HCC were analyzed by integrating TCGA, GEO, and ICGC datasets. Independent prognostic value of ERCC3 expression levels in HCC was assessed using Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, and nomograms. Pathway association scores were determined using ssGSEA to reveal the biological functions of ERCC3 in HCC and its potential clinical efficacy in immunotherapy. Stable transient cell lines were established by infecting HepG2 cells with lentivirus overexpressing ERCC3. The effects of ERCC3 on HCC cell biological phenotypes were evaluated using RTCA, wound healing, and Transwell assays. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Transcriptome sequencing was performed to explore the impact of ERCC3 overexpression on the expression of signaling pathway-related genes in HCC. The study revealed that ERCC3 is aberrantly expressed in various tumors, with significantly higher mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues. High ERCC3 expression was significantly correlated with poor survival outcomes in HCC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ERCC3 expression level is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.014). Gene sets associated with the high ERCC3 group were significantly involved in multiple immune pathways and tumor progression-related pathways, and ERCC3 expression was significantly correlated with immune checkpoints in HCC. Overexpression of ERCC3 promoted the proliferation and migration of HCC cells and influenced cell cycle progression. Transcriptome sequencing analysis indicated that ERCC3 overexpression regulated the proliferation of HCC cells, participated in multiple pro-inflammatory pathways, induced the formation of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment, and promoted HCC progression. This study is the first to reveal the association between high ERCC3 expression and poor prognosis in HCC and to elucidate its immunomodulatory role in HCC. Unlike previous studies, we found that ERCC3 promotes HCC progression by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment and immune checkpoints. These findings establish a novel theoretical foundation for the development of targeted immunotherapies for HCC and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ERCC3's role in HCC.",

These antibodies target molecules such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) which normally function to limit immune activity. Treatment with ICIs reactivates T\u00a0cells to destroy tumor cells in a highly specific manner, which in some patients, results in dramatic remissions and durable disease control. Over the last decade, much effort has been directed at characterizing factors that drive efficacy and resistance to ICI therapy. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biomarkers for ICI therapy have facilitated more judicious treatment of cancer patients and transformed the field of precision oncology. Yet, adaptive immunity against cancers is complex, and newer data have revealed the potential utility of other biomarkers. In this review, we discuss the utility of currently approved biomarkers and highlight how emerging biomarkers can further improve the identification of patients who benefit from ICIs.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells play critical roles in tumor immunity, with Tregs suppressing immune responses and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Neuritin-1 (Nrn), a neuropeptide, has been identified to enhance Treg expansion. However, its role in T cell biology and tumor development remains unclear. We demonstrated that Nrn is highly expressed in the in-vitro-induced Tregs (iTregs). Functionally, Nrn promoted iTreg differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, while Nrn deletion or anti-Nrn antibody treatment significantly inhibited iTreg differentiation. Additionally, Nrn suppressed IL-2 transcription and secretion in T cells, impairing T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Treg-specific Nrn knockout mice exhibited reduced B16 melanoma tumor growth, decreased Treg infiltration, and increased effector T cell infiltration. Conversely, overexpression of Nrn accelerated B16 melanoma tumor progression by enhancing Treg-mediated suppression. Importantly, we developed the first anti-Nrn antibody, which effectively reduced tumour growth, decreased Treg infiltration, and enhanced effector T-cell activity. Importantly, anti-Nrn synergistically worked with anti-PD1 and improved the anti-PD1 response by reducing Tregs and increasing effector function in tumor-infiltrated T cells, resulting in enhanced tumor regression. Our findings identify Nrn as a critical regulator of Treg differentiation and effector T cell suppression, contributing to tumor progression. Targeting Nrn alone or combined with anti-PD1 therapy represents a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are dynamic complexes at the ends of chromosomes that are made up of protective proteins and tandem repeating DNA sequences. In the large majority of cancer cells, telomere length is maintained by telomerase, an enzyme that elongates telomeres. Telomerase activation is seen in the majority of cancer, which permits uncontrol cell proliferation. About 90% of human malignancies show telomere dysfunction and telomerase reactivation; as a result, telomerase activation plays a special role as a practically universal stage on the way to malignancy. This review understands the structural and functional of telomere and telomerase, mechanisms of telomerase activation in oncogenesis, biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Therapeutic strategies targeting telomerase, including antisense oligonucleotides, G-quadruplex stabilizers, immunotherapy, small-molecule inhibitors, gene therapy, Telomerase-Responsive Drug Release System, have shown promise in preclinical and clinical settings. Advances in telomere biology not only illuminate the complex interplay between telomeres, telomerase, and cancer progression but also open avenues for innovative, targeted cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibition is a major component in today's cancer immunotherapy. In recent years, the FDA has approved a number of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of melanoma, non-small-cell lung, breast and gastrointestinal cancers. These inhibitors, which target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, programmed cell death (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) checkpoints have assumed a leading role in immunotherapy. The same inhibitors exert significant antitumor effects by overcoming tumor cell immune evasion and reversing T-cell exhaustion. The initial impact of this therapy in cancer treatment was justly described as revolutionary, however, clinical as well as research data which followed demonstrated that these innovative drugs are costly, are associated with potentially severe adverse effects, and only benefit a small subset of patients. These limitations encouraged enhanced research and clinical efforts to identify predictive biomarkers to stratify patients who are most likely to benefit from this form of therapy. The discovery and characterization of this class of biomarkers is pivotal in guiding individualized treatment against various forms of cancer. Currently, there are three FDA-approved predictive biomarkers, however, none of which on its own can deliver a reliable and precise response to immune therapy. Present literature identifies the absence of precise predictive biomarkers and poor understanding of the mechanisms behind tumor resistance as the main obstacles facing ICIs immunotherapy. In the present text, we discuss the dual role of PD-L1 as a biomarker for response to immunotherapy and as an immune checkpoint. The contribution of mass spectrometry-based analysis, particularly the impact of protein post-translational modifications on the performance of this protein is underlined.",

Aberrant AS influences antigen presentation, T cell activation, immune checkpoint regulation, and cytokine signaling, contributing to immune evasion but also presenting unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Targeting AS has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Splicing-derived neoantigens have been identified as potent inducers of CD8\u207a T cell responses, offering potential for personalized treatment. AS modulators such as PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3326595 enhance immunotherapy efficacy by upregulating MHC class II expression and promoting T cell infiltration, while RBM39 inhibitor indisulam induces tumor-specific neoantigens. Furthermore, combining AS-targeting drugs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has demonstrated synergistic effects, improved response rates and overcoming resistance in preclinical models. Despite these advances, challenges remain in optimizing drug specificity and minimizing toxicity. Future efforts should focus on refining AS-targeting therapies, identifying predictive biomarkers, and integrating these approaches into clinical applications.

    "abstract": "Programmed Cell death (PCD) encompasses a spectrum of genetically regulated cell death processes and plays a double-edged sword role in neoplastic progression and therapeutic resistance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer(TNBC)through the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the specific mechanisms by which PCD mediates microenvironmental dysregulation remain elusive. Analyzing nine samples of TNBC through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), this study employed nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to assess genes associated with 13 PCD modes. Single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC), Monocle, CellChat, and scMetabolism were used for pseudotime analysis, intercellular communication mapping, determination of transcription factor activities (TFs), and immune infiltration of PCD-related cell clusters in TME. A robust prognostic model and drug resistance analysis were constructed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariable Cox regression. Finally, hub genes and critical PCD-related cell clusters were validated in the clinical breast cancer samples and the TNBC model mice. This investigation demonstrated that PCD significantly modulated the functional and phenotypic diversity of fibroblasts, macrophages, T cells, and B cells in the TME of TNBC. Furthermore, this study revealed that PCD-regulated CEBPB-positive cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) populations are a key determinant of the TNBC immune Microenvironment heterogeneity and poor prognosis. Notably, CellChat analysis unveiled diverse and extensive interactions between PCD-related cell clusters and tumor immune cells, highlighting the CEBPB+ CAF subtype as a signaling ligand communicated with other immune cell clusters through the Midkine (MDK)-Nucleolin (NCL) signaling axis. Moreover, the TIDE analysis verified that CEBPB+ CAF is a predictor of poor prognosis in Immunotherapy. The ex vivo analyses of tumor specimens from both TNBC patients and syngeneic murine models were performed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), immunoblotting, immunohistochemical staining, and multiplexed immunofluorescence co-localization assays. They confirmed differential expression of the PCD-related prognostic genes and the presence of CEBPB+ CAFs. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive molecular framework to understand the role of PCD-mediated TME dysregulation in TNBC pathogenesis. This study also offers new insights into the underlying mechanisms of immune therapy resistance in TNBC and identifies promising therapeutic targets for enhancing treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.",

This review discusses the complex molecular pathogenesis of ACC, focusing on critical pathways implicated in the tumorigenesis and providing potential targets for therapy: the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, the IGF2/IGF1R axis, and the apoptosis pathway regulated by p53. Current treatment strategies include surgical resection and mitotane, the sole adrenolytic agent approved by the FDA; however, its effects in advanced disease are suboptimal. Cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with mitotane may be applied, but survival benefits are limited so far.

We also emphasize the possible role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the management of ACC, although their effectiveness is still under study. Upcoming trends in treatment involve forms of personalized medicine, where molecular profiling is integrated to identify actionable biomarkers for administered therapies.

However, the role of TRAF2 expression in epigenetic, cancer prognosis, and immune responses in tumor microenvironment is unclear. We used The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, TIMER 2.0 database, and TCGA database to evaluate TRAF2 expression in human normal and tumor tissues. Correlation of TRAF2 expression with mutations and epigenetic in tumors was evaluated using the cBioPortal platform and the GSCA database. To assess the prognostic value of TRAF2, we performed Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression analysis. LinkedOmics database was used for PANTHER Pathways enrichment analysis. The relationship between TRAF2 expression and immune checkpoint genes, as well as immune cell infiltration, was examined using TIMER 2.0 and the R language. Single-cell sequencing data and multiple immunofluorescence staining were used to observe the co-expression of TRAF2 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and immune cells. Furthermore, using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we explored the potential role of TRAF2 in liver cancer cell biology. Our findings indicate that TRAF2 is frequently mutated and significantly overexpressed in various types of cancers, and this overexpression is linked to a poor prognosis. The epigenetic alterations in TRAF2 was significant across various types of cancers. TRAF2 is associated with the levels of various immune checkpoint genes and multiple tumor-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting its potential involvement in tumor microenvironment. Of note, enrichment analysis revealed a significant correlation between TRAF2 and T cell activation, and single-cell sequencing indicated that TRAF2 was overexpressed in malignant cells and T cells.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a fatal malignant tumor of the digestive system, and immunotherapy has currently emerged as a key therapeutic approach for treating PAAD, with its efficacy closely linked to T-cell subsets and the tumor immune microenvironment. However, reliable predictive markers to guide clinical immunotherapy for PAAD are not available. We analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data focused on PAAD from the GeneExpressionOmnibus (GEO) database. Then, the information from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was integrated to develop and validate a prognostic risk model derived from T-cell marker genes. Subsequently, the correlation between these risk models and the effectiveness of immunotherapy was explored. Analysis of scRNA-seq data uncovered six T-cell subtypes and 1837 T-cell differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Combining these data with the TCGA dataset, we constructed a T-cell prognostic risk model containing 16 DEGs, which can effectively predict patient survival and immunotherapy outcomes. We have found that patients in the low-risk group had better prognostic outcomes, increased immune cell infiltration, and signs of immune activation compared to those in the high-risk group. Additionally, analysis of tumor mutation burden showed higher mutation rates in patients with PAAD in the high-risk group. Risk scores with immune checkpoint gene expression and drug sensitivity analysis provide patients with multiple therapeutic targets and drug options. Our study constructed a prognostic risk model for PAAD patients based on T-cell marker genes, providing valuable insights into predicting patient prognosis and the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant liver tumor in children under five years of age. Although globally rare, it accounts for a large proportion of liver cancer in children and has poor survival rates in high-risk and metastatic cases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic strategies of HB. Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene and the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway are essential genetic factors. Furthermore, genetic syndromes like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) considerably heighten the risk of associated conditions. Additionally, epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and the influence of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are pivotal drivers of tumor development. Diagnostics include serum biomarkers, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and imaging techniques. Standard treatments are chemotherapy, surgical resection, and liver transplantation (LT). Emerging therapies like immunotherapy and targeted treatments offer hope against chemotherapy resistance. Future research will prioritize personalized medicine, novel biomarkers, and molecular-targeted therapies to improve survival outcomes.",

Standard therapies, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, offer limited survival benefits and carry significant toxicities, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. CYP2W1, a tumor-specific monooxygenase enzyme, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its aberrant expression in various cancers. However, its role in pediatric STSs remains poorly understood. This study evaluated CYP2W1 expression in 42 pediatric STS samples across seven histological subtypes using qPCR and Western blot analyses.

    "abstract": "ER stress has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy. RNA sequencing data of patients with THCA were obtained from the TCGA database to identify differentially expressed genes associated with ER stress. Signature genes were selected through univariate Cox regression, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The predictive performance of the model was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and ROC curves. GSEA was conducted to explore pathway enrichment between high-risk and low-risk groups. The immune landscape of risk groups was characterized using ssGSEA, ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to investigate the mRNA expression of the signature genes. Finally, immunotherapy response and potential drug sensitivity were evaluated. The prognostic model based on the signature genes ANK2, APOE, ERP27, FPR2, and NOS1, demonstrated robust predictive performance. GSEA results revealed distinct pathway enrichment patterns in the high-risk and low-risk groups. Furthermore, ssGSEA revealed that low-risk patients exhibited enhanced immune-related functions and increased immune cell infiltration. The RT-qPCR results revealed that in thyroid cancer cells, APOE and ERP27 expression levels were elevated, and ANK1, NOS1, and FPR2 expression levels were decreased. Immunotherapy, as well as Palbociclib and Perifosine, were predicted to be more effective for low-risk patients. Conversely, high-risk patients were more likely to benefit from Axitinib, Imatinib, Nilotinib, and Temsirolimus. This study identified 5 signature genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for THCA. These findings provide novel insights into the prognosis and targeted therapy of THCA, offering a foundation for furture clinical applications.",

Consequently, the immunological function is essential to the growth of this malignancy. Tumor immunotherapy has yielded several encouraging outcomes, but despite this, different patients continue to not respond to treatment, and a far larger number become resistant to it. Also, activated CAR-T cells express a majority of immunological checkpoint factors, containing PD1, CTLA4, and LAG3, which counteracts the anti-tumor actions of CAR-T cells. Moreover, cytokine release syndrome is one of the possible adverse responses of CAR-T cell therapy. Therefore, producing universal allogeneic T lymphocytes with potent anti-tumor activity is essential. This study demonstrates current research on this cutting-edge technology, including the composition and mode of action of CAR-NK and CAR-T cells in GC.

In this study, we extracted transcriptome and clinicopathological data for 179 PAAD samples from the TCGA database and evaluated the immune composition, stromal composition, and infiltrating immune cell landscape in the tumor samples. Then, we identified relevant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performed functional annotation and prognostic correlation analysis to identify prognostic biomarkers for pancreatic cancer, the correlation between biomarkers and tumor immune invasion was analyzed to reveal the molecular immune mechanism of pancreatic cancer. Finally, GEO databases (GES71729), GEPIA, TISIDB, TIMER databases and RT-PCR were used for further analysis. CXCL10 and CXCL11 were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and associated with poor prognosis of patients through cell adhesion molecules chemokine signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Finally, the correlation between CXCL10 and CXCL11 and tumor immune invasion was analyzed. The results confirmed that the expression levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 were positively correlated with the contents of CD8 Our study demonstrates that CXCL10 and CXCL11 are novel biomarkers of TME and immune cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer by affecting the distribution of immune cells.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and fatal tumor globally, characterized by a complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Despite significant advancements in the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for cancer treatment, the efficacy of immunotherapy in HCC remains suboptimal. PSMD2, a crucial regulator of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, has attracted increasing attention for its involvement in various cancers; however, its functions and mechanisms in HCC are still poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the expression of PSMD2 in HCC, its association with prognosis, and its interaction with immune checkpoints, thus establishing a foundation for further exploration of its role in immune evasion in HCC. We analyzed the expression levels of PSMD2 in HCC and adjacent normal tissues utilizing the GEPIA and TIMER databases. Cox regression analysis was performed using R software to evaluate the relationship between PSMD2 expression and prognosis. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between PSMD2 and immune cell infiltration, as well as immune checkpoints, including PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, using R tools. Additionally, we examined the association between PSMD2 expression and immune therapy response through Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) analysis. Finally, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the STRING database and Cytoscape software, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). PSMD2 was significantly overexpressed in HCC and was closely correlated with poor prognosis (HR\u2009=\u20091.61, P\u2009=\u20092.0e-4). Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated that PSMD2 was positively correlated with several immune checkpoint genes, including PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, as well as various immune cell types. TIDE analysis indicated that elevated PSMD2 expression was significantly associated with increased immune evasion potential and a poor response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, GSEA enrichment analysis revealed that PSMD2 is primarily enriched in the p53 signaling pathway, the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, and other cancer-related pathways. The elevated expression of PSMD2 in HCC is not only correlated with poor prognosis but may also play a role in immune evasion by modulating tumor immunity, thereby affecting patient responses to immunotherapy. Consequently, PSMD2 presents a promising novel therapeutic target and potential biomarker for immunotherapy in HCC.",

However, a pan-cancer analysis of PDGFRB has not yet been carried out. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases were utilized to analyze PDGFRB expression levels. Differential expression of PDGFRB in standard, tumor, and different clinical stage samples was calculated using R software (version 3.6.4). Immunohistochemical staining for Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) and Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) was conducted on clinical patient samples. High-quality prognostic datasets from TCGA have been published in previous studies. Additionally, the TARGET follow-up data were obtained as supplementary information, excluding models with a follow-up period of less than 30 days. After conducting a rain analysis of PDGFRB, Kaplan-Meier and univariate Cox regression analyses were performed using the R software package. The DNA tumor stemness scores, derived from methylation signatures for each tumor, were obtained from previous studies. Finally, the infiltration of immune cells was analyzed, and the Pearson correlation between PDGFRB and five immune pathway marker genes was assessed. PDGFRB exhibited differential expression across most tumor types in TCGA, indicating a correlation with poor survival outcomes. The expression of PDGFRB influences the regulation of the immune system and is closely associated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoints, immune-activating genes, immune suppressor genes, chemokines, and chemokine receptors.

The frequency and activity of cytotoxic T cells within tumors and their tumor microenvironment (TME) are now well-established prognostic and predictive biomarkers for numerous tumor types. However, it is well-known that various tumor treatment modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, modulate not only the immunogenicity of the tumor but also the immune system itself. Consequently, the interaction between tumor cells and T cells requires more intensive study in different therapeutic contexts to fully understand the complex role of T cells during tumor therapy. To address this need, a protocol was developed to analyze the activity and proliferative capacity of human cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells in co-culture with pre-treated tumor cells. Specifically, CD8+ T cells from healthy donors are stained with the non-toxic proliferation marker carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and stimulated using CD3/CD28-coated plates. Subsequently, T cells are co-cultured with pre-treated tumor cells. As a readout, T cell proliferation is quantified by measuring CFSE signal distribution and assessing the expression of surface activation markers via flow cytometry. This can be further complemented by quantifying cytokine release using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This method facilitates the evaluation of treatment-induced changes in the interaction between tumor cells and T cells, providing a foundation for more detailed analyses of tumor treatment modalities and their immunogenicity in a human ex vivo setting. Additionally, it contributes to the reduction of pre-clinical in vivo analyses.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the identification of molecular biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies have enhanced the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Several established biomarkers have been widely integrated into routine clinical diagnostics of gastric cancer to guide personalized treatment. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was the first molecular biomarker to be used in gastric cancer with trastuzumab being the first approved targeted therapy for HER2-positive gastric cancer. Programmed death-ligand 1 positivity and microsatellite instability can guide the use of immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab. More recently, zolbetuximab has been approved for patients with claudin 18.2-positive diseases in some countries. More targeted therapies, including savolitinib for MET-positive patients, are currently under clinical investigation. However, the clinical application of these diagnostic approaches could be hampered by many existing challenges, including invasive and costly sampling methods, variability in immunohistochemistry interpretation, high costs and long turnaround times for next-generation sequencing, the absence of standardized and clinically validated diagnostic cut-off values for some biomarkers, and tumor heterogeneity. Novel testing and analysis techniques, such as artificial intelligence-assisted image analysis and multiplex immunohistochemistry, and emerging therapeutic strategies, including combination therapies that integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies, offer potential solutions to some of these challenges.

    "abstract": "The cap-binding complex (CBC) plays a crucial role in facilitating gene expression by safeguarding mRNA from nonsense-mediated decay, promoting mRNA splicing, 3'-end processing, and facilitating nuclear export. Nevertheless, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of CBC in cancer remain ambiguous, necessitating further investigation for clarification. The present study utilized the cBioPortal database to investigate the genetic alterations of nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2 (NCBP2) in pan-cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and online web tools were employed to analyze the correlation between NCBP2 and prognosis, genome instability, immune infiltration, immune response, cancer stemness, and chemotherapeutic efficacy in pan-cancer. Furthermore, the expression of NCBP2 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and functional analysis at the single-cell level was conducted using the CancerSEA database. In this study, we revealed the correlation of NCBP2 with prognosis, microenvironment and stemness, indicating that NCBP2 might be a potential therapeutic target for more effective and personalized therapy strategies in pan-cancer.",

    "abstract": "CXCR1/2 inhibitors are being implemented with immunotherapies in PDAC clinical trials. CXC-ligands are a family of cytokines responsible for stimulating these receptors; while typically secreted by activated immune cells, fibroblasts, and even adipocytes, they are also secreted by immune-evasive cancer cells. CXC-ligand release is known to occur in response to inflammatory stimuli. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ and a source of inflammatory signaling peptides. Importantly, adipose-derived cytokines and chemokines are implicated as potential drivers of tumor cell immune evasion; cumulatively, these findings suggest that targeting CXC-ligands may be beneficial in the context of obesity. RNA-sequencing of human PDAC cell lines was used to assess influences of adipose conditioned media on the cancer cell transcriptome. The adipose-induced secretome of PDAC cells was validated with ELISA for induction of CXCL5 secretion. Human tissue data from CPTAC was used to correlate IL-1\u03b2 and TNF expression with both CXCL5 mRNA and protein levels. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout CXCL5 from a murine PDAC KPC cell line to assess orthotopic tumor studies in syngeneic, diet-induced obese mice. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the immune profiles between tumors with or without CXCL5. Mice-bearing CXCL5 competent or deficient tumors were monitored for differential tumor size in response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Human adipose tissue conditioned media stimulates CXCL5 secretion from PDAC cells via either IL-1\u03b2 or TNF; neutralization of both is required to significantly block the release of CXCL5 from tumor cells. Ablation of CXCL5 from tumors promoted an enriched immune phenotype with an unanticipatedly increased number of exhausted CD8 T cells. Application of anti-PD-1 treatment to control tumors failed to alter tumor growth, yet treatment of CXCL5-deficient tumors showed response by significantly diminished tumor mass. In summary, our findings show that both TNF and IL-1\u03b2 can stimulate CXCL5 release from PDAC cells in vitro, which correlates with expression in patient data. CXCL5 depletion ",

    "abstract": "Brain metastases remain a major clinical challenge due to their high resistance to conventional and targeted therapies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are the most common cellular component of the brain metastases tumor microenvironment. They significantly impact the tumor microenvironment because they promote cancer cell invasion, enhance metastasis, boost immune evasion, and contribute to drug resistance. We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases and included 99 studies to summarize the present review. Based on the searched articles, the present review emphasizes that biomarkers including PDGFR-\u03b2, \u03b1-SMA, and collagen I can identify metastatic brain cancer-associated fibroblasts, which lead to a poor prognosis and recurrence. In addition, cancer-associated fibroblasts can cause resistance to therapy by modifying the extracellular matrix (e.g., collagen I, fibronectin), secreting growth factors (e.g., TGF-\u03b2, HGF, IL-6), causing immunological evasion (e.g., Tregs, MDSCs), secreting exosomes (e.g., miRNAs), metabolic reprogramming, stemness induction, and plasticity. We also describe the molecular mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblasts confer drug resistance in brain metastases, such as extracellular matrix restoration, immunological evasion, metabolic reprogramming, etc. We also cover prospective therapeutic options for overcoming medication resistance, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts depletion, paracrine signaling blockage, metabolic inhibitors, and cancer-associated fibroblasts-targeted immunotherapies. Targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts in addition to existing medications may improve cancer treatment efficacy and survival rates for individuals with brain metastases. However, more research is required to better understand their role in metastatic brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with the Cell Division Cycle 7 (CDC7) protein emerging as a potential therapeutic target due to its critical role in tumor proliferation, survival, and resistance. However, a comprehensive analysis of CDC7 across multiple cancers is lacking, and existing therapeutic options have come with limited clinical success. The aim of this is to integrate a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of CDC7 with the identification of novel marine-derived inhibitors, bridging the understanding of CDC7's role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across diverse cancer types. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of CDC7 across 33 tumor types using publicly available datasets to evaluate its expression, genetic alterations, immune interactions, survival, and prognostic significance. Additionally, a marine-derived compound library of 31,492 molecules was screened to identify potential CDC7 inhibitors using chemoinformatics and machine learning. The top candidates underwent rigorous evaluations, including molecular docking, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The findings revealed that CDC7 is overexpressed in several cancers and is associated with poor survival outcomes and unfavorable prognosis. Enrichment analysis linked CDC7 to critical DNA replication pathways, while its role in modulating tumor-immune interactions highlighted its potential as a target for immunotherapy. Among all tested compounds, Tetrahydroaltersolanol D (CMNPD21999) exhibited the strongest binding affinity and stability, along with better drug-likeness and zero toxicity. These attributes highlight its potential as a promising drug candidate for CDC7 inhibition and future cancer treatment development. Furthermore, additional in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm the effectiveness of this drug candidate against the CDC7 protein.",

    "abstract": "Plant-made PD1-Fc fusions engineered for optimized glycosylation and Fc-receptor engagement are highly efficient in blocking PD1/PDL1 interactions and can be cost-effective alternatives to antibody-based immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies to receptors that have pivotal roles during T-cell activation processes. The programmed cell death 1 (PD1) can be regarded as the primary immune checkpoint and antibodies targeting PD1 or its ligand PDL1 have revolutionized immunotherapy of cancer. However, the majority of patients fail to respond, and treatment resistance as well as immune-related adverse events are commonly associated with this therapy. Alternatives to antibody-based ICIs targeting the PD1 pathway may bear the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings. Here, we have used a plant expression platform based on the tobacco relative Nicotiana benthamiana to generate immunoglobulin fusion proteins harboring the wild type or an affinity-enhanced PD1 ectodomain. We have exploited the versatility of our system to generate variants that differed regarding their glycosylation profile as well as their capability to engage Fc-receptors. Unlike its wild-type counterpart, the affinity-enhanced versions showed strongly augmented capabilities to engage PDL1 in both protein- and cell-based assays. Moreover, in contrast with clinical antibodies, their binding is not affected by the glycosylation status of PDL1. Importantly, we could demonstrate that the plant-made PD1 fusion proteins are highly efficient in blocking inhibitory PD1 signaling in a T cell reporter assay. Taken together, our study highlights the utility of our plant-based protein expression platform to generate biologics with therapeutic potential. Targeting PDL1 with plant derived affinity-enhanced PD1 immunoglobulin fusion proteins may reduce overstimulation associated with antibody-based therapies while retaining favorable features of ICIs such as long serum half-life.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and very aggressive form of the disease that has few suitable treatment options; however, spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a powerful tool for elucidation of the TME in TNBC. Because of its spatial context preservation, ST has a unique capability to map tumor-stroma interactions, immune infiltration, and therapy resistance mechanisms (which are key to understanding TNBC progression), compared with conventional transcriptomics. This review shows the use of ST in TNBC, its utilization in spatial biomarker identification, intratumoral heterogeneity definition, molecular subtyping refinement, and prediction of immunotherapy responses. Recent insight from ST-driven insights has explained the key spatial patterns on immune evasion, chemotherapy resistance, racial disparities of TNBC, and aspects for patient stratification and therapeutic decision. With the integration of ST with the subjects of proteomics and imaging mass cytometry, this approach has been enlarged and is now applied in precision medicine and biomarker discovery. Recently, advancements in AI-based spatial analysis for tumor classification, identification of biomarkers, and creation of therapy prediction models have occurred. However, continued developments in ST technologies, computational tools, and partnerships amongst multiple centers to facilitate the integration of ST into clinical routine practice are needed to unlock novel therapeutic targets.",

In this case, report, we highlight the successful use of a lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) inhibitor, relatlimab, in combination with nivolumab (a programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitor) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in a kidney transplant recipient. The patient developed a complete metabolic response to therapy. LAG-3 expression was notably positive in the renal graft, but negative in the metastatic melanoma tumor tissue. Although the outcome resulted in rapid renal graft rejection, this underscores the need for further research into LAG-3's dual role in cancer therapy and allograft rejection in organ transplant recipients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of advanced stage melanoma and many other cancers. However, using ICIs in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) poses challenges due to the risk of the immune system rejecting the transplanted organ. A new ICI drug combination, relatlimab (targeting LAG-3) and nivolumab (targeting PD-1) was recently approved to treat advanced melanoma. We are the first to report a case of a kidney transplant patient with stage IV melanoma successfully treated with relatlimab and nivolumab leading to complete resolution of the metastatic disease in the lung, but resulted in kidney graft rejection. Interestingly, we identified LAG-3 protein expression in the kidney graft biopsy. This case highlights the ongoing research needed to effectively treat cancer and protect transplanted organs when using ICIs in OTRs.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy, leveraging the immune system to target and eradicate cancer cells, has transformed cancer treatment paradigms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used in a wide array of cancers, but only a limited fraction of patients are responding. Cancer vaccines could elicit antigen-specific immune responses and establish long-term immune memory, preventing recurrence and metastasis. Despite their promising profiles, ICIs and cancer vaccines by themselves are often insufficient to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and recurrence/metastasis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. The targeted liposomal formulation (TLIF), displaying Cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide on the surface and encapsulating ICG and thermoresistant flagellin (FlaB) inside, was used for photothermal therapy (PTT), which was designed to induce robust immunogenic cell death (ICD) and release tumor antigens (TAs). We employed a mouse breast cancer model amenable to PTT. Utilizing a bilateral DD-Her2/neu tumor implantation model, we evaluated local and abscopal effects of combinatorial approaches employing PTT, FlaB-adjuvanted peptide vaccine (FlaB-Vax), and anti-PD-1 treatment. FlaB-Vax was designed to trigger tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific immune responses, which will trigger specific anti-tumor immunity. TLIF-PTT aimed to reduce tumor burden and induce ICD-mediated TA liberation for epitope spreading. Sustained anti-tumor immune memory was assessed by orthotopic rechallenging cured mice with the DD-Her2/neu tumor cells. The combination of TLIF-PTT and FlaB-Vax provided significantly enhanced primary tumor suppression, with strong abscopal effects and long-lasting immune memory. The addition of anti-PD-1 therapy further improved long-term relapse-free survival, highlighting the potential of this combinatorial approach to induce durable antitumor immunity and sustainably prevent cancer recurrence and metastasis. This study demonstrates that the combination of TLIF-PTT and FlaB-Vax synergistically induced synergistic anti-tumor immune responses, which were efficaciously potentiated by anti-PD-1 treatment for recurrence-free long-term survival.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes with genotype-matched targeted therapy in solid cancer patients are heterogeneous: some have exceptional responses, whereas others have primary progression. This review explores the immunobiological features which may underlie this differential response. We conducted a literature review of studies assessing the impact of immune context following searches on Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Relevant outcomes include response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Data were extracted from multivariate analysis, univariate analysis or directly from Kaplan-Meier curves. Meta-analyses were carried out where three or more studies analysed the same immune factor for the same cancer type. The remaining studies were analysed descriptively. In the adjuvant setting, assessment of the immune context does not highlight a group failing to derive benefit for the use of dabrafenib/trametinib after resection of BRAFV600E melanoma. Differential gene expression in exceptional responders show enrichment of genes associated with immune activation. BRAFV600E colorectal cancer patients with high cytolytic scores benefit from the addition of MEK inhibition whereas those with low scores fare better without. High programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is predictive of inferior outcomes to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ALK and G12C tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant patients with high CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 positivity have very poor outcomes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes predict for efficacy of stromal-poor tumours in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer treated with short-course adjuvant trastuzumab. High immune metagene and single immune gene expression are predictive of benefit for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, but not chemotherapy alone. The addition of pertuzumab or lapatanib appears to be beneficial in those with immune non-enriched microenvironments. High major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I is negatively predictive and high MHC-II is positively predictive of outcomes with trastuzumab-based therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first review assessing immunological context as a biomarker for targeted therapy. The results of this review represent an important resource to aid future translational studies in advancing stratified precision medicine oncology.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains highly lethal, with a five-year survival rate below 15 %. Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as a novel potential therapeutic target in PDAC. Zolbetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CLDN18.2, has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in gastric cancers and is now in phase 2 clinical trials for PDAC. Trial eligibility for zolbetuximab requires tumor membranous immunohistochemical staining with the pan-claudin 18 companion diagnostic antibody clone 43-14A. However, the expression of CLDN18 detected using this clone has only been evaluated in 62 patients from a single retrospective study. Herein, we report immunohistochemical staining using 43-14A on surgically resected PDAC samples (n = 120). Samples were stained following the protocol used in clinical trials, using the 43-14A VENTANA antibody in a prediluted kit, and according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Positive cases were defined as \u2265 75 % of tumor cells exhibiting membranous staining with an intensity of \u2265\u20092+. Out of 120 PDAC cases, 39 (32.5 %) stained positive for CLDN18 with 43-14A. A significant association was observed between lower tumor grade and higher 43-14A staining (p < 0.05). CLDN18-positive cases demonstrated significantly improved survival at the cohort's median overall survival (23 months, p < 0.05), suggesting that claudin expression could serve as a both a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Our findings indicate that 32.5 % of PDAC tumors in this cohort are positive for CLDN18, suggesting that a significant proportion of patients with PDAC could benefit from zolbetuximab and other CLDN18.2 targeted immunotherapies if pancreatic cancer therapeutic trials prove successful.",

However, the predictive value of MACC1 levels for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) immunotherapy has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the predictive effect of the oncogene MACC1 on ICB reactivity in patients with LUAD. First, the expression patterns and clinical features of MACC1 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were comprehensively evaluated using R packages. We subsequently assessed the correlations between MACC1 and immunological characteristics in the LUAD tumor microenvironment (TME) using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The results revealed that MACC1 overexpression was significantly correlated with 3 immune checkpoints, 14 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), 9 immunomodulators, 5 anticancer immune process activities, and 3 effector genes of TIICs in LUAD. Additionally, on the basis of the prognostic genes from LASSO analysis, we developed the MACC1-related Risk Score (MRRS), which can accurately predict the prognosis and response to cancer immunotherapy in LUAD patients (HR\u2005=\u20053.50, AUC at 1, 2, and 3 years\u2005=\u20050.737, 0.744, and 0.724, respectively). Finally, in vivo experiments revealed that the combination of MACC1 silencing and PD-L1 inhibitors significantly inhibits tumor progression. These findings increase our understanding of MACC1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. The MRRS may play a critical role in predicting the response of LUAD patients to ICB therapy.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health issue, with poor prognosis often associated with dysregulated metabolic pathways, especially lactate metabolism. This study explored the prognostic significance of lactate-associated genes in HCC and their potential as therapeutic targets. We analyzed RNA-seq and clinical data from 374 patients with HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using Cox regression, LASSO analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, we identified key lactate-associated genes associated with patient outcomes. Functional validations, including Western blot, flow cytometry, and molecular docking studies, were performed to confirm the biological impact of these genes. G6PD, IK, and CALML5 were identified as significant prognostic markers for HCC. A prognostic model was developed that effectively stratified patients into risk groups, which correlated with survival. G6PD's role in immune modulation and its potential as a drug target were validated through biochemical assays and computational analyses. Functional assays in HepG2 cells confirmed that alterations in G6PD expression affect T cell activity, with knockdown enhancing IFN-\u03b3 production and overexpression inhibiting it, demonstrating G6PD's role in immune evasion. This study establishes lactate metabolism genes, particularly G6PD, as key prognostic markers in HCC. The validation of G6PD's immunomodulatory effects further supports its potential as a therapeutic target for strategies aimed at enhancing immune surveillance and treatment outcomes in HCC.",

    "title": "[FCN3 Can Serve as A Potential Biomarker for Prognosis and \u2029Immunotherapy of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma].",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is an important pathological subtype of NSCLC. The complex immune escape mechanism limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Ficolin-3 (FCN3) is a crucial immunomodulatory molecule that regulates immune escape by remodeling the tumor microenvironment. However, the role of FCN3 in LUSC remains unclear. This study employed bioinformatics methods to analyze LUSC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The aim of this study was to explore the potential biological functions and prognostic significance of FCN3 in LUSC. A pan-cancer analysis characterized the expression patterns and prognostic value of FCN3 across various cancer types. Simultaneously, the expression patterns of FCN3 in LUSC samples from the TCGA database and its relationship with prognosis were analyzed. The Nomogram model and somatic mutation analysis, differential expression analysis, correlation analysis, as well as Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were constructed to explore the potential mechanisms of FCN3. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis, immune escape score (TIDE), and correlation analysis of immune-related molecules were used to reveal the regulatory role of high FCN3 levels on immunity in LUSC. Furthermore, the correlation between FCN3 expression characteristics and drug sensitivity was evaluated. Finally, in vitro experiments verified the expression characteristics of FCN3 in LUSC. The expression level of FCN3 in LUSC tissues was significantly lower than that in normal tissues. Patients with high FCN3 expression in LUSC had a poorer prognosis compared to those with low expression. Different expression levels of FCN3 were associated with the abundance of immune cell infiltration and immune cell dysfunction. It was also linked to the expression of immune checkpoints, immune stimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class molecules, and chemotherapy drug sensitivity. High expression of FCN3 in LUSC is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration, immune-related pathways, and immune-related molecules. FCN3 may be a potential prognostic marker and a new target for immunotherapy in LUSC. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1aFCN3\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80ba\u9cde\u764c\u9884\u540e\u53ca\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u2029\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u662f\u5168\u7403\u764c\u75c7\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u80ba\u9cde\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u764c\uff08lung squamous cell carcinoma, LUSC\uff09\u662f\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4e9a\u578b\uff0c\u514d\u75ab\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002Ficolin-3\uff08FCN3\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u8c03\u8282\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u80bf\u7624\u514d\u75ab\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u9003\u9038\uff0c\u4f46FCN3\u5728LUSC\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u56fe\u8c31\uff08The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684LUSC\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8FCN3\u5728LUSC\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u6cdb\u764c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u5f81FCN3\u7684\u6cdb\u764c\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8eTCGA\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684LUSC\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790FCN3\u5728LUSC\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaNomogram\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u57fa\u56e0\u672c\u4f53\uff08Gene Ontology, GO\uff09\u3001\u4eac\u90fd\u57fa\u56e0\u4e0e\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66\uff08Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u96c6\u5bcc\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff08Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, GSEA\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22FCN3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u514d\u75ab\u6d78\u6da6\u5206\u6790\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u9003\u9038\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793aFCN3\u5728LUSC\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u5bf9\u514d\u75ab\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30FCN3\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u836f\u7269\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u4f53\u5916\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1FCN3\u5728LUSC\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7ed3\u679c FCN3\u5728LUSC\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6c34\u5e73\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbeFCN3\u7684LUSC\u60a3\u8005\u9884\u540e\u8f83\u5dee\u3002FCN3\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0e\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u6d78\u6da6\u4e30\u5ea6\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u6709\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u514d\u75ab\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3001\u514d\u75ab\u523a\u6fc0\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u590d\u5408\u4f53\uff08major histocompatibility complex, MHC\uff09\u7c7b\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u53ca\u5316\u7597\u836f\u7269\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba LUSC\u4e2dFCN3\u7684\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u4e0d\u826f\u9884\u540e\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14FCN3\u4e0e\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u6d78\u6da6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u514d\u75ab\u901a\u8def\u53ca\u514d\u75ab\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u5173\uff0cFCN3\u53ef\u80fd\u662fLUSC\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9884\u540e\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u548c\u514d\u75ab\u6cbb\u7597\u65b0\u9776\u70b9\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1aFCN3\uff1b\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u514d\u75ab\uff1b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3011.",

    "title": "Health-related quality of life with belzutifan versus everolimus for advanced renal cell carcinoma (LITESPARK-005): patient-reported outcomes from a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.",
    "abstract": "The first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor-2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitor belzutifan is approved for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma previously treated with immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapy based on results of the phase 3 LITESPARK-005 trial. We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from LITESPARK-005. LITESPARK-005 was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled phase 3 trial conducted at 147 hospitals and cancer centres in six regions. Eligible participants were 18 years or older with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma, had a Karnofsky Performance Status score of 70% or higher, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, had disease progression on or after treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (in sequence or in combination), and had received no more than three previous systemic lines of therapy. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using interactive voice-response and web-response systems to receive either belzutifan 120 mg orally once daily or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium prognostic score and number of previous VEGF-targeted or VEGF receptor-targeted therapies. The dual primary outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival, results of which have been reported previously. In this study, prespecified secondary patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from LITESPARK-005 were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Cancer Symptom Index: Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The PRO analysis population included all participants who received at least one dose of study therapy and completed at least one PRO assessment. Least-squares mean change from baseline in PROs at week 17 was assessed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model. Time to deterioration in physical functioning (prespecified) and role functioning (post hoc), as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, were also evaluated in the PRO analysis population. This trial is ongoing, closed to recruitment, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04195750. Between March 10, 2020, and Jan 19, 2022, 996 participants were screened for eligibility and 746 participants were randomly assigned to belzutifan (n=374) or everolimus (n=372). The PRO full analysis set population included 366 participants in the belzutifan group and 354 in the everolimus group. Median time from randomisation to the database cutoff date (June 13, 2023) was 25\u00b77 months (IQR 21\u00b77-30\u00b74). Completion rates for FKSI-DRS and QLQ-C30 were higher than 94% at baseline and higher than 55% at week 17 in each group. Change from baseline to week 17 in FKSI-DRS score (difference in least-squares mean between groups 1\u00b75 [95% CI 0\u00b77 to 2\u00b72]) and QLQ-C30 global health status-quality of life (QOL) score (6\u00b74 [3\u00b72 to 9\u00b76]) suggested stability with belzutifan versus worsening with everolimus. Change from baseline to week 17 was similar between groups for QLQ-C30 physical functioning (difference in least-squares mean 2\u00b75 [95% CI -0\u00b76 to 5\u00b75]) and QLQ-C30 role functioning (4\u00b72 [0\u00b71 to 8\u00b74]) subscale scores. Time to deterioration was similar between the belzutifan and everolimus groups for EORTC physical functioning (median 19\u00b73 months [95% CI 11\u00b71 to not reached] in the belzutifan group vs 13\u00b78 months [10\u00b76 to not reached] in the everolimus group; hazard ratio 0\u00b793 [95% CI 0\u00b772 to 1\u00b720]) and role functioning (median 12\u00b70 months [9\u00b72 to not reached] vs 10\u00b72 months [4\u00b77 to 14\u00b74]; 0\u00b788 [0\u00b769 to 1\u00b711]). Belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma was associated with improved disease-specific symptoms and QOL compared with everolimus. Taken together with the efficacy and safety data from LITESPARK-005, belzutifan could offer a clinical benefit without compromising the QOL of patients in this setting.

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous B cell neoplasm with variable clinical outcomes influenced by both tumor-derived and lymphoma microenvironment (LME) alterations. A recent transcriptomic study identifies four DLBCL subtypes based on LME characteristics: germinal center (GC)-like, mesenchymal (MS), inflammatory (IN), and depleted (DP). However, integrating this classification into clinical practice remains challenging. Here, we utilize deconvolution methods to assess microenvironment component abundance, establishing an LME classification of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry markers and digital pathology based on CD3, CD8, CD68, PD-L1, and collagen. This staining-based algorithm demonstrates over 80% concordance with transcriptome-based classification. Single-cell sequencing confirms that the immune microenvironments distinguished by this algorithm align with transcriptomic profiles. Significant disparities in overall and progression-free survival are observed among LME subtypes following rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP with targeted agents (R-CHOP-X) immunochemotherapy. LME subtypes differed from distinct immune escape mechanisms, highlighting specific immunotherapeutic targets and supporting application of this classification in future precision medicine trials.",

    "title": "Integrated single-cell analysis reveals the regulatory network of disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs in bladder cancer: constructing a prognostic model and predicting treatment response.",
    "abstract": "Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in tumor cell growth, migration, recurrence, and drug resistance, particularly in bladder cancer (BLCA). This study aims to investigate disulfidptosis-related lncRNAs (DRLs) as potential prognostic markers for BLCA patients. Utilizing single-cell sequencing data, RNA sequencing data, and corresponding clinical information sourced from the GEO and TCGA databases, this study conducted cell annotation and intercellular communication analyses to identify differentially expressed disulfide death-related genes (DRGs). Subsequently, Pearson correlation and Cox regression analyses were employed to discern DRLs that correlate with overall survival. A prognostic model was constructed through LASSO regression analysis based on DRLs, complemented by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The performance of this model was rigorously evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Furthermore, this investigation delved into the potential signaling pathways, immune status, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and responses to anticancer therapies associated with varying prognoses in patients with BLCA. We identified twelve differentially expressed DRGs and elucidated their corresponding intercellular communication relationships. Notably, epithelial cells function as ligands, signaling to other cell types, with the interactions between epithelial cells and both monocytes and endothelial cells exhibiting the strongest connectivity. This study identified six DRLs in BLCA-namely, C1RL-AS1, GK-AS1, AC134349.1, AC104785.1, AC011092.3, and AC009951.6, and constructed a nomogram to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. The DRL features demonstrated significant associations with various clinical variables, diverse immune landscapes, and drug sensitivity profiles in BLCA patients. Furthermore, RT-qPCR validation confirmed the aberrant expression levels of these DRLs in BLCA tissues, affirming the potential of DRL characteristics as prognostic biomarkers. We established a DRLs model that serves as a predictive tool for the prognosis of BLCA patients, as well as for assessing tumor mutation burden, immune cell infiltration, and responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Collectively, this study contributes valuable insights toward advancing precision medicine within the context of BLCA.",

    "title": "Biomarkers for predicting bladder cancer therapy response.",
    "abstract": "The advent of precision medicine has underscored the importance of biomarkers in predicting therapy response for bladder cancer, a malignancy marked by considerable heterogeneity. This review critically examines the current landscape of biomarkers to forecast treatment outcomes in bladder cancer patients. We explore a range of biomarkers, including genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, and transcriptomic indicators, from multiple sample sources, including urine, tumor tissue and blood, assessing their efficacy in predicting responses to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. Despite promising developments, the translation of these biomarkers into clinical practice faces significant challenges, such as variability in biomarker performance, the necessity for large-scale validation studies, and the integration of biomarker testing into routine clinical workflows. We also highlight the need for standardized methodologies and robust assays to ensure consistency and reliability. Future directions point towards longitudinal studies and the development of combination biomarker panels to enhance predictive accuracy. This review emphasizes the transformative potential of predictive biomarkers in improving patient outcomes and advocates for continued collaborative efforts to overcome existing barriers in this rapidly evolving field.",

    "title": "Immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancers: current strategies and future directions - a literature review.",
    "abstract": "The National Cancer Institute defines the disease of \"cancer\" as a group of disorders in which aberrant cells proliferate uncontrollably and have the potential to infiltrate neighboring tissues. It is well established that cancer remains a significant etiology contributing to worldwide mortality. Gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms are a type of cancer that affects the digestive system and adds to the total cancer burden. Conventionally, several therapies have been employed, such as radiation and chemotherapy; nevertheless, their adverse effects have prompted the need for an improved therapeutic alternative. Immunotherapy thus became a notable medium of treatment for several malignancies, including tumors of the GI tract. This comprehensive review seeks to provide insight on future directions and prospective therapies under development, as well as information regarding the present strategies utilized to mitigate one of the primary forms of cancer, GI cancer. A detailed analysis of the existing literature on GI cancers has been conducted. Several databases were employed to gather this information, mainly PubMed/MEDLINE. Different aspects of the disease were considered when searching the databases to provide a comprehensive review of the current and future strategies being incorporated to mitigate the negative consequences of this disease. Many strategies are being used currently, and some are still under development. These comprise the usage of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cytokine therapy, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and adoptive cell therapy. For instance, various monoclonal antibodies have been developed to inhibit the immunomodulatory effects of programmed death-1 and programmed death-1 ligand. There are also results of several clinical trials showing significant benefits and many changes are introduced to make the best of these strategies and minimize the challenges to group sizes. These challenges include overcoming the tumor's immunosuppressive environment, finding suitable predictive biomarkers, and reducing the adverse effects. Additionally, several novel immunotherapeutic approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, are being studied. In 2017, the US FDA approved the use of two CAR-T therapies, which marks a major milestone following extensive research and clinical trials. New approaches such as toll-like receptor-directed and helminth-based immunotherapies are being developed for the treatment of GI cancers as well. These therapies, along with targeted treatments, represent the future of immunotherapy in GI cancers. Immunotherapy plays a significant role in the different types of GI cancers. However, optimizing these treatments will require overcoming barriers such as immune resistance, minimizing side effects, and improving the selection of patients through biomarkers. Continued research into these novel therapies and the mechanisms of immune modulation will be key to maximizing the therapeutic benefits of immunotherapy in the future.",

Active compounds and their potential targets were identified through an integrative approach involving GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, as well as UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted, followed by molecular docking to explore compound-target interactions. The anti-proliferative effects of isochlorogenic acid A (ICGA-A) and chicoric acid (CRA) on MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay.  TOE and its active constituents, ICGA-A and CRA, demonstrate potential in augmenting PD-1 blockade therapy for TNBC. This study investigated the combination of ICGA-A and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor 2, which significantly enhanced the infiltration of macrophages and CD8+ T cells into tumors in murine models, while concurrently reducing the population of exhausted T cells. Furthermore, CRA notably increased the frequency of CD8+ T cells. Both ICGA-A and CRA therapies were also found to suppress tumor proliferation by inhibiting the FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of ICGA-A and CRA as effective adjuvants to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor-based immunotherapy in TNBC.

    "title": "Dual role of interferon-gamma in the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is a cytokine produced mainly by immune cells and can affect cancer cells by modulating the activity of multiple signaling pathways, including the canonical Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) cascade. In melanoma, IFN-\u03b3 can exert both anticancer effects associated with cell-cycle arrest and cell death induction and protumorigenic activity related to immune evasion leading to melanoma progression. Notably, IFN-\u03b3 plays a crucial role in the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which are currently used in the clinic. As these agents target programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), they are designed to restore the antimelanoma immune response. In this respect, IFN-\u03b3 produced by cells in the tumor microenvironment in response to ICIs has a beneficial influence on both immune and melanoma cells by increasing antigen presentation, recruiting additional T-cells to the tumor site, and inducing direct antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in melanoma cells. Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 itself and IFN-\u03b3-related gene signatures during the response to ICIs can constitute biomarkers or predictors of the clinical outcome of melanoma patients treated with ICIs. However, owing to its multifaceted roles, IFN-\u03b3 can also contribute to developing mechanisms associated with the acquisition of resistance to ICIs. These mechanisms can be associated with either decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels in the tumor microenvironment or diminished responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3 due to changes in the melanoma phenotypes associated with affected activity of other signaling pathways or genetic alterations e.g., in JAK, which restricts the ability of melanoma cells to respond to IFN-\u03b3. In this respect, the influence of IFN-\u03b3 on melanoma-specific regulators of the dynamic plasticity of the cell phenotype, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)/CD271 can affect the clinical efficacy of ICIs. This review comprehensively discusses the role of IFN-\u03b3 in the response of melanoma patients to ICIs with respect to its positive influence and role in IFN-\u03b3-related mechanisms of resistance to ICIs as well as the potential use of predictive markers on the basis of IFN-\u03b3 levels and signatures of IFN-\u03b3-dependent genes.",

These nano-sized vesicles, released by both tumor and stromal cells, carry a diverse cargo of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, reflecting the dynamic cellular landscape and mediating intricate interactions between cells. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biogenesis, composition, and functional roles of EVs in cancer, highlighting their significance in both basic research and clinical applications. We discuss how cancer cells manipulate EV biogenesis pathways to produce vesicles enriched with pro-tumorigenic molecules, explore the specific contributions of EVs to key hallmarks of cancer, such as angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion, emphasizing their role in shaping TME and driving therapeutic resistance. Concurrently, we submit recent knowledge on how the cargo of EVs can serve as a valuable source of biomarkers for minimally invasive liquid biopsies, and its therapeutic potential, particularly as targeted drug delivery vehicles and immunomodulatory agents, showcasing their promise for enhancing the efficacy and safety of cancer treatments. By deciphering the intricate messages carried by EVs, we can gain a deeper understanding of cancer biology and develop more effective strategies for early detection, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, paving the way for a new era of personalized and precise cancer medicine with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3K\u03b3), the only class IB PI3 kinase, is a cell-extrinsic immunotherapy target in solid tumors. PI3K\u03b3 inhibition reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid cells to acquire immunostimulatory phenotypes, which promote antitumor cytotoxic T cell activity. Although PI3K\u03b3 inhibition has no direct effect on solid tumor cells, several new studies have nominated PI3K\u03b3 as a cell-intrinsic target in various leukemias, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Intrinsic dependency on PI3K\u03b3 is present at baseline in leukemias with specific pathologic characteristics, is inducible by extrinsic inflammation in others, and may also be acquired with resistance to certain therapies. The discovery of leukemia PI3K\u03b3 dependency has generated enthusiasm for immediate clinical trial evaluation of inhibitor monotherapy and combinations. Parallel laboratory evaluation is needed to develop an improved understanding of leukemia disease features associated with clinical inhibitor sensitivity that might suggest biomarker-directed patient enrichment strategies. In this review, we discuss recent progress credentialling PI3K\u03b3 as a bona fide target in leukemia. We also highlight open questions, including a need to understand the mechanism of acquired resistance to PI3K\u03b3 inhibition, how to optimally prioritize combination therapies to enhance PI3K\u03b3 inhibitor utility, and how cell-extrinsic effects of PI3K\u03b3 inhibition in the leukemia microenvironment might also contribute to clinical activity.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic and anticancer activities of microRNA-4477a (miR-4477a) as a PD-L1 inhibitor in breast cancer cells (MCF-7). To this end, a series of analytical procedures were conducted, including bioinformatic analysis, RT-PCR analysis, PD-L1 ELISA, in vitro co-culture analysis, cytotoxicity assays, cell migration assays, and colony formation assays, with the objective of determining the anticancer activity of the compound in question. The results demonstrated that miR-4477a can bind to three distinct regions of PD-L1 mRNA with high scores (94%, 88% and 80%), effectively targeting and suppressing the crucial regulatory pathways of cancer cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that a 25 nM dose of miR-4477a caused relatively high cytotoxicity in the MCF-7 cell line, suppressed PD-L1 gene expression, and decreased sPD-L1 protein levels, strongly inhibited cell migration, and significantly reduced colony formation. The in vitro co-culture analysis revealed that cancer cells were unable to evade the surveillance and cytotoxic activity of T cells (CD8 In conclusion, miRNA-4477a has the capacity to regulate immune responses in breast cancer cells and may therefore be a promising candidate for use in cancer immunotherapy as a therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate local therapy may provide survival benefits in oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapy. However, its roles in immunotherapy-treated patients have not been fully understood. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-treated metastatic NSCLC patients were enrolled in a prospective multi-center observational study (NCT04766515) from September 2020 to March 2023. Those without driver mutations, with measurable disease and harboring oligometastatic disease were included. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between those with or without early local therapy (eLT). Moreover, eLT performed within or after 1\u00a0month of the initiation of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was defined as concurrent- or sequential-LT, respectively. While, eLT targeting partial or all of the tumor lesions, was described as partial- or all-LT, respectively. Among the 180 patients identified, eLT was performed in 44, including concurrent-LT in 25 and all-LT in 19, respectively. With a median follow-up of 19.40\u00a0months, progressive disease occurred in 95 of the 136 patients without eLT. Compared to those without eLT, patients receiving eLT had significantly longer PFS (HR\u2009=\u20090.40, 95% CI 0.27-0.59, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.76, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Moreover, eLT was associated with improved survival after Cox analyses and propensity score matching. Meanwhile, sequential-LT, as well as all-LT, was associated with longer OS, when compared with concurrent-LT or partial-LT, respectively. Early local therapy, especially those performed after effective systemic therapy and targeting all tumor lesions, may prolong patient's survival in PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-treated oligometastatic NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Hepatobiliary cancers are heterogeneous and molecularly complex. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enhanced the understanding of their molecular landscape and enabled deployment of biomarker-based gene- and immune-targeted therapies. This review examines the role of molecular testing and targeted therapies in these malignant neoplasms. Patients with hepatobiliary cancers have poor outcomes. Precision oncology studies have shown that while many common molecular alterations are not currently targetable in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a large number of actionable alterations characterize biliary tract cancers (BTCs), with several therapies now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Immunotherapy is increasingly adopted in clinical practice, either as monotherapy or combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, for both HCC and BTCs. Moreover, multiple solid cancer tumor-agnostic therapies are approved (larotrectinib, entrectinib, and repotrectinib for NTRK fusions; selpercatinib for RET fusions; dabrafenib and trametinib combination for BRAF V600E mutations; dostarlimab or pembrolizumab for tumors with high microsatellite instability and pembrolizumab for tumor mutation burden \u226510 mutations/megabase), highlighting the need for NGS as well as ERBB2 (formerly HER2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) (with the recent approval of solid tissue-agnostic deruxtecan trastuzumab for ERBB2-positive [IHC 3+] cancer) across cancers. N-of-1 clinical trials using customized drug combinations matched to the tumor's molecular profile have yielded encouraging results and provide a promising framework for future clinical trial design. Molecular testing and gene- and immune-targeted therapies are transforming hepatobiliary cancer treatment. Tumor-agnostic and N-of-1 clinical trials have challenged traditional clinical trial paradigms and provide the foundation for truly personalized oncology for patients with these aggressive cancers. Further work is needed to determine how to leverage these novel approaches into the management of operable disease.",

The majority of these patients were male with a median age of 67\u00a0years. Most patients presented at stage IV upon diagnosis with highly aggressive tumors characterized by high Ki-67 proliferation index values resulting in poor overall prognosis. Genetic testing revealed TP53 gene mutations to be most prevalent (21%), followed by KRAS mutations (13%). Patients receiving immunotherapy exhibited significantly longer median overall survival compared to those treated solely with chemotherapy. Targeted drug therapy demonstrated favorable effects in some patients.ConclusionNSCLC patients harboring SMARCA4 deficiency exhibit poor overall survival rates with a median overall survival time of 5.4 months.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with increasing incidence worldwide. Despite surgical resection being the main curative option, only a small percentage of patients are eligible for surgery. Radiotherapy, often combined with chemotherapy, remains a critical treatment, especially for locally advanced cases. However, pancreatic cancer's aggressiveness and partial radio resistance lead to frequent local recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms of radiotherapy resistance is crucial to improving patient outcomes. Pancreatic cancer related gene microarray data were downloaded from GEO database to analyze differentially expressed genes before and after radiotherapy using GEO2R online tool. The obtained differentially expressed genes were enriched by GO and KEGG to reveal their biological functions. Key genes were screened by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and a risk scoring model was constructed, and patients were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the survival differences between the two groups of patients, further analyze the differential genes of the two groups of patients, and evaluate their sensitivity to different drugs. Our model identified 10 genes associated with overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer. Based on risk scores, patients were categorized into high- and low-risk groups, with significantly different survival outcomes and immune profile characteristics. High-risk patients showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory immune markers and increased sensitivity to specific chemotherapy agents, while low-risk patients had higher expression of immune checkpoints (CD274 and CTLA4), indicating potential sensitivity to targeted immunotherapies. Cross-dataset validation yielded consistent AUC values above 0.77, confirming model stability and predictive accuracy. This study provides a scoring model to predict radiotherapy resistance and prognosis in pancreatic cancer, with potential clinical application for patient stratification.

Targeting HER2 with local immunotherapy allows for high tumor specificity in the brain with physiologically very low expression. Monotherapy with CAR-NK cells targeted against HER2 has previously shown efficacy in medium-sized GL261/HER2 tumors. Advanced GL261/HER2 tumors were treated by local CAR-NK cell injection combined with systemic anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Tumor growth and survival were monitored. In-depth characterization of the microenvironment was performed by multiplex immune fluorescence, spectral flow cytometry and RNAseq. Untreated GL261/HER2 tumors were characterized by local immunosuppression and high PD-L1 expression. Combined treatment with NK-92/5.28.z and systemic anti-PD-1 induced robust anti-tumor response and long-term survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence and spectral flow cytometry showed increased CD4 The combination therapy reverted the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with increased T and NKT cell infiltration.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a major health concern with 250,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the USA, 75% of which are hormone receptor positive (HR+), expressing estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and/or the progesterone receptor (PR). Although ER-targeted therapies are available, 30% of patients will develop resistance, underscoring the need for new non-ER/estrogen-based treatments. Notably, HR+BCs exhibit poor lymphocyte infiltration and contain an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which contributes to the limited efficacy of immunotherapies in HR+BC. In this study, we demonstrate that PR/progesterone signaling reduces major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I expression, facilitating immune evasion and escape from immune-based clearance of PR+tumors. To determine the effect of PR/progesterone on MHC Class I expression, we treated human and mouse mammary tumor cell lines with progesterone and/or interferon (IFN) and measured expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (APP), as well as surface MHC Class I expression. We used the OT-I/SIINFEKL model antigen system to measure the impact of progesterone on immune cell-mediated killing of modified tumor cells. We also analyzed two large BC clinical cohorts to determine how PR expression correlates with APP gene expression and MHC Class I expression in ER-positive tumors. In vitro, we show that PR/progesterone signaling reduces APP gene expression and MHC class I expression in human and breast mammary tumor cell lines. PR-mediated attenuation of APP/MHC Class I expression is more pronounced in the presence of IFN. In immune cell killing assays, PR-expressing mammary tumor cells treated with progesterone are protected from immune-mediated cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that PR expression in vivo prevents immune-mediated rejection of xenoantigen-modified mammary tumor cell lines through mechanisms involving MHC Class I expression and CD8 T cells. Data analysis of two large BC cohorts reveals lower APP gene expression and MHC Class I expression in ER/PR-positive tumors compared with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors. These findings show that HR+BCs, specifically PR+tumors, downregulate APP/MHC class I machinery through PR/progesterone signaling. Use of pharmacological PR/progesterone inhibitors may reverse these effects in patients with BC, thereby improving immunosurveillance and response to immunotherapies.",

However, the mechanistic links between these epigenetic modifications during malignant transformation, metastasis, disease relapse, and therapeutic resistance remain incompletely understood. In this research, we investigated the transcriptional and genetic alterations of regulators associated with 3 major types of methylation modifications in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Utilizing ChIP/MeRIP-seq and 450K methylation array data, we identified genes regulated by multiple methylation modifications and constructed a scoring model to quantify the methylation patterns for each patient. Our findings indicate that patients with a low score may be more likely to respond to immunotherapy, whereas patients with a high score may be more sensitive to targeted therapy, such as RITA, Pazopanib, Irlotinib, SU-11274, BRD-K16762525, and FCCP. In conclusion, the score model can serve as a valuable biomarker to guide clinical selection of immunotherapy and targeted drugs and help to improve personalized clear cell renal cell carcinoma treatment.",

    "abstract": "NUP62, a key component of the nuclear pore complex, is closely associated with cellular functions and cancer progression. However, its expression patterns, prognostic value, and relationship with tumour immunity and drug sensitivity across multiple cancers have not been systematically studied. This study used multi-omics analyses combined with experimental validation in gastric cancer to investigate the expression, functional characteristics, and clinical relevance of NUP62 in cancer. Data from TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC databases were used to analyse the expression, mutation characteristics, and clinical associations of NUP62. Tools such as SangerBox, TIMER 2.0, and GSEA were employed to evaluate the relationship between NUP62 and the tumour immune microenvironment, as well as its involvement in signalling pathways. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were used to validate the expression of NUP62 in gastric cancer tissues. PRISM and CTRP databases were utilised to assess the correlation between NUP62 expression and drug sensitivity. NUP62 was significantly upregulated in multiple cancers and was associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as clear cell renal carcinoma (KIRC), lower-grade glioma (LGG), and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), while playing a protective role in others, such as bladder cancer (BLCA) and stomach cancer (STAD). Functional analyses showed that NUP62 is involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, and tumour immunity. High NUP62 expression was significantly correlated with increased infiltration of immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, and a higher response rate to immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis identified NUP62 as a marker of sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents. Validation experiments demonstrated that NUP62 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. NUP62 plays a critical role in multiple cancers and shows potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response prediction. Its role in tumour immunity and signalling pathways highlights its potential as a target for immunotherapy and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the clinical application of targeted therapies and immunotherapy has significantly improved survival outcomes for patients with lung adenocarcinomas(LUAD). However, due to fewer mutations, lung squamous cell carcinomas(LUSC) shows limited efficacy with targeted and immunotherapy, resulting in a notably lower 5-year survival rate compared to lung adenocarcinoma. The m7G modification plays an important role in tumorigenesis, progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic response. This study aims to develop a novel scoring system based on m7G modification and immune status to clinically predict the prognosis of patients with LUSC and to provide new therapeutic targets. In this study, we utilized RNA-seq data from the TCGA-LUSC database as the training set and GSE50081 from the GEO database as the validation set. Immunotherapy data were obtained from the IMMPORT database, and m7G data from previous research. Using bioinformatics, we developed a prognostic model for LUSC based on m7G pathway-related immune gene characteristics. We analyzed the correlation between the prognostic model and clinical pathological features of LUSC, as well as the model's independent prognostic capability. Subsequently, patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, and we examined the differences in enriched pathways, immune cell infiltration correlations, and drug sensitivity between the two groups. The m7G immune-related genes FGA, CSF3R, and ORM1 increase the survival risk in patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, whereas NTS exerts a protective effect. The prognostic risk model for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) based on m7G immune-related gene expression demonstrates that the overall survival of the high-risk group is significantly poorer than that of the low-risk group. The risk model developed based on m7G immune-related genes can help predict the clinical prognosis of LUSC patients and guide treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents a well-established biomarker of PCa, and its levels correlate positively with the disease progression, culminating at the stage of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Due to its tissue-specific expression and cell surface localization, PSMA shows superior potential for precise imaging and therapy of PCa. Antibody-based immunotherapy targeting PSMA offers the promise of selectively engaging the host immune system with minimal off-target effects. Here we report on the design, expression, purification, and characterization of a bispecific engager, termed 5D3-CP33, that efficiently recruits macrophages to the vicinity of PSMA-positive cancer cells mediating PCa death. The engager was engineered by fusing the anti-PSMA 5D3 antibody fragment to a cyclic peptide 33 (CP33), selectively binding the Fc gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI/CD64) on the surface of phagocytes. Functional parts of the 5D3-CP33 engager revealed a nanomolar affinity for PSMA and Fc\u03b3RI/CD64 with dissociation constants of KD =\u2009 3\u2009nM and KD =\u2009 140\u2009nM, respectively. At a concentration as low as 0.3\u2009nM, the engager was found to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species by U937 monocytic cells in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis of PSMA-positive cancer cells by U937 monocytes when exposed to 0.15\u2009nM 5D3-CP33. Our findings illustrate that 5D3-CP33 effectively and specifically activates monocytes upon PSMA-positive target engagement, resulting in the elimination of tumor cells. The 5D3-CP33 engager can thus serve as a promising lead for developing new immunotherapy tools for the efficient treatment of PCa.",

Recent research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut, known as gut microbiota, may play a role in the development and treatment of pancreatic cancer. This review looks at how changes in gut microbiota could influence the onset and progression of pancreatic cancer. We also explore new possibilities for using gut bacteria to help diagnose pancreatic cancer earlier and develop better treatment options.

    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and rapidly proliferative malignancy that has historically had limited therapeutic advancements. Recent advancements in the understanding of SCLC have led to attempts at subtyping the disease based on transcription factor characteristics, offering new insights into its biology and potential therapeutic targets. In addition, significant progress has been made in developing treatment regimens, providing new hope for improved patient outcomes. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab and durvalumab, in combination with traditional chemotherapy, has marked a significant advancement, demonstrating improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Despite these advancements, the prognosis for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC), the more advanced form of SCLC, remains poor, highlighting the critical need for ongoing research and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. New treatment modalities, such as lurbinectedin and anti-Delta-like Canonical Notch Ligand 3 antibodies, are now included in the treatment options for refractory SCLC, and many more treatment strategies involving combination therapies are being studied. Advances in molecular profiling and the identification of biomarkers are aiding in the development of personalized treatment approaches. This review focuses on these recent advancements and emerging strategies in the treatment of ES-SCLC. New hope for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-growing and aggressive type of lung cancer that has had very few effective treatment options for many years. Recently, researchers have made progress in understanding this type of cancer better, including trying to classify it into different subtypes based on specific biological markers. The introduction of new drugs, like immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., atezolizumab and durvalumab), combined with traditional chemotherapy, has shown promising results by helping patients live longer compared to chemotherapy alone. Despite these advances, extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) still has a poor prognosis, which means more research is needed to find better treatments. New therapies, such as lurbinectedin and anti-DLL3 antibodies, have been added to the list of options for patients whose cancer has not responded to previous treatments. Researchers are also studying many new treatment combinations to improve outcomes. Advances in understanding the biology of ES-SCLC and identifying specific markers in patients are aiding in the personalization of treatment strategies to better address individual needs.

    "title": "From cold to hot: mechanisms of hyperthermia in modulating tumor immunology for enhanced immunotherapy.",
    "abstract": "The emergence of immunotherapies has revolutionized cancer treatment by leveraging the immune system to target malignancies, offering new hope where traditional therapies often fall short. Within this context, hyperthermia (HT) has re-emerged as a promising adjunctive treatment, capable of enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. HT influences both the innate and adaptive immune systems, enhancing the activity of immune cells such as neutrophils, NK cells, and dendritic cells, while also modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote immunogenic cell death (ICD) and reduce immunosuppressive conditions. These effects contribute to the transformation of immunologically \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" tumors, making them more susceptible to immune-mediated destruction. Furthermore, HT can amplify the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by improving immune cell infiltration, inducing damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release, and enhancing antigen presentation. Preclinical and clinical studies support the combination of HT with ICIs, demonstrating improved outcomes in otherwise resistant tumors. However, the full therapeutic potential of the different technologies allowing to apply HT remains to be fully understood, and further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols, explore the differential impacts of local versus whole-body hyperthermia, and identify biomarkers for patient stratification. This review underscores the multifaceted role of HT in immunity and its potential to significantly enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Viral mimicry refers to the activation of innate antiviral immune responses due to the induction of endogenous retroelements (REs). Viral mimicry augments antitumor immune responses and sensitizes solid tumors to immunotherapy. Here, we found that targeting what we believe to be a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression, and poor immune cell infiltration. Targeting ZNF638 decreased H3K9 trimethylation, increased REs, and activated intracellular dsRNA signaling cascades. Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in diverse GBM models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate IFN signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1, and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting that dsRNA signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in patients with rGBM and patients with melanoma. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment, but the therapeutic response is highly heterogeneous, which highlights the necessity for developing predictive biomarkers and overcoming ICB resistance. Cancer cell-intrinsic features, especially those that can be dynamically monitored via liquid biopsy, represent a broader scope for biomarker development. In addition, a potential mode of ICB resistance is tumor-intrinsic mechanisms leading to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the underlying interactive network remains elusive, and the generalizable biomarkers and targeting strategies are still lacking. Here, we uncovered the potential of plasma S100 calcium-binding protein A1 (S100A1) for determining ICB efficacy via liquid biopsy of patients with lung cancer. Multiomics and functional studies have suggested that tumor-intrinsic S100A1 expression correlated with an immunologically \"cold\" TME and resistance to ICB in multiple syngeneic murine tumors and tissue samples from patients with lung cancer. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that interfering with the tumor-intrinsic S100A1/ubiquitin-specific protease 7/p65/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) modulatory axis could potentiate an inflamed TME by promoting M1-like macrophage polarization and T cell function. GM-CSF priming was sufficient to enhance the ICB response in tumors with high S100A1 expression in preclinical models. These findings define S100A1 as a potential blood-based biomarker and a novel synergistic target for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for successful treatment and improving patient outcomes. Nanoparticles, such as MXenes, have emerged as a promising tool for various breast cancer applications due to their unique properties. MXenes possess a high surface area and excellent biocompatibility, and can be engineered to enhance targeting ability, as well as mechanical, electrochemical, and optical properties. This review article explores the potential of MXenes in breast cancer detection and treatment, including miRNA detection, MRI-guided photothermal therapy, combined therapy, and immunotherapy. MXenes can be used for miRNA detection, which has shown promise as a biomarker for breast cancer. MXenes can also be used for MRI-guided photothermal therapy, where they can absorb light and convert it into heat to destroy cancer cells. Additionally, MXenes can be used in combination therapy with other drugs to enhance their efficacy. MXenes can also be used for immunotherapy by enhancing the immune response against cancer cells. The article also discusses the future prospects of MXenes in breast cancer research and their cytotoxicity effects. The use of MXenes in breast cancer research is a novel approach with great potential for improving patient outcomes.",

However, resistance mechanisms often limit the effectiveness of ADC monotherapy. This study explores the potential of combining T-DXd with macrophage-targeting therapies, specifically anti-SIRP\u03b1 antibodies and PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors, to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Utilizing HER2-positive preclinical models, we hypothesized that this triple combination would synergistically promote immunogenic cell death (ICD) and reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our results demonstrated that the combination of T-DXd, anti-SIRP\u03b1, and IPI-549 significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to monotherapies, with no major weight loss, indicating a favorable tolerability profile. Sequential treatment further enhanced tumor control, achieving complete regression in some cases. Importantly, previously treated mice developed durable immunological memory, completely rejecting subsequent challenges with HER2-expressing tumors. Overall, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of combining T-DXd with macrophage-targeting strategies as a robust approach to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in HER2-positive cancers, presenting a promising avenue for clinical development.",

However, acquired resistance to these targeted therapies remains a major challenge. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance will be crucial for the development of strategies that might either overcome this effect or delay the onset. Circulating tumour DNA, owing to the need for only minimally invasive sampling and a potential role as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker, is increasingly being used in both research and clinical practice. Several studies have explored the landscape of acquired resistance to targeted therapies using this approach. However, the methodologies of the published studies vary widely, and several major challenges remain in addressing the practical difficulties associated with these methods. These challenges currently limit the depth of research insight provided by the available data. In this Perspective, we review clinical reports describing the use of circulating tumour DNA to detect mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies, predominantly in patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and highlight key unresolved questions with the aim of moving towards more-informative research studies.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing number of diagnostic biomarkers associated with tumor diagnosis, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, access to clinical pathological specimens of an\u00a0appropriate size for analysis is becoming a problem. Conventional high-throughput sequencing assays for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often necessitate the extraction of separate DNA and RNA samples to achieve precise detection of various mutation types. This study aimed to employ RNA-next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to simultaneously detect different types of mutations in NSCLC samples, including single nucleotide variations, insertions and deletions, fusions/rearrangements, and exon skipping, thereby addressing the issue of limited sample availability. Two hundred and twenty cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded NSCLC clinical specimens were retrospectively included for targeted RNA sequencing based on the principle of probe hybridization capture. Lung cancer tissue samples with different storage times were compared for success in DNA-NGS and RNA-NGS assays. The clinical detection performance of RNA-NGS was evaluated by comparing its results to those of DNA-NGS and clinical assays. Samples with inconsistent results were further verified by immunohistochemistry, amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction, or droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. DNA-NGS exhibited an overall success rate of 91.82% in all samples, while RNA-NGS achieved an overall success rate of 92.73%. However, the success rate declined with longer storage times. Compared with DNA-NGS, targeted RNA sequencing for single nucleotide variation/insertion and deletion detection achieved a sensitivity of 93.75%, a specificity of 100%, and an overall concordance of 97.86%. Compared with the validated results, it achieved a sensitivity of 97.96%, a specificity of 99.28%, an and overall concordance of 98.93% in fusion/rearrangement and Met exon skipping detection, which was superior to DNA-NGS. Compared to clinical testing, this assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.33%, a specificity of 100%, and an overall concordance rate of 97.93%. This study substantiates that the targeted RNA-sequencing assay, based on probe hybridization capture, represents a superior detection technology platform for the application of drug targeting. It expeditiously and reliably provides all the requisite biomarkers for current NSCLC targeted therapies in a single-sample testing workflow, facilitating rapid clinical diagnosis and the formulation of rational treatment plans by clinicians.",

With tumor transcriptomics from 134 axi-cel patients, we employed multivariate penalized Cox models analyzing event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). We identified two novel GES, a six-gene/transcript signature (6-GES; CD19, CD45RA, CCL22, KLRK1, SOX11, SIGLEC5) correlated with improved outcome after axi-cel (HR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.16-0.44 for EFS), representing lymphomas with abundant target antigen (CD19) expression, adhesion molecules, and relatively low immune infiltration mostly composed of cytotoxic lymphocytes (T and NK cells) and DCs, and secondly, a 17-gene/transcript signature (17-GES; CD45RO, BCL2, IL-18R1, TNFSF4 [OX40L], KLRB1 [CD161], KIR3DL2, ITGB8, DUSP5, GPC4, PSMB5, RPS6KB1, SERPINA9, NBN,GLUD1, ESR1, ARID1A, and SLC16A1) correlated with disease progression after axi-cel (HR: 6.12, 95% CI: 3.57-10.50 for EFS), consistent with high immune inflammation and escape mechanisms, such as the upregulation of genes involved in repair of damaged DNA or chromatin remodeling, inhibition of apoptosis, and a metabolically restrictive environment. These signatures did not correlate with outcome in the standard-of-care arm of ZUMA-7 (chemotherapy, followed by transplant) or frontline therapy, supporting their predictive rather than prognostic value. The findings were technically reproduced in a subset of ZUMA-7 samples profiled by RNA-seq (axi-cel, n=124; SOC, n=125). The 6-GES was reduced, whereas the 17-GES was elevated at progression post axi-cel, consistent with the notion that these signatures represent features relevant for response and resistance to CAR T-cell therapy. Our transcriptomic analysis identified gene expression signatures potentially predictive of outcome with CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy, and these findings are informative for risk stratification and development of next-generation products.",

This study aimed to compare the real-world efficacy and safety of disitamab vedotin (RC48), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), combined immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), against the gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) regimen with PD-1 immunotherapy in the treatment of MIBC. This single-center, retrospective study was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and included 38 patients with MIBC treated with either RC48 plus immunotherapy or GC regimen plus immunotherapy, between January 2022 and December 2023. Patients were divided into two groups: the RC48 with immunotherapy (ADC + PD-1) group and the GC regimen with immunotherapy (GC + PD-1) group. Efficacy was evaluated based on their pathological complete response rates (PCRR) and pathological downstaging rates (PDR). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed to compare safety profiles. Of the 38 patients, 17 were in the ADC + PD-1 group and 21 were in the GC + PD-1 group. The PCRR was significantly higher in the ADC + PD-1 group (82.35%, 14/17) compared to the GC + PD-1 group (47.62%, 10/21;  RC48 combined with immunotherapy demonstrated a significantly higher PCRR compared to the GC regimen with immunotherapy, while maintaining a comparable safety profile. These findings highlight the potential of RC48 combined with immunotherapy as an effective treatment option for MIBC in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T lymphocytes greatly affect the efficacy of immunotherapy, displaying promising potential in various tumors. Here, we aimed to identify immune subtypes associated with CD8+ T cell-related genes to predict the efficacy of treatment in esophageal cancer (ESCA). We obtained 13 immune cell-related datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and removed batch effects. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and co-expression analysis were performed to identify highly correlated CD8+ T cell genes. Cox analysis was used to process ESCA clinical information, and the immune clusters (ICs) were constructed through consensus cluster analysis. Furthermore, we constructed an immune risk score model to predict the prognosis of ESCA based on these CD8+ T cell genes. This model was verified using the IMvigor210 dataset, and we functionally validated the immune risk score model  The results revealed significant correlations between CD8+ T cell-related genes and immune-related pathways. Three ICs were identified in ESCA, with IC3 demonstrating the most favorable prognosis. The final 6-gene prognostic risk model exhibited stable predictive performance in datasets across different platforms. Compared with that in normal esophageal epithelial (HEEC cells), CHMP7 in the 6-gene prognostic risk model was upregulated in KYSE150 and TE-1 cells. Si-CHMP7 transfection led to a decrease in tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, accompanied by an accelerated apoptotic process. Collectively, we identified the immune subtypes of CD8+ T cell-related genes with different prognostic significance. We designated CHMP7 in the 6-gene prognostic risk model as a potential target to improve tumor cell prognosis. These insights provide a strong basis for improving prognosis and facilitating more personalized and accurate treatment decisions for the immunotherapy of ESCA.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (M\u03c6) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective M\u03c6 depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by M\u03c6 in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of M\u03c6 was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by M\u03c6. M\u03c6 depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving M\u03c6 reprogramming rather than their depletion.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of bispecific antibodies in eliciting potent antitumor responses by redirecting T cells to target cancer cells, particularly for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, their efficacy against solid tumors is limited by intratumoral T-cell dysfunction and inadequate persistence. The co-stimulatory domains of 4-1BB, OX40, and CD28 are most widely used in engineering chimeric antigen receptor T-cells to augment T-cell responses. In this study, we designed three co-stimulatory trispecific T cell-engaging antibodies (TriTCEs) that target Prostate-specific membrane antigen, CD3, and an additional co-stimulatory receptor(OX40, 4-1BB, or CD28). We conducted comparative profiling of the attributes of distinct co-stimulatory signals to T-cell functions in prostate cancer models. Co-stimulatory trispecific T-cell engagers enhance T-cell activation, proliferation, and display tumor cell-killing activity in vitro. These trispecific antibodies further boosted antitumor activity in humanized mouse xenograft models and increased the infiltration of CD45 Collectively, incorporating co-stimulatory receptor targeting domains represents a potentially effective strategy to unlock the full therapeutic potential of T-cell-engaging antibodies for the treatment of solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) constitutes the primary subtype of renal cell carcinoma, representing 75% to 80% of cases and carrying a substantial cancer-specific mortality rate of up to 24%. Despite advancements in treatment options, KIRC displays notable resistance to conventional therapies, emphasizing the need for innovative targeted immunotherapeutic strategies. Chromatin regulators (CRs), pivotal proteins controlling gene expression and critical biological processes, play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of KIRC. This study employed a multi-omics approach to evaluate the impact of CR-associated genes on KIRC prognosis. The study utilized the TCGA-KIRC dataset and employed LASSO Cox regression to construct and validate a prognostic model that focuses on genes influencing KIRC prognosis. The research investigated interactions among gene characteristics, clinical parameters, the tumor microenvironment, targeted immunotherapy, and drug responsiveness. Experimental validation, encompassing various techniques such as cell culture, transient transfection, qPCR, Transwell assays, confirmed the robust predictive capability of the BRD9 gene. The analysis identified the risk score of CRs as an independent factor determining KIRC prognosis. Furthermore, the study introduced a predictive Nomogram model that integrates clinical attributes and risk assessment. Significantly, BRD9 exhibited substantially elevated expression within KIRC cells, underscoring its role in driving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. These findings suggest the potential for tailored immunotherapy targeting BRD9 in the treatment of KIRC. This study presents an innovative prognostic framework for KIRC based on multi-omics approaches, seamlessly incorporating CRs. This model holds promise for improving the accuracy of prognosis prediction for KIRC patients, laying a robust foundation for the development of targeted immunotherapies.",

Our results highlight that CD19 is important for survival and CXCL12-induced migration, and mAbs variably increase CXCL12-induced migration and enhance ADCC. Additionally, we demonstrate that the endogenous peptide inhibitor of the CXCR4 (EPI-X4) derivative JM#21 effectively inhibits CD19-mediated migration enhancement and promotes ADCC, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of CD19 mAb-based immunotherapy in lymphoma models.

    "title": "Identification of TAP2 as a novel immune target in human cancers: insights from integrated bioinformatics and experimental approaches.",
    "abstract": "Transporter 2, ATP binding cassette (ABC) subfamily B member (TAP2), encodes a protein within the ABC transporter superfamily. TAP2 plays a role in the progression of cancers, such as cervical, breast, and lung cancers. However, the relationship between TAP2 and cancer prognosis, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and immunotherapy remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of TAP2 expression on its role in predicting tumor prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. Bioinformatics analyses such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, single-cell, and Connectivity Map analyses were used to comprehensively assess TAP2-related genomic alterations, prognostic value, enrichment pathways, single-cell expression patterns, and potential targeting inhibitors. In addition, molecular docking techniques were used to simulate drug binding to TAP2. WB and RT-qPCR were used to detect differences in TAP2 expression in glioma cell lines. The U251MG cell line was established with TAP2 overexpression. The effects of elevated TAP2 expression on GBM cell function was evaluated using various assays, including the Transwell migration, scratch, and clonal formation assays. TAP2 exhibited aberrantly expression in tumor tissues with genomic alterations. TAP2 significantly correlates with poor prognosis across various cancers. It was also involved in immune-related pathways, immune infiltration, and immune checkpoint regulation, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response to cancer. TAP2 was identified as a potential predictor of immunotherapy response and screened for potential targeted inhibitors for future therapeutic interventions. Our findings suggest that TAP2 may serve as a promising prognostic marker and immune target in human cancers, warranting further investigation into its role in tumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Oxysterol binding protein-related protein 10 (OSBPL10) is a crucial sterol transporter that plays a significant role in regulating metabolic homeostasis. Previous studies have indicated that OSBPL10 promotes the development of several tumors. However, an integrative bioinformatics and immune infiltration analysis of OSBPL10 across various cancers has yet to be conducted. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the expression patterns, prognostic value, genetic variations, protein modifications, immune infiltration characteristics, and biological functions of OSBPL10 in 33 human cancers using bioinformatics methods and publicly available databases, including TCGA, GEPIA2, GTEx, UCSC, UALCAN, HPA and TISCH2.0. The function of OSBPL10 and its associated mechanisms were confirmed in the pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and Mia PaCa-2. Our results revealed that OSBPL10 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in 12 types of tumor tissues and downregulated in 3 cancers, which was notably associated with poor prognosis, pathological stage, and subtype in 10 tumors. Additionally, the level of promoter methylation exhibited a significant negative correlation with OSBPL10 mRNA expression. OSBPL10 expression was found to be dramatically associated with the levels of chemokines, chemokine receptors, immune checkpoints, and immune cell infiltration across various tumors by activating cancer pathways related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and TSC/mTOR while downregulating tumor cell stemness. Furthermore, elevated OSBPL10 expression was negatively correlated with most drug sensitivities. In vitro experiments showed that OSBPL10 promoted the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells through the VEGF/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, our pan-cancer analysis suggests that OSBPL10 may serve as a critical biomarker for improving prognosis through OSBPL10-targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and chemotherapeutic combinations in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of biliary tract cancer (BTC) is on the rise, presenting a substantial healthcare challenge. The integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with molecularly targeted therapies is emerging as a strategy to enhance immune responses. However, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of these treatments in BTC are still largely unexplored. In this study, tissue samples from 19 BTC patients treated with camrelizumab and apatinib were analysed using the NanoString 289-panel to identify key molecular biomarkers. Comparative analyses and subsequent experimental validations, including cell-based assays and histopathological examinations, identified adrenomedullin (ADM) as a critical molecular marker associated with treatment efficacy and poor prognosis. ADM has been shown to promote BTC cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, primarily by interacting with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and increasing AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, ADM disrupts endothelial cell barrier function via the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin signalling pathway. Preclinical inhibition of ADM or CRLR resulted in suppressed tumour growth. Additionally, elevated ADM expression was correlated with increased tumour-infiltrating immune cells and higher immune checkpoint expression. These findings suggest that ADM plays a pivotal role in resistance to immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic treatment in BTC, and thus, targeting ADM may offer a promising therapeutic approach to enhance treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) IgG1-based antibody therapies significantly improve cancer prognosis, yet intrinsic or acquired resistance to fragment antigen-binding (Fab)-mediated direct effects commonly occurs. Most resistant tumors retain antigen expression and therefore remain potentially targetable with anti-HER2 therapies that promote immune-mediated responses. Tumor-antigen-specific IgE class antibodies can mediate powerful immune cell-mediated effects against different cancers and have been shown to activate IgE Fc receptor-expressing monocytes. We previously reported the engineering of a trastuzumab-equivalent anti-HER2 IgE antibody and showed early evidence of Fc-mediated cancer cell-targeting effects. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-tumoral functions of two anti-HER2 IgEs, trastuzumab and pertuzumab IgE. In vitro functionality of the two anti-HER2 antibodies was assessed by HER2 phosphorylation and ligand-independent viability assays, as well as basophil (RBL-SX38) degranulation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity/antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis(ADCC/ADCP) assays and primary monocyte stimulation assays. The potential to trigger a hypersensitivity type I reaction was investigated using the basophil activation test (BAT). anti-tumoral efficacy was assessed in two humanized HER2+, trastuzumab-resistant models in vivo. Changes in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by flow cytometry or bulk RNA sequencing. We demonstrate the anti-tumoral and immunostimulatory functions of two anti-HER2 IgEs derived from variable region sequences of the clinically available trastuzumab and pertuzumab IgG1 antibodies. IgE engagement of monocytes via the Fc region induced tumor cell cytotoxicity and a pro-inflammatory shift with upregulation of immune-stimulatory CD40, CD80 and CD86, and downregulation of scavenger CD163, cell surface molecules. This was accompanied by enhanced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 cytokine production. The absence of basophil activation by anti-HER2 IgEs ex vivo in whole blood points to potentially safe administration in humans. In two trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ tumor xenograft models in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human immune cells, the trastuzumab-equivalent anti-HER2 IgE restricted tumor growth. Treatment was associated with enriched classical (CD14 Collectively, anti-HER2 IgE maintains Fab-mediated antitumor activity, induces Fc-mediated effects against HER2-expressing tumor cells, and stimulates remodeling of the immune microenvironment in tumors to promote pro-inflammatory cell phenotypes which could translate to improved outcomes for patients.",

In autoimmunity, aberrant CS1 signaling contributes to the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, driving pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Conversely, in oncology, CS1 serves as a promising immunotherapeutic target, exemplified by the efficacy of the monoclonal antibody Elotuzumab in multiple myeloma. CS1 mediates immune cell functions through intricate signaling pathways, including interactions with EAT-2 and SAP adaptors, which influence cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and immune homeostasis. Beyond cancer and autoimmune diseases, soluble and membrane-bound forms of CS1 are emerging as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Despite significant progress, gaps remain in understanding CS1\\u2019s mechanisms, variability in expression, and role in other diseases.

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide, often diagnosed at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and irinotecan, either as monotherapies or in combination with ramucirumab, are currently standard second-line treatments for GC. However, the efficacy of these therapies is limited, necessitating the development of new combination strategies to improve response rates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown success in first-line treatment for advanced GC, leading to interest in immune rechallenge strategies for second-line treatment. Re-challenging patients with ICIs after progression on first-line treatment may restore immune responses and provide additional clinical benefit. Recently, cadonilimab (AK104), a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, has demonstrated promising antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy in advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. However, the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with AK104 for the treatment of advanced GC remain unclear. Furthermore, identifying predictive biomarkers of efficacy is essential to developing personalized treatment strategies. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel combined with AK104 as a second-line treatment for patients who have progressed after first-line chemoimmunotherapy, focusing on evaluating the therapeutic effect of ICIs rechallenge in gastric cancer. This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical study. Eligible patients were histologically or cytologically diagnosed with unresectable recurrent or metastatic GC, failed first-line chemotherapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor, aged between 18-75 years old, expected survival \u22653 months, and with a physical status of 0 or 1 in the Eastern Cooperative Cancer Group (ECOG). Enrolled patients will receive intravenous cadonilimab (AK104) 6 mg/kg on days 1, and 15, and intravenous nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m This study is the first prospective trial to evaluate the combination of nab-paclitaxel and cadonilimab as second-line treatment after first-line chemoimmunotherapy failure. By investigating immune rechallenge, it aims to reactivate anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes in GC patients. The exploration of predictive biomarkers, such as ctDNA, TMB, MSI, PD-L1 expression, TIL profiles, and gut microbiota, will help personalize treatment and identify patients most likely to benefit from immune rechallenge. This trial could provide valuable insights into overcoming immune resistance and contribute to developing a promising second-line therapeutic strategy for advanced GC.

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a critical immune checkpoint receptor and a target for cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We investigated PD-1 transcript expression across cancer types and its correlations to clinical outcomes. Using a reference population, PD-1 expression was calculated as percentiles in 489 of 514 patients (31 cancer types) with advanced/metastatic disease. PD-1 RNA expression varied across and within cancer types; pancreatic and liver/bile duct malignancies displayed the highest rates of high PD-1 (21.82% and 21.05%, respectively). Elevated CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIGIT RNA expression were independently correlated with high PD-1. Although high PD-1 was not associated with outcome in immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients (n\u2009=\u2009272), in patients who received ICIs (n\u2009=\u2009217), high PD-1 transcript expression was independently correlated with prolonged survival (hazard ratio 0.40; 95%CI, 0.18-0.92). This study identifies PD-1 as an important biomarker in predicting ICI outcomes, and advocates for comprehensive immunogenomic profiling in cancer management.",

    "abstract": "Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) is a rare gynecological tumor with limited treatment options for advanced stages. Current chemotherapy, adapted from cervical cancer protocols, often results in poor outcomes. This scoping review evaluates the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy and targeted therapies in advanced VSCC. After extensive assessment, examination, and curation of relevant literature data, eight trials focused on immunotherapy or targeted therapy for advanced, recurrent, or metastatic VSCCs were identified and selected. The findings have been compiled and synthesized into a narrative overview, adhering to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The study analyzed four unpublished and four published trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy or targeted therapy for VSCCs. Pembrolizumab was assessed in the KEYNOTE-028 and KEYNOTE-158 trials, showing objective response rates (ORRs) of 6\u202f% and 10.9\u202f%, respectively, and median overall survival (OS) between 3.8 and 6.2 months. CheckMate 358 reported a 20\u202f% ORR for nivolumab. Combination strategies (ipilimumab plus nivolumab and pembrolizumab plus vorinostat) demonstrated efficacy with median OS of 7.6 and 17.5 months, respectively. Toripalimab showed an ORR of 33.3\u202f%. Safety profiles were generally manageable, with common adverse events like fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders. Serious adverse events included grade 5 immune-related hepatitis and chronic kidney disease. Immunotherapy may be considered an option for VSCCs in the second-line setting. Despite the limited research on targeted therapies for VSCCs, combination approaches with immunotherapy demonstrate promising potential. Prioritizing the identification of biomarkers that predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors is essential.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and eradicate tumor cells. Among these, inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable clinical efficacy across various malignancies. This review delves into the mechanisms of action, clinical applications, and emerging therapeutic strategies surrounding PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. We explore the intricate interactions between PD-1/PD-L1 and other immune checkpoints, shedding light on combinatorial approaches to enhance treatment outcomes and overcome resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss the expanding landscape of immune checkpoint inhibitors beyond PD-1/PD-L1, including novel targets such as CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT. Through a comprehensive analysis of preclinical and clinical studies, we highlight the promise and challenges of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy, paving the way for future advancements in the field.",

    "abstract": "Biological targeting is crucial for effective cancer treatment with reduced toxicity but is limited by the availability of tumor surface markers. To overcome this, we developed a nanoparticle-based (NP-based), tumor-specific surface marker-independent (TRACER) targeting approach. Utilizing the unique biodistribution properties of NPs, we encapsulated Ac4ManNAz (Maz) to selectively label tumors with azide-reactive groups. Surprisingly, while NP-delivered Maz was cleared by the liver, it did not label macrophages, potentially reducing off-target effects. To exploit this tumor-specific labeling, we functionalized anti-4-1BB Abs with dibenzocyclooctyne to target azide-labeled tumor cells and activate the immune response. In syngeneic B16F10 melanoma and orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer models, TRACER enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-4-1BB, increasing the median survival time. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed increased tumor infiltration of CD8+ T and NK cells with TRACER. Importantly, TRACER reduced the hepatotoxicity associated with anti-4-1BB, resulting in normal serum ALT and AST levels and decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration into the liver. Quantitative analysis confirmed a 4.5-fold higher tumor-to-liver ratio of anti-4-1BB accumulation with TRACER compared with conventional anti-4-1BB Abs. Our work provides a promising approach for developing targeted cancer therapies that circumvent limitations imposed by the paucity of tumor-specific markers, potentially improving efficacy and reducing off-target effects to overcome the liver toxicity associated with anti-4-1BB.",

Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. However, GREM1's specific role in LUAD remains unclear. This study systematically examines GREM1 expression in LUAD and its association with tumor progression, immune microenvironment, and prognosis. Gene expression data from the TCGA and GSE31210 databases were analyzed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The prognostic value of GREM1 was evaluated through survival analysis, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, immune microenvironment analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between GREM1 and immune cell infiltration.  GREM1 was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, GREM1 was significantly associated with immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy response within the immune microenvironment.  A comprehensive analysis indicates that GREM1 is crucial in LUAD progression, with its overexpression predicting poor prognosis. GREM1 could be a potential therapeutic target for LUAD, providing insights for personalized therapy optimization.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has gained momentum with the discovery of novel antibodies targeting immunosuppressive proteins. HLA-E, a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) protein, exhibits immunosuppressive properties, potentially influencing tumor immune evasion mechanisms. The association between Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) expression and outcomes in solid tumors remains unclear. A systematic review of MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to March 15, 2024, was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating HLA-E expression in solid tumors and its association with OS and DFS were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 3.0) with random-effects models. After screening 657 articles, 11 studies were included, comprising a total of 1781 patients. The studies encompassed a variety of cancer types, follow-up periods, and staging details, with the majority focusing on non-metastatic cases. Notably, three studies evaluated colorectal cancer, while others focused on pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal cell, gastric, endometrial, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. The mean age of the patients was 59.81 \u00b1 2.01 years, and the median follow-up period was 57.45 \u00b1 8.91 months. HLA-E expression demonstrated no statistically significant association with OS (HR 0.913, 95% CI = 0.567-1.469; P=0.707), with significant heterogeneity observed (I2\u00a0=\u00a084%). However, HLA-E non-expression was significantly associated with improved DFS (HR 1.406, 95% CI = 1.027-1.930; P=0.03), with moderate heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u00a045%). This systematic review highlights that HLA-E expression in solid tumors could be a biomarker of better prognosis, measured by DFS. These findings align with the clinical benefit observed for agents targeting this pathway. However, further studies should be performed to confirm these preliminary observations. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024527598, identifier CRD42024527598.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a pioneering cancer treatment, achieving unprecedented success in treating certain hematological malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias. However, as more cancer patients receive CAR-T cell therapies, treatment-associated secondary primary malignancies are increasingly being reported partly due to unexpected CAR transgene insertion, raising serious safety concerns. To address this issue, we describe here a nonviral, non-integrating approach to generate transient CAR-T cells using mRNA. We electroporated T cells with modified mRNA encoding a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific CAR and generated transient HER2-targeted CAR-T cells. The CAR was efficiently expressed on the T cell surface 1 day after electroporation, increased by day 2, and dramatically declined by day 5. The transient CAR-T cells exhibited potent cytotoxicity against HER2-positive SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells and secreted high levels of IFN-\u03d2. This protocol provides a step-by-step guide for developing small-scale transient CAR-T cells without permanent CAR transgene integration, describing detailed procedures for preparation of CAR mRNA, activation and transfection of T cells, assessment of CAR expression, and in vitro analysis of CAR-T cell function. This method is suitable for transient CAR-T cell generation in both preclinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant global health challenge, ranking as the fourth most common cancer among women. Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiological factor, leading to immune evasion mechanisms that promote tumor development and progression. Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in the management of cervical cancer, aiming to restore and enhance the body's immune response against tumor cells. Checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have shown promising results in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, has been approved for PD-L1-positive cervical cancer, demonstrating durable responses. However, low response rates necessitate exploration of combination strategies. Trials are underway combining checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, radiation, or other immunotherapeutic agents to enhance efficacy. Therapeutic vaccines targeting HPV antigens, such as E6 and E7 oncoproteins, are also a focus of active research. These vaccines aim to elicit robust cytotoxic T-cell responses, offering a potential strategy for early intervention and disease control. Adoptive T-cell therapies, including engineered T-cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, represent cutting-edge advancements, though challenges with tumor heterogeneity and off-target effects persist. However, challenges such as limited response rates and immune evasion mechanisms remain. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in cervical cancer, characterized by immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, poses a significant barrier to effective immunotherapy. Emerging approaches targeting the TME, such as cytokine modulation, hold promise in overcoming resistance mechanisms. Key gaps include a lack of biomarkers for patient selection, insufficient understanding of TME dynamics, and suboptimal strategies for overcoming antigen heterogeneity and immune resistance. This review addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of cervical cancer immunotherapy, identifying critical barriers, and highlighting emerging approaches, such as combination therapies, novel immune targets, and strategies to modulate the TME, to guide future research and clinical practice.",

    "title": "The epigenetic basis of hepatocellular carcinoma - mechanisms and potential directions for biomarkers and therapeutics.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth leading cancer worldwide and has complex pathogenesis due to its heterogeneity, along with poor prognoses. Diagnosis is often late as current screening methods have limited sensitivity for early HCC. Moreover, current treatment regimens for intermediate-to-advanced HCC have high resistance rates, no robust predictive biomarkers, and limited survival benefits. A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of HCC may enhance tumor characterization and targeting of key carcinogenic signatures. The epigenetic landscape of HCC includes complex hallmarks of 1) global DNA hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressors; 2) histone modifications, altering chromatin accessibility to upregulate oncogene expression, and/or suppress tumor suppressor gene expression; 3) genome-wide rearrangement of chromatin loops facilitating distal enhancer-promoter oncogenic interactions; and 4) RNA regulation via translational repression by microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA modifications. Additionally, it is useful to consider etiology-specific epigenetic aberrancies, especially in viral hepatitis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which are the main risk factors of HCC. This article comprehensively explores the epigenetic signatures in HCC, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Additionally, we examine how etiology-specific epigenetic patterns and the integration of epigenetic therapies with immunotherapy could advance personalized HCC treatment strategies.",

These malignancies are distinguished by a high likelihood of metastasis and multisite recurrence, making them biologically different from other endometrial cancer sub-types. This review aims to analyze the existing evidence regarding molecular classification, new biomarkers, and innovative treatment approaches for these high-risk tumors. Herein, we explored the role of biomarkers, including HER2, TP53, and mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability hypermutated and their influence on treatment strategies, surveillance approaches, the potential role of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid, novel precision-based treatment options, and disparate survival outcomes for non-Hispanic Black and other underserved minority patients, along with strategies to improve outcomes for these patients. Substantial progress has been made in the last 5 years, prompting the following question: What lies ahead in the next 5 years? Our current understanding of uterine serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma underscores the necessity of continuing to prioritize biomarker-driven therapies and the development of novel treatments through clinical trials while integrating these new strategies with traditional approaches, such as surgical resection and cytotoxic chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes under anti-PD-(L)1 therapy have been variable in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without reliable predictive biomarkers so far. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has demonstrated potential clinical utility to support clinical decisions, but requires prior tumor genetic profiling for proper interpretation, and wide adoption remains limited due to high costs. Tumor-agnostic low-coverage ctDNA whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) was used to longitudinally track genome-wide copy number variations (CNVs) and fragmentation features in advanced NSCLC patients (n\u2009=\u2009118 samples from 49 patients) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200957). Tumor PD-L1 expression was available for comparison. Fragmentation features and CNVs were complementary indicators, whose combination significantly increased ctDNA detection compared to single-marker assessments (+\u200920.3% compared to CNV analysis alone). Baseline fragment length alterations, but not CNVs, were significantly associated with subsequent progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20094.10, p\u2009=\u20096.58e-05) and could improve PFS predictions based on tumor PD-L1 expression alone (HR\u2009=\u20092.70, p\u2009=\u20090.019). Residual CNVs or aberrant fragmentation of ctDNA under ongoing therapy could stratify patients according to the subsequent response duration (median 5.8 vs. 47.0 months, p\u2009=\u20091.13e-06). The integrative analysis of ctDNA fragment characteristics at baseline, tumor PD-L1 expression, and residual ctDNA under ongoing treatment constituted the strongest independent predictor of PFS (p\u2009=\u20096.25e-05) and overall survival (p\u2009=\u20091.3e-03) in multivariable analyses along with other clinicopathologic variables.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy of cancer is now an essential pillar of treatment for patients with many individual tumor types. Novel immune targets and technical advances are driving a rapid exploration of new treatment strategies incorporating immune agents in cancer clinical practice. Immunotherapies perturb a complex system of interactions among genomically unstable tumor cells, diverse cells within the tumor microenvironment including the systemic adaptive and innate immune cells. The drive to develop increasingly effective immunotherapy regimens is tempered by the risk of immune-related adverse events. Evidence-based biomarkers that measure the potential for therapeutic response and/or toxicity are critical to guide optimal patient care and contextualize the results of immunotherapy clinical trials. Responding to the lack of guidance on biomarker testing in early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials, we propose a definition and listing of essential biomarkers recommended for inclusion in all such protocols. These recommendations are based on consensus provided by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) faculty with input from the SITC Pathology and Biomarker Committees and the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer readership. A consensus-based selection of essential biomarkers was conducted using a Delphi survey of SCION faculty. Regular updates to these recommendations are planned. The inaugural list of essential biomarkers includes complete blood count with differential to generate a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or systemic immune-inflammation index, serum lactate dehydrogenase and albumin, programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite stability assessment, and tumor mutational burden. Inclusion of these biomarkers across early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials will capture variation among trials, provide deeper insight into the novel and established therapies, and support improved patient selection and stratification for later-phase clinical trials.",

However, the limited availability of robust, scalable methods for generating clinical-grade NK cells remains a limiting factor to broader clinical application. Here we report the development of a novel feeder-cell-free culture system optimized for producing NK cells from cord blood-derived CD34 Flow and mass cytometric analysis confirmed the expression of activating receptors, transcription factors (ID2, T-bet) and cytotoxic molecules (perforin, granzyme A/B), all essential for ProT-NK cell functionality. These cells are in an immature state, indicated by the absence of maturation markers (CD16, KIRs). Functional assays demonstrated that these ProT-NK cells are capable of degranulation and cytokines production (TNF\u03b1) upon stimulation with K562 target cells and showed cytotoxicity against K562 cells superior to that of Peripheral Blood (PB)-NK. In NSG-Tg(hIL-15) mice, ProT-NK cells colonize bone marrow, the liver, and the spleen and persist and mature in bone marrow for at least 9 days post-injection. Compared to ProT-NK D21, ProT-NK D14 was superior in functional and homing potential.  Our ex vivo culture process supports scalable ProT-NK cell production in high yields, reducing dependency on feeder cells and mitigating contamination risks. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of generating large, functional NK cell populations from HSPCs isolated from readily available cord blood sources and offer an efficient alternative to PB-NK cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in driving drug resistance in gastrointestinal cancers (GI), particularly through the pathways of fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis. Cancer cells often rewire their metabolism to sustain growth and reshape the TME, creating conditions such as nutrient depletion, hypoxia, and acidity that impair antitumor immune responses. Immune cells within the TME also undergo metabolic alterations, frequently adopting immunosuppressive phenotypes that promote tumor progression and reduce the efficacy of therapies. The competition for essential nutrients, particularly glucose, between cancer and immune cells compromises the antitumor functions of effector immune cells, such as T cells. Additionally, metabolic by-products like lactate and kynurenine further suppress immune activity and promote immunosuppressive populations, including regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages. Targeting metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis presents new opportunities to overcome drug resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GI cancers. Modulating these key pathways has the potential to reinvigorate exhausted immune cells, shift immunosuppressive cells toward antitumor phenotypes, and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies and other treatments. Future strategies will require continued research into TME metabolism, the development of novel metabolic inhibitors, and clinical trials evaluating combination therapies. Identifying and validating metabolic biomarkers will also be crucial for patient stratification and treatment monitoring. Insights into metabolic reprogramming in GI cancers may have broader implications across multiple cancer types, offering new avenues for improving cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is driven by a complex network of resistance mechanisms against standard-of-care therapies, resulting in poor long-term outcomes. This review offers a uniquely comprehensive and integrative perspective on these resistance pathways, systematically examining both androgen receptor (AR)-dependent factors (including AR overexpression, point mutations, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, splice variants, post-translational modifications, altered coregulators, and intratumoral hormone biosynthesis) and AR-independent pathways (such as neuroendocrine differentiation, lineage plasticity, and alternative growth factor signaling). We also highlight resistance mechanisms influencing immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiopharmaceutical therapy and targeted therapy. By synthesizing emerging insights across these domains, this review not only clarifies the underlying biology of mCRPC resistance but also identifies key leverage points for more effective interventions. Building on this foundation, we propose a forward-looking framework for overcoming mCRPC drug resistance, emphasizing the importance of biomarker-guided patient selection, combination strategies that simultaneously target multiple resistance mechanisms, and novel therapies under investigation. These recommendations are intended to guide future clinical trial designs and research priorities that move beyond incremental improvements. Ultimately, this comprehensive synthesis aims to serve as a resource for clinicians and researchers to accelerate the development of durable, precision-based treatment strategies in mCRPC.",

Recruiting and activating immune cells in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment is the key to reversing immune suppression and improving immunotherapy efficacy. In this study, biomimetic oxygen-delivering nanoparticles (CmPF) are engineered for homologous targeting and hypoxia alleviation within the tumor environment. CmPF targets the tumor microenvironment and delivers oxygen to reduce hypoxia, thereby promoting immune cell activity at the tumor site. In addition, granzyme B-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is employed to monitor immune cell activity changes in response to immunotherapy efficacy in vivo. The combination of CmPF with carboplatin and PD-1 inhibitors significantly suppresses tumor growth by 2.4-fold, exhibiting the potential of CmPF to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. Immunohistochemistry further confirms increased expression of key immune markers, highlighting the reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. This study demonstrates that hypoxia alleviation enhances tumor immunotherapy efficacy and introduces a non-invasive PET imaging method for dynamic, real-time assessment of therapeutic response.",

This approach, which relies on immune checkpoint modulation, has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear. Previously, we designed a bispecific antibody (BsAb) targeting PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) and the T cell immune checkpoint, LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene-3). In the present study, we evaluated the combination treatment of the BsAb (named Ba-PL) with doxorubicin (DOX) in a tumor-bearing mouse model and comprehensively investigated the underlying mechanisms involved. The animal experiments demonstrated that the Ba-PL exerted an anti-tumor effect. Notably, mice treated with a combination of Ba-PL and DOX exhibited superior antitumor responses, mediated by the induction of robust immune cytokine responses. Furthermore, our findings revealed that this combination therapy restored depleted T cell activity and reinstated immune surveillance against tumors by reducing regulatory T cell levels. This immunotherapy combination exhibited favorable safety profiles and effectively prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Blocking PD-L1 and LAG-3 in combination with doxorubicin is therapeutic potential approach for breast cancer and offers hope for improved patient outcomes.",

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a key focus in BC therapy because it plays a major role in important processes like tumor growth, survival, and resistance to treatment. Targeting this pathway could lead to better treatment options and outcomes. The present review explores how the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway becomes dysregulated in BC, focusing on the genetic changes like PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss that leads to its aggravation. Current treatment options include the use of inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT, and mTOR with combination therapies showing promise in overcoming drug resistance and improving effectiveness. Looking ahead, next-generation inhibitors and personalized treatment plans guided by biomarker analysis may provide more accurate and effective options for patients. Integrating these pathway inhibitors with immunotherapy offers an exciting opportunity to boost anti-tumor responses and improve survival rates.

    "abstract": "Patients with breast cancer (BC) who benefit from the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) is limited, necessitating novel strategies to improve immunotherapy efficacy of BC. Here we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of flaxseed lignans (FL) on the biological behaviors of BC and evaluate the roles of FL in enhancing the anticancer effects of PDi. HPLC was used to detect the content of enterolactone (ENL), the bacterial transformation product of FL. Transcript sequencing was performed and identified CD38 as a downstream target gene of ENL. CD38-overexpressing cells were constructed and cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays were used to assess the function of ENL/CD38 axis on BC cells in vitro. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and CyTOF were used to detect the changes of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). 16S rDNA sequencing was used to explore the changes of gut microbiota in mice. A series of in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the anticancer effects and mechanisms of FL and PDi. FL was converted to ENL by gut microbiota and FL administration inhibited the progression of BC. ENL inhibited the malignant behaviors of BC by downregulating CD38, a key gene associated with immunosuppression and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistance. The mIHC assay revealed that FL administration enhanced CD3 The FL/ENL/CD38 axis inhibited BC progression. FL enhanced the anticancer effects of PDi by modulating gut microbiota and host immunity.",

    "abstract": "Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a dismal prognosis; however, the introduction of atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination has improved overall survival and novel immune checkpoint inhibitors are entering the clinics. Despite more therapeutic options being available, no biomarker guides treatment choice. Indeed, tissue-based analyses and complex analytical procedures hinder clinical translation. We explored the informativeness of a simple, non-invasive, repeatable cytofluorimetric assay on peripheral blood to predict response and survival in HCC patients treated with atezolizumab-bevacizumab. Twenty-five cirrhotic patients, 50 HCC patients undergoing atezolizumab-bevacizumab and an independent validation cohort of 25 HCC patients were subjected to a cytofluorimetric study of peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) to assess baseline programmed death-ligand 1-positive (PD-L1+) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-positive (CTLA4+) cell percentage in the different populations and their early on-treatment variations. Immunophenotypes were evaluated against treatment response. RNA sequencing followed by RT-PCR validation were used to elucidate the molecular correlates of immunophenotypic observations. PD-L1+ cell percentage did not predict response either at baseline or when evaluating treatment-induced early changes. Conversely, the percentage of CTLA4+ lymphocytes at baseline showed a predictive significance (35.37 in responders versus 31.5 in non-responders, P\u00a0= 0.03). More interestingly, the early CTLA4+ changes during treatment in lymphocytes (responders 0.95 versus non-responders 1.08, P\u00a0= 0.05), monocytes (responders 0.95 versus non-responders 1.04, P\u00a0= 0.03), granulocytes (responders 0.94 versus non-responders 1.14, P\u00a0= 0.001) and, even stronger, the early CTLA4+ percentage change in the whole WBCs displayed a predictive significance in terms of time to progression (TTP) (P < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (P\u00a0= 0.005). The immunophenotypic findings correlated with transcriptional modulation of CTLA4 target genes and genes involved in immune response. A repeatable, easy, non-invasive blood test predicts response to immunotherapy in patients with HCC, both in terms of TTP and OS. CTLA4+ cell percentage increase in non-responders suggests a possible resistance mechanism which deserves attention as a druggable target.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), a pivotal enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, contributes to tumor progression through diverse biological activities like cell metabolism, angiogenesis, proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Although PGK1 has been intensively researched in specific cancer types, its overarching significance in pan-cancer contexts remains underexplored. This study leveraged various public database resources, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0), and cBioPortal, to analyze the gene expression, gene alteration characteristics, prognostic value, subcellular localization, biological function, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity of PGK1 in 33 different cancer types. R software was used to visualize these data. Furthermore, the effects of PGK1 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells were also examined in vitro using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, CCK-8 assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI assay, migration assay, and invasion assay. The findings suggested that PGK1 is upregulated in various cancer types and closely associated with poor prognosis. In terms of functional enrichment analysis, PGK1 primarily plays a role in glycolysis, hypoxia, EMT, and immune-related pathways. Furthermore, PGK1 is highly expressed in immune and malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. Notably, PGK1 expression varied significantly among immune cells with distinct activation states. The results of experiments in vitro showed that PGK1 was significantly upregulated in ESCC cells, and its knockdown led to significant inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion while increasing cell apoptosis; conversely, overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion while reducing apoptosis. PGK1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapy target for various cancers, and it may be a promising focal point of immunological studies.",

    "abstract": "The clinical success of the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the full potential of PD-1 blockade therapy remains unrealized, as response rates are still low across many cancer types. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapies hold promise, as they can stimulate robust T cell expansion and enhance effector function - activities that could synergize potently with PD-1 blockade. Yet, IL-2 therapies also carry a significant drawback: they can trigger severe systemic toxicities and induce immune suppression by expanding regulatory T cells. To overcome the challenges of PD-1 blockade and IL-2 therapies while enhancing safety and efficacy, we have engineered a novel fusion protein, AWT020, combining a humanized anti-PD-1 nanobody and an engineered IL-2 mutein (IL-2c). The IL-2c component of AWT020 has been engineered to exhibit no binding to the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R\u03b1) subunit and attenuated affinity for the IL-2 receptor beta and gamma (IL-2R\u03b2\u03b3) complex, aiming to reduce systemic immune cell activation, thereby mitigating the severe toxicity often associated with IL-2 therapies. The anti-PD-1 antibody portion of AWT020 serves a dual purpose: it precisely delivers the IL-2c payload to tumor-infiltrating T cells while blocking the immune-inhibitory signals mediated by the PD-1 pathway. AWT020 showed significantly enhanced pSTAT5 signaling in PD-1 expressing cells and promoted the proliferation of activated T cells over natural killer (NK) cells. In preclinical studies using both anti-PD-1-sensitive and -resistant mouse tumor models, the mouse surrogate of AWT020 (mAWT020) demonstrated markedly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy compared to an anti-PD-1 antibody, IL-2, or the combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody and IL-2. In addition, the mAWT020 treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal signs of toxicity. Immune profiling revealed that mAWT020 preferentially expands CD8 The AWT020 fusion protein offers a promising novel immunotherapeutic strategy by integrating PD-1 blockade and IL-2 signaling, conferring enhanced anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides. They do not encode proteins but are crucial in regulating gene expression and affecting the malignant biological behavior of cancer. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 10 (SNHG10) is a novel lncRNA that plays a regulatory role in many malignant tumors. Several recent studies have shown that SNHG10 is aberrantly expressed in various forms of cancer. This instability is closely related to important tumorigenic processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and chemotherapy resistance. SNHG10 has been reported to play a role through a variety of molecular mechanisms, including serving as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), regulating epigenetic processes, and affecting immune responses and tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, SNHG10 is involved in metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and chromatin remodeling, highlighting its diverse roles in tumor biology. Due to the specificity and selectivity of its expression level, the potential of SNHG10 as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target has attracted significant attention, and its correlation with the prognosis and treatment of various tumor types is of great significance. This review focuses on the biological function and molecular mechanism of SNHG10 and its relationship with various malignant tumors. In addition, this review highlights the potential of SNHG10 to improve precision oncology and develop novel cancer therapies by investigating its upstream regulators, downstream targets, and interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic processes.",

    "abstract": "Precision dosing of classical cytotoxic drugs in oncology remains underdeveloped, especially in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite advancements in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, classical cytotoxic agents continue to play a critical role in NSCLC treatment. However, the current body surface area (BSA)-based dosing of these agents fails to adequately address interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics. By better considering patient characteristics, treatment outcomes can be improved, reducing risks of under-exposure and over-exposure. This narrative review explores opportunities for precision dosing for key cytotoxic agents used in NSCLC treatment: cisplatin, carboplatin, pemetrexed, docetaxel, (nab-)paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine. A comprehensive review of regulatory reports and an extensive literature search were conducted to evaluate current dosing practices, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exposure-response relationships. Our findings highlight promising developments in precision dosing, although the number of directly implementable strategies remains limited. The most compelling evidence supports using the biomarker cystatin C for more precise carboplatin dosing and adopting weekly dosing schedules for docetaxel, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel. Additionally, we recommend direct implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided dosing for paclitaxel. This review stresses the urgent need to reassess conventional dosing paradigms for classical cytotoxic agents to better align with the principles of the precision dosing framework. Our recommendations show the potential of precision dosing to improve NSCLC treatment, addressing gaps in the current dosing of classical cytotoxic drugs. Given the large NSCLC patient population, optimising the dosing of these agents could significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce toxicity for many patients.",

Here we explored peripheral immune landscape, particularly the role of low-density granulocytes (LDGs). Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyzed peripheral immune cells from MG patients pre- (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and after treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a02), as well as healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Flow cytometry was employed for validating LDG subsets, and various functional assays were conducted to assess their impact on T cell proliferation and differentiation, NET formation, and ROS production. Single-cell analysis highlighted a shift towards inflammatory Th1/Th17/Tfh subsets, an intense interferon-mediated immune response, and an expansion of immature myeloid subsets in MG. Flow cytometry showed increased LDGs correlated with disease severity. Unlike myeloid-derived suppressor cells, MG LDGs do not restrict T cell proliferation but induce a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 response. They also display enhanced spontaneous neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation and basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. LDGs decreased after intravenous immunoglobulin and increased after prolonged immunotherapy in minimal manifestation status (MM), with reduced pro-inflammatory activity. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptional differences in LDGs, especially in cell cycle and granule protein genes. Peripheral immune profiling sheds light on the intricate role of LDGs in MG. These cells, as a distinct subtype of neutrophils with a proinflammatory phenotype, are notable increased in MG, exacerbating chronic inflammation. Furthermore, immunotherapy expanded LDGs but reduced their proinflammatory capacities. The complex interplay of LDGs in MG underscores their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

MCAM expression was analyzed by TCGA and GEO databases. qRT-PCR and IHC analysis were conducted to validate MCAM expression in patient tissues. The tumor-inhibiting ability of MCAM was further assessed by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and wound-healing assay. qRT-PCR and WB analysis were conducted to evaluate the expression of EMT markers and MMP2/9. qRT-PCR analysis was utilized to detect the polarization status of macrophages. Kaplan-Meier curve, univariate, and multivariate cox analyses were employed to verify the ability of MCAM in prognosis prediction. TIDE scores were used to assess the impact of MCAM on immunotherapy. The expression of MCAM was significantly downregulated in CRC, and low MCAM expression revealed poor prognosis in CRC patients. Moreover, MCAM overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasive ability of CRC cells. Additionally, MCAM overexpression suppressed N-cadherin and MMP2/9 expression. Furthermore, MCAM impacted M1 macrophage polarization. MCAM is an independent predictor of CRC patient prognosis through Cox regression analysis. Lastly, TIDE score analysis indicated that elevated expression of MCAM increased immunotherapy efficacy. The findings of this research suggest that MCAM impacts M1 macrophage polarization and enhances immunotherapy efficacy, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) affects tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, and therapies. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that ferroptosis plays important regulatory roles in tumourigenesis and progression. It is unclear how ferroptosis affects non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression by remodeling the TME. In this study, the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (85,562 cells, n\u2009=\u200918) were employed to reveal the heterogeneity of ferroptosis activation in NSCLC, and identified six ferroptosis-related molecular clusters. We found that ANXA1+ epithelial and FABP4 +\u2009TAM subpopulations were key factors in lung cancer progression and TME remodeling. In addition, the cell-cell communication analysis showed that ANXA1-FPR2/FPR1 receptor-ligand pair contributed to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, we established a novel signature based on ferroptosis-related molecular clusters, and the risk score model may predict survival and response to immunotherapy. We also found that compared with responder, the expression of ANXA1 and FABP4 is higher in progressor, which indicating a higher expression of ANXA1 and FABP4 was associated with a worse response to immunotherapy. Therefore, we concluded that the molecular clusters associated with ferroptosis served as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for NSCLC patients.",

Notably, while anti-PD-1 therapy alone achieved a cure rate of approximately 30% in a mouse model of colon cancer, the combined administration of exosomal miR-125b-5p significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy, resulting in a more than two- to three-fold increase in tumor regression in approximately 80% of the treated mice. The underlying cellular mechanism was closely associated with the reduction of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. and the increase of CD8 In summary, our findings suggest that exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from MSC exerts prominent potential in advancing anti-PD-1 therapy by modulating tumor immune environment. This property of miR-125b-5p may be therapeutically harnessed in human cancers to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy worldwide. This study aimed to explore the molecular subtypes and improve the selection of targeted therapies. We used multi-omics data from 539 patients with DNA methylation, gene mutations, mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA expressions. This study employed consensus clustering algorithms to identify molecular subtypes and used various bioinformatics tools to analyze genetic alterations, signaling pathways, immune infiltration, and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Two prognostically relevant TC subtypes, CS1 and CS2, were identified. CS2 was associated with a poorer prognosis of shorter progression-free survival times (P\u2009<\u20090.001). CS1 exhibited higher copy number alterations but a lower tumor mutation burden than CS2. CS2 exhibited activation in cell proliferation and immune-related pathways. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated CS2's higher sensitivity to cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and sunitinib, whereas CS1 was more sensitive to bicalutamide and FH535. The different activated pathways and sensitivity to drugs for the subtypes were further validated in an external cohort. Twenty-four paired tumors and adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemical staining further demonstrated the prognostic value of CXCL17. In conclusion, we identified two distinct molecular subtypes of TC with significant implications for prognosis, genetic alterations, pathway activation, and treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is recognized for intrinsic heterogeneity, although it is similarly approached in Europe and Latin America (LATAM). The LEGACY project aimed to deepen GC molecular understanding through multi-omics analysis in Europe and LATAM GC samples. Tumor samples were centrally reviewed for histology, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) status. In addition, we assessed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS), and carried out tissue genomic profiling including tumor mutation burden (TMB) quantification plus targeted transcriptomics for immune microenvironment and cancer cell signaling scores. In total, 328 GC patients were enrolled. HER2-positive GC and high PD-L1 CPS were more frequent in Europe than in LATAM (9% versus 3% and 15% versus 3%, respectively), whereas EBV was mainly found in LATAM (7%, versus 3% in Europe), and dMMR/MSI tumors were equally distributed (16%). High TMB was enriched in dMMR/MSI and EBV tumors. Mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes were frequent in both cohorts (24.8% and 14.7% in Europe and LATAM, respectively), and mostly found in dMMR/MSI (63.6%) and intestinal HER2-negative (18.7%) tumors. The prognosis was poor in diffuse HER2-negative GC patients, whose tumors presented an immunosuppressive microenvironment and other distinct pathway activation signatures. Our findings relate specific molecular alterations of GC tumors from Europe and LATAM to actionable biomarkers for precision cancer therapies. The proposed GC stratification can be implemented in routine care and guide drug development strategies.",

Little is known about NSCLC harboring ERBB2 mutations in Latin America. This study aimed to characterize the real-world clinical characteristics and outcomes of ERBB2-mutant NSCLC in Latin America. Patients with NSCLC harboring ERBB2 mutations detected by next-generation sequencing in tumors or cfDNA were identified in databanks from 3 Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico). Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Of 1245 patients with NSCLC included from January 2015 to September 2022, 35 (2.8%) patients had tumors with ERBB2 mutations. The median age was 60 years (IQR: 49-69), 54.2% of patients were females, 59.4% were never smokers, 51.3% had baseline performance status ECOG 0, 91.5% were diagnosed with stage IV disease, and 29.7% had de novo brain metastasis. The most common ERBB2 mutations were A775_G776insYVMA (40%) and G780_P781dupGSP (20%). The most often co-mutated gene was TP53 (17.1%), and the median tumor mutation burden was 2 mut/Mb (IQR: 1-4). PD-L1 tumor proportion score was \u226550%, 1%-49%, and <1% in 11.4%, 54.2%, and 31.4%, respectively. Regarding treatment patterns, 74.2% of patients received chemotherapy (CT) plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in the first line, and 42.8% received antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting ERBB2 in further lines of therapy, especially trastuzumab emtansine (37.1%) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.7%). The median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) to the first line was 6.7 months (95%CI, 5.65-8.48). The median real-world overall survival (rwOS) for the entire cohort was 25.9 months (95% CI, 24.4-27.9). This study demonstrated that ERBB2-mutant NSCLC is uncommon among Latin American patients. Despite the vast majority of patients being treated with chemo-immunotherapy (ICB) in the first line, the median rwOS was similar to that reported for non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The asymptomatic progression of early-stage HCC often results in diagnosis at advanced stages, significantly limiting therapeutic options and worsening prognosis. Immunotherapy, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) at the forefront, has revolutionized HCC treatment. Nevertheless, tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the presence of immunosuppressive components within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) continue to compromise its efficacy. Furthermore, resistance or non-responsiveness to ICIs in some patients underscores the urgent need to unravel the complexities of the TIME and to design innovative strategies that enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes. Emerging evidence has revealed the pivotal role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a prominent RNA methylation modification, in shaping the TIME in HCC. By regulating RNA stability and translation, m6A influences immune-related factors, including cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. This modification governs PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune escape and contributing to resistance against ICIs. Advances in this field have also identified m6A-related regulators as promising biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response and as potential therapeutic targets for optimizing treatment efficacy. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms of m6A modification within the TIME of HCC, with a focus on its impact on immune cells and cytokine dynamics. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A pathways to improve immunotherapy efficacy and outlines emerging directions for future research. These insights aim to provide a foundation for developing novel strategies to overcome immune resistance and advance HCC treatment.",

Since myeloid-related suppressive factors are associated with poor responses to ICI in a subgroup of HCC patients, modulation of these targets may improve response rates. Our aim was to characterize the expression of the efferocytosis receptor MERTK in HCC and to analyze its potential as a new therapeutic target. In HCC patients, MERTK was expressed by myeloid cells and was associated with poorer survival. In a murine HCC model with progressive myeloid cell infiltration, MERTK was detected in dendritic cells and macrophages with an activated phenotype, which overexpressed the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. Concomitant expression of PD-1 in tumor T-cells suggested the pertinence of combined PD-1/PD-L1 and MERTK blockade. In vivo experiments in mice showed that inhibition of MERTK improved the therapeutic effect promoted by anti-PD-1 or by ICI combinations currently approved for HCC. This effect was associated with enhanced tumor infiltration and superior activity of antigen presenting cells and effector lymphocytes. Our results indicate that MERTK may behave as a relevant target for immunotherapeutic combinations in those HCC patients with tumors enriched in a myeloid component.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constituting 85% of cases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represented by anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/ programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have emerged as a promising frontier in cancer treatment, effectively extending the survival of patients with NSCLC. However, the efficacy of ICIs exhibits significant variability across diverse patient populations, with a substantial proportion showing poor responsiveness and acquired resistance in those initially responsive to ICIs treatments. With the advancement of nanotechnology, nanoparticles offer unique advantages in tumor immunotherapy, including high permeability and prolonged retention(EPR) effects, enhanced drug delivery and stability, and modulation of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment(TME). This review summarizes the mechanisms of resistance to ICIs in NSCLC, focusing on tumor antigens loss and defective antigen processing and presentation, failure T cell priming, impaired T cell migration and infiltration, immunosuppressive TME, and genetic mutations. Furthermore, we discuss how nanoparticles, through their intrinsic properties such as the EPR effect, active targeting effect, shielding effect, self-regulatory effect, and synergistic effect, can potentiate the efficacy of ICIs and reverse resistance. In conclusion, nanoparticles serve as a robust platform for ICIs-based NSCLC therapy, aiding in overcoming resistance challenges.",

Moreover, we investigated the function of UBC9 in tumor cells using a knockdown assay. UBC9 expression level was significantly elevated in the tumor tissues of patients with PTC, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that UBC9 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis.

    "title": "Unlocking the therapeutic potential of antibody-drug conjugates in targeting molecular biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevalent and lethal malignancy worldwide, posing significant challenges to patient survival. Recent advancements in the field of oncology have introduced immunotherapy and targeted therapy as primary treatment modalities for NSCLC. However, the emergence of treatment resistance and relapse has impeded their long-term effectiveness. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a rapidly evolving class of anti-cancer agents, offer a promising solution to this issue by harnessing the specificity of monoclonal antibodies and the cytotoxic potency of drug payloads. ADCs have demonstrated notable potential in targeting both highly expressing and low-expressing malignant cells, with early-phase clinical trials yielding superior survival outcomes in NSCLC patients. This review comprehensively outlines the recent advancements in ADC-based strategies for managing NSCLC, supported by evidence from clinical trials. Additionally, the review delves into the oncogenic mechanisms of various biomarkers and offers insights into strategies for their detection in NSCLC patients. Lastly, a forward-looking perspective is provided to address the challenges associated with the utilization of ADCs in NSCLC therapy.",

    "abstract": "The management of melanoma has evolved significantly over the past decade with the advent of immunotherapies and BRAF/MEK inhibitors, which have changed the prognosis for patients with advanced disease. Having demonstrated their efficacy in advanced disease, these treatments have been evaluated and shown to be effective in adjuvant treatment at earlier stages, first in stage III and then in stage IIB-IIC. Alongside the development of these adjuvant treatments, which have become the standard of care, new therapeutic strategies have emerged. Neoadjuvant treatments have been shown to be superior to adjuvant treatments in phase II and III trials. These neoadjuvant strategies will undoubtedly become the new standard for patients with macroscopic lymph node disease. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the optimal treatment regimen. Should mono- or bi-immunotherapy be used? Can surgery be de-escalated? Is additional adjuvant treatment essential or can it be withheld in the event of a major pathological response? Should patients with BRAFV600 mutations switch to targeted therapies in the event of pathological non-response? Should we switch to targeted therapies in the event of pathological non-response in BRAFV600 mutant patients? Therapeutic strategies, which are becoming increasingly personalised, are evolving very rapidly, with a trend towards de-escalation. We still lack robust biomarkers for patient selection.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which limits the effectiveness of current immunotherapies. Identifying strategies to overcome this resistance is critical for improving treatment outcomes. In this study, we discovered that USP19 plays a pivotal role in regulating T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity through a CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library screen and co-culture assays with activated T cells. We demonstrated that USP19 deficiency significantly enhances the susceptibility to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in CRC cells, organoids, and mouse models. Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed activation of the PD-1 pathway in tumor with USP19-deficiency cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that USP19 directly stabilizes PD-L1 by binding to its intracellular domain and preventing its degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways. Clinically, USP19 expression was found to be significantly elevated in CRC tissues and was positively associated with PD-L1 levels, advanced tumor grade, poor differentiation, and TP53 mutations, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for aggressive CRC. Importantly, in vivo experiments demonstrated that targeting USP19, in combination with \u03b1PD-L1 therapy, synergistically suppressed CRC progression. This combination not only reduced PD-L1 levels but also enhanced CD8",

    "abstract": "N7-methylguanosine (m7G) methylation is an RNA modification associated with cancer progression, but its specific role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear. This study analyzed the differential expression of m7G-related genes (m7GRGs) in HNSCC using the TCGA-HNSCC dataset, identifying key pathways associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication, and focal adhesion. A LASSO-Cox regression model was constructed based on four m7GRGs (EIF3D, EIF1, LARP1, and METTL1) and validated with GEO datasets and clinical samples. Further validation of gene upregulation in HNSCC tissues was conducted using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, while the role of LARP1 in HNSCC cells was assessed via knockout experiments. The constructed model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the risk score significantly correlating with prognosis, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. An external dataset and clinical specimens further confirmed the model's predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response. Additionally, two regulatory axes-LINC00707/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1 and SNHG16/hsa-miR-30b-5p/LARP1-were identified. LARP1 knockout experiments revealed that suppressing LARP1 markedly inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The m7GRG-based prognostic model developed in this study holds strong clinical potential for predicting prognosis and therapeutic responses in HNSCC. The identification of LARP1 and its related regulatory pathways offers new avenues for targeted therapy in HNSCC.",

Significant advancements have been made in targeted therapy and immunotherapy for this gene in recent years, underscoring the importance of comprehensively understanding the genomic landscape of KRAS across various cancer types. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a panel of 520 genes, KRAS mutations, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI-H) status were investigated. An analysis of 10,820 tumor samples found KRAS mutations in 19.97% of cases. Pancreatic cancer showed the highest prevalence of KRAS mutations at 73.51%, while colorectal at 41.45%, uterine at 21.23%, and lung cancer at 11.24%. KRAS G12D mutation is most common in pancreatic, colorectal, and gastric cancers, while KRAS G12V mutation is predominant in uterine cancer, and KRAS G12C mutation is most frequent in lung cancer. Significant correlations were found between TMB and KRAS G13D/G12V mutations in colorectal cancer. KRAS G13D notably affected TMB in uterus cancer, while KRAS G12C mutation was linked to high TMB in lung cancer. Moreover, statistical analysis revealed a significant association between KRAS G13D/G12V mutations and MSI-H in colorectal cancer. KRAS mutations were most frequent in cancers of the digestive, female reproductive, and respiratory systems. Specific KRAS mutations are associated with TMB and MSI in various cancer types.",

However, the specific functional role of CAFs in HNSCC has been inadequately explored. In this study, we utilized a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from HNSCC (GSE103322) to recluster CAFs via the Seurat pipeline. On the basis of the reported markers, we identified two CAF subtypes, LOX-myCAFs and LOX\u2009+\u2009iCAFs, and generated signature markers for each. Through unsupervised consensus clustering, we identified and characterized two molecular subtypes of HNSCC-TCGA, each exhibiting distinct dysregulated cancer hallmarks, immunological tumor microenvironments, and stemness characteristics. The robustness of the LOX\u2009+\u2009iCAF-related signature clustering, particularly in terms of prognosis and prediction of immunotherapeutic response, was validated in an ANOVA cohort via a GEO dataset (GSE159067) consisting of 102 HNSCC patients. A positive correlation was validated between the expression of LOX and that of CD86, a marker of M1 macrophage polarization. Further experiments involving the coculture of conditioned medium derived from LOX-silenced CAFs with CAL-27 and UM-SCC-1 cell lines revealed that LOX silencing led to decreased proliferation and migration of these cancer cells, which was mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through IL-34- induced CSF1R/Akt signaling. In summary, our single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed a LOX\u2009+\u2009iCAF-related signature that can predict the prognosis and response to immunotherapy in HNSCC patients. Additionally, the LOX gene was identified as a promising therapeutic target for HNSCC treatment.",

Emerging biomarkers are significantly improving outcomes in hematological cancers by enhancing early detection, refining prognostic assessments, enabling personalized treatment approaches, and optimizing overall patient management. This progress translates into better clinical outcomes and more effective strategies to treat and manage malignancies. The field of biomarker discovery has developed from basic morphological and cytogenetic markers to advanced molecular techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), which have significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy and led to the development of targeted therapies. Additionally, the recent advent of technologies like mass spectrometry and single-cell RNA sequencing enables comprehensive molecular profiling and reveals novel biomarkers that were previously undetectable.

Guidelines recommend its use for treating G/GEJ cancers. However, targeted therapy did not significantly improve survival outcomes compared to those with neoadjuvant therapy. The KEYNOTE-811 trial revealed an improved objective response rate (74% vs. 52%; P=.0001) and median duration of response (10.6 vs 9.5 months) with the addition of pembrolizumab (PD-1) to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab compared to that with the addition of placebo in patients with HER-2 overexpression-positive advanced adenocarcinoma. Therefore, addition of PD-1 to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab may lead to a better response in patients with G/GEJ cancer. A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with stage III GEJ adenocarcinoma with celiac lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemical results indicated HER-2(3+) and PD-L1 CPS=5. The patient received three cycles of pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy preoperatively and underwent radical surgery on November 22, 2022. Patients with HER-2-positive locally advanced GEJ cancers received PD-1 immunotherapy combined with trastuzumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved a complete pathological response. Hence, it is a novel, highly specific, and potent therapeutic option for HER-2-positive patients and should henceforth be considered as a new treatment approach.",

    "abstract": "Photo-immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non-specific distribution and the subsequent immune-related adverse events. Meanwhile, high-performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light-harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win-win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high-powered photo-immunotherapy systems. Specifically, the phototheranostic agent (AOTTIT) displaying typical aggregation-induced fluorescence extending to the second near-infrared II window, as well as outstanding reactive oxygen species and heat production capacity is first obtained via ingenious design. Notably, AOTTIT exhibits a record high molar extinction coefficient among the reported organic multimodal phototheranostic molecules. Meanwhile, PD-1 genetically engineered cancer cell membrane-derived nanovesicles (PD-1/CMNVs) are prepared as both nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents to camouflage AOTTIT nanoparticles, yielding a multifunctional photo-immunotherapeutic agent (CMNPs/PD-1) with tumor-specific active and homologous targeting ability. The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo-immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win-win strategy.",

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key contributors to tumor progression, therapy resistance, and immunosuppression. In this study, mRNA sequencing and clinical data from SKCM samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to evaluate the prognostic significance, therapeutic implications, and potential for enhancing immunotherapy through targeting CAFs in SKCM. A CAF-related risk model comprising nine genes was developed, revealing that patients classified as low-risk exhibited superior survival outcomes and increased sensitivity to immunotherapy. Spearman correlation analysis identified significant associations between the risk score and the sensitivity to 40 drugs, as well as resistance to 17 drugs. Additionally, CAFs were categorized into three distinct subgroups in SKCM, with antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) notably suppressing the infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells and strongly correlating with poor prognosis. In summary, the CAF-related risk model offers a robust prognostic tool for SKCM, capable of predicting both survival outcomes and therapeutic sensitivity. Moreover, the pivotal role of apCAFs within the immune microenvironment suggests that targeting these cells may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

We employed these scaffolds to design proteins that bind to TGF\u03b2RII, CTLA-4, and PD-L1, achieving low nanomolar to picomolar affinities and potent biological activity following experimental optimization. Co-crystal structures of the TGF\u03b2RII and CTLA-4 binders in complex with their respective receptors closely match the design models.

    "abstract": "Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) has emerged as a highly selective biomarker and its abnormal expression has been reported in various primary malignant tumors. Recently, CLDN18.2 has gained attention as both a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate CLDN18.2 expression in a large cohort of 168 prostate cancer (PC) tissues, assess its correlation with clinicopathological factors, and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target for anti-CLDN18.2 therapy. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted using an approved diagnostic CLDN18.2 immunohistochemistry protocol (Ventana, 43-14A clone). Interpretation was carried out following the general rules for staining evaluation. Non-neoplastic gastric mucosa, used as a positive control for CLDN18.2 immunostaining, exhibited strong membranous staining. In contrast, no CLDN18.2 expression was detected in normal ductal and acinar cells of prostate tissue, nor in any of the 168 variable PC tissues. CLDN18.2 is not expressed in normal prostate tissue or PC, suggesting that it is unlikely to serve as a prognostic marker or a potential target for immunotherapy in PC.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), but response rates remain heterogeneous, and reliable predictive biomarkers are lacking. Recent studies suggest that androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a role in regulating CD8 We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 185 patients with mRCC who received ICIs. Patients were stratified based on their history of 5-ARI use. Baseline characteristics included age, body mass index, International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, tumor stage, and metastasis sites. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Key immunological insights were gained through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of tumor samples. Patients with a history of 5-ARI use demonstrated improved ORR (59.8% vs 39.8%, p=0.0075) and DCR (87.0% vs 78.7%, p=0.1747) compared with those without. The median PFS and OS were significantly longer in the 5-ARI group, with HRs of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.86, p=0.0085) for PFS and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.90, p=0.0271) for OS. Subgroup analysis further indicated enhanced ICI efficacy with 5-ARI use across age, IMDC risk scores, and PD-L1 expression levels. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 5-ARI treated patients exhibited a reduced presence of regulatory T cells and CD8 T-cell exhaustion (CD8 Tex), and lower programmed cell death protein-1 expression in CD8 Tex cells, suggesting an immunologically favorable modification of the tumor. A history of 5-ARI use is associated with improved responses to ICI therapy in mRCC, potentially through AR-related modulation of CD8",

    "abstract": "Antiangiogenics combined with immune checkpoint blockade have become standard of care for recurrent endometrial cancer after standard platinum-based chemotherapy. To dissect mechanisms and define biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes to these combinations, we applied multidimensional immune monitoring to peripheral blood specimens collected from a randomized phase 2 trial of nivolumab with or without cabozantinib in 75 evaluable patients with recurrent endometrial cancer (NCI ETCTN 10104, NCT03367741). This trial demonstrated superiority of the combination to nivolumab alone. Using Olink proteomics, mass cytometry, tumor antigen-specific ELISA, and whole exome tumor sequencing, we identified longitudinal immune signatures specific to cabozantinib use, including an increase in plasma HO-1 and reduction in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, interleukin-12, and circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Prior exposure to immunotherapy and carcinosarcoma histology had no adverse impact on clinical benefit or biomarkers, and copy-number high tumors were associated with increased plasma granzymes on combination treatment. Higher baseline plasma levels of myeloid-related markers (chemokine ligand 23/CCL23, colony-stimulating factor-1/macrophage colony-stimulating factor/CSF1) were associated with poor overall and progression-free survival, and lack of clinical benefit (defined as progressive or stable disease <6 months) following combination treatment (Kaplan-Meier, multivariate Cox, false discover rate <0.05). Patients with favorable outcomes had higher levels of activated T-cell markers (plasma ICOS-L, CD28) and exhibited spontaneous autoantibody titers to tumor antigen NY-ESO-1. Patients experiencing severe adverse events from the combination therapy had higher baseline levels of neutrophil-derived markers (CXCL1). Overall, this study highlights potential resistance and response mechanisms to nivolumab+cabozantinib\u2009and suggests prioritizing combination treatment in patients with activated T-cell immunogenicity profiles while exploring future combinatorial therapies targeting myeloid populations to overcome resistance.",

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly aggressive malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that hinders effective immune responses. A key feature of this environment is the extensive infiltration of myeloid cells, which contributes to immune evasion. This study explored how mesothelin (MSLN), a tumor-associated antigen, modulates the expression of CD24, an emerging target for immune modulation, and its role in promoting immune evasion in HGSOC. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies and improving outcomes in patients with HGSOC. We analyzed the expression of MSLN in HGSOC samples and examined its correlation with clinical outcome. In vitro and in vivo models were used to explore how MSLN influences CD24 expression and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We also investigated the role of MSLN in the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and its impact on T-cell function and antitumor immunity. The effects of  MSLN expression was found to be significantly elevated in HGSOC, with high MSLN levels correlating with poor prognosis and resistance to ICB. MSLN upregulated CD24 and promoted the protumorigenic polarization of TAMs, contributing to T-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, MSLN activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, which in turn enhanced CD24 expression. This activation forms a positive feedback loop that further promotes MSLN transcription. In contrast,  This study elucidates the critical role of MSLN in immune evasion in HGSOC and its underlying mechanisms. Targeting MSLN in combination with ICB is a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes in HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in treatment modalities, several patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death process, holds substantial promise for tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we explored the use of pyroptosis to overcome immunotherapy resistance in CRC. We used a pyroptosis-related gene panel to construct an immunotherapy efficacy evaluation model and validated its performance by immunohistochemical staining of CRC patient samples. Pyroptosis and its underlying mechanisms were examined both in vitro and in vivo using PCR, western blotting, lactate dehydrogenase release assay, ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence cell assays, microscopic imaging, flow cytometry analysis and bioinformatics approaches. We established a model to define high or low levels of pyroptosis in CRC, revealed that low pyroptosis led to immunotherapy resistance, and identified KIAA1199 as a characteristic protein of low pyroptosis CRC. We further demonstrated that KIAA1199 contributes to low pyroptosis, resulting in resistance to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 bound to and stabilized DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1), thereby inhibiting GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Importantly, our study highlighted that decitabine reversed KIAA1199-mediated immunotherapy resistance by enhancing pyroptosis to restore IL-1B release and CD8 We found a critical role of KIAA1199 in promoting immunotherapy resistance by suppressing pyroptosis via the DNMT1/GSDME pathway in CRC. Decitabine has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for reversing KIAA1199-mediated immunotherapy resistance by enhancing pyroptosis. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with CRC who exhibit resistance to conventional immunotherapy approaches.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we conducted an in-depth analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with mitochondrial depolarisation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using single-cell sequencing. By combining our findings with cuproptosis-related genes, we identified 10 significant risk genes: DCN, PTHLH, CRYAB, HMGCS1, DSG3, ZFP36L2, SCAND1, NUDT4, NDUFA4L2 and RPL36A, using univariate Cox regression analysis and machine learning methods. These genes form the core of our prognosis risk prediction model, which demonstrated high specificity and accuracy in predicting patient outcomes, as evidenced by ROC curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves further confirmed that patients in the low-risk group had significantly better survival rates compared to those in the high-risk group. Our models also provided valuable insights into the tumour microenvironment, immunotherapy sensitivity and chemotherapy response. To facilitate the quantification of the probability of patient survival, we incorporated clinical data into a nomogram. We comprehensively analysed the mutation status and expression patterns of the 10 risk genes using bulk transcriptomic, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets. Drug target predictions highlighted DSG3, PTHLH, ZFP36L2, DCN and NDUFA4L2 as promising therapeutic targets. Notably, RPL36A emerged as a potential tumour marker for NSCLC, with its expression validated in lung cancer cell lines through qPCR. This study has established a predictive models based on mitochondrial depolarisation genes associated with cuproptosis, aiding clinicians in forecasting overall survival and guiding personalised treatment strategies. The identification of novel tumour markers has paved the way for targeted therapies, and therapeutic targets are critical for advancing the treatment of NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows limited response to chemotherapy, partly due to the absence of effective biomarkers for personalized treatment. Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations are found in 90% of PDAC cases, and tumors dependent on KRAS (dKRAS) can be identified using gene expression signature scores. Previous research indicates that dKRAS-PDAC cells are sensitive to decitabine (DEC), an FDA-approved drug for hematological cancers, though its use in solid tumors is limited by side effects. We discovered that low-dose DEC combined with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib (OLA) enhances antitumor activity in dKRAS-PDAC. DEC induces DNA damage and activates the ataxia telangiectasia (ATR)/ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage response (DDR), with PARP1-mediated repair playing a key role. Inhibiting PARP with OLA further improves efficacy, even in BRCA1/2-wild-type and homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors but not in KRAS-independent tumors. The combination was especially effective in dKRAS-PDAC with a BRCA2 mutation, preventing metastasis growth. Our results support the clinical evaluation of DEC+OLA in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal carcinoma, a type of head and neck cancer (HNC), is an emerging malignancy associated with low survival rates. It typically affects older males and correlates with smoking, drinking, and lower socioeconomic conditions. Traditional treatments such as surgery have often yielded limited outcomes. However, recent insights, particularly those emphasized by Dr Teknos in his Keynote Conference at MedNews Week, have sparked a deeper exploration into alternative and more promising treatment methods. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore this subject further. One such approach, demonstrated by the UMCC 9921 trial, involves a comprehensive protocol starting with induction chemotherapy. This initial phase aims to reduce tumor burden and assess response to treatment. Based on the individual outcomes, patients then undergo concurrent chemoradiation or salvage surgery. This strategy has significantly improved survival rates, especially in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive patients, showcasing the potential of tailored treatments. While these advancements are promising, long-term complications such as dysphagia and osteoradionecrosis remain a cause of concern. The rise of HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has further changed how risk factors and treatment outcomes are viewed. HPV-positive cancers have unique characteristics and respond well to modern therapies. Researchers are investigating biomarkers such as circulating HPV DNA and immunoglobulin J polypeptide expression, which could provide valuable insights into disease progression and pave the way for more targeted and effective treatment strategies. In addition, the use of existing medications, such as fenofibrate, to combat HPV infections illustrates the resourcefulness in repurposing specific treatments. Challenges persist, especially in the need for reliable biomarkers for early disease progression detection and monitoring. Deeper insights into viral-host interactions shape promising immunotherapy strategies that could revolutionize treatment approaches. Collaborative efforts between researchers, healthcare providers, and policymakers play a vital role in translating these advancements into substantial clinical benefits, improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by HPV-related diseases. While HPV-associated HNCs present significant challenges, continuous research and innovative treatments offer hope for a brighter future in combating this growing epidemic and improving patient care.",

    "abstract": "With the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in B-cell malignancies, efforts are being made to extend this therapy to other malignancies and broader patient populations. However, limitations associated with the time-consuming and highly personalized manufacturing of autologous CAR T-cells remain. Allogeneic CAR T-cell approaches may overcome these challenges but require further engineering to reduce their alloreactivity. As a means to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of allogeneic CAR T-cells, we have selected a micro RNA (miRNA)-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting CD3\u03b6 which efficiently downregulates the expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) below detection level. We generated allogeneic anti-B-cell maturation antigen CAR T-cells (CYAD-211) that co-express an anti-CD3\u03b6 miRNA-based shRNA within the CAR construct which efficiently inhibited TCR-mediated signaling in vitro and GvHD in vivo. CYAD-211 was subsequently evaluated in a Phase-I clinical trial (NCT04613557), in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. No signs of GvHD were observed despite evidence of engraftment, demonstrating efficient downregulation of the TCR. Our data provide proof of concept that a non-gene-edited technology can generate fully functional allogeneic CAR T-cells, without any signs of GvHD. However, further engineering of the CAR T-cells is needed to improve their persistence and long-term activity.",

    "abstract": "Canopy FGF signaling regulator 2 (CNPY2) has emerged as a crucial player in cancer development by promoting cell proliferation, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. This review synthesizes the current understanding of CNPY2's role in solid tumors, particularly renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. CNPY2 modulates key pathways such as p53, MYLIP, NF-\u03baB, and AKT/GSK3\u03b2, thereby driving tumor growth and progression. In renal cell carcinoma, CNPY2 paradoxically promotes tumor growth through p53 upregulation, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, CNPY2 drives cell cycle progression via p53 destabilization. In prostate cancer, it enhances tumor progression by stabilizing androgen receptors through MYLIP interaction, and in non-small-cell lung cancer, it contributes to chemoresistance and metastasis through NF-\u03baB and AKT/GSK3\u03b2 signaling. Additionally, CNPY2 influences the tumor microenvironment, impacting immune function and metastatic potential. As a potential biomarker, CNPY2 shows promise for cancer detection and prognosis, particularly when used in combination with other markers. Early therapeutic strategies, including siRNA and miRNA approaches, are under exploration, though challenges remain due to CNPY2's expression in normal tissues and potential off-target effects. This review underscores the need for further research to fully elucidate CNPY2's oncogenic mechanisms and develop targeted therapies. Improved understanding of CNPY2's diverse roles may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma remains a major obstacle in achieving effective and durable treatment outcomes, highlighting the need to understand and address the underlying mechanisms. The first key factor is innate anti-PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES), an expression of a group of genes associated with tumor plasticity and immune evasion. IPRES promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing melanoma cells' invasiveness and survival. Overexpressed AXL, TWIST2, and WNT5a induce phenotypic changes. The upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines frequently coincides with EMT-related changes, further promoting a resistant and aggressive tumor phenotype. Inflamed tumor microenvironment may also drive the expression of resistance. The complexity of immune resistance development suggests that combination therapies are necessary to overcome it. Furthermore, targeting epigenetic regulation and exploring novel approaches such as miR-146a modulation may provide new strategies to counter resistance in melanoma.",

    "title": "Combining molecular characteristics and therapeutic analysis of PDOs predict clinical responses and guide PDAC personalized treatment.",
    "abstract": "The emergence of targeted therapies and immunotherapy has broadened treatment options for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Despite this, traditional drug selection, predominantly relies on tumor markers and clinical staging, has underutilized these drugs due to ignoring patient genomic diversity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and corresponding patient-derived organoid xenograft (PDOX) models offer a way to better understand and address this. In this study, we established PDOs and PDOX models from PDAC clinical samples. These models were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, H&E staining, and genomic profiling. Drug screening with 111 FDA-approved drugs was performed on PDOs, and drug responses in PDOs and PDOX models were compared to assess consistency with clinical treatment outcomes. Gene analysis was conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying variations in drug responses. Additionally, by analyzing the sequencing results from various drug-sensitive groups, the identified differential gene-drug metabolism gene UGT1A10 were modulated in PDOs to evaluate its impact on drug efficacy. A co-culture system of PDOs with immune cells was developed to study the efficacy of immunotherapies. PDOs and matched PDOX models retain the morphological, biological, and genomic characteristics of the primary tumor. Exome sequencing and RNA sequencing confirmed both the consistency and heterogeneity among the PDOs. High-throughput drug screening revealed significant variability in drug sensitivity across different organoids, yet PDOs and PDOX derived from the same patient exhibited a high degree of concordance in response to clinical chemotherapy agents. The gene expression analysis of PDOs with significant differences in drug sensitivity revealed UGT1A10 as a crucial regulator. The knockdown of UGT1A10 notably increased drug sensitivity. Furthermore, immune cells demonstrated specific cytotoxicity towards the organoids, underscoring the potential of the co-culture system for application in tumor immunotherapy. Our results highlight the necessity for personalized treatment strategies that consider genomic diversity beyond tumor markers, thus validating the utility of PDOs and PDOX models in advancing PDAC research and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is an aggressive, chemoresistant non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype with poor patient outcomes linked to elevated PD-L1 expression. This study investigates miRNA-mediated regulation of PD-L1, focusing on miR-340-5p and miR-424-5p as novel therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers for pembrolizumab response. Through miRNA sequencing and functional assays, miR-340-5p and miR-424-5p were identified as key modulators of PD-L1 in drug-resistant ENKTL cells, with their roles validated via ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. Notably, elevated miR-340-5p levels in PD-L1-negative ENKTL tissues were inversely correlated with soluble PD-L1, implicating miR-340-5p in immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, low serum levels of miR-340-5p were associated with reduced pembrolizumab efficacy, positioning miR-340-5p as a promising predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade. These findings suggest that pre-treatment assessment of serum miR-340-5p could guide pembrolizumab therapy in ENKTL, optimizing treatment outcomes. Validation in larger cohorts is necessary to confirm the utility of miR-340-5p as a predictive biomarker for ENKTL immunotherapy.",

To assess the occurrence of late AEs for adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) treated with commercially available CD19-targeted CAR T cells. A prospective, observational, clinical practice cohort study was conducted from September 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, among 172 adult patients in 6 Spanish hospitals who received CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory LBCL and survived at least 3 months after infusion, without subsequent antilymphoma therapy. Treatment with tisagenlecleucel or axicabtagene ciloleucel. Data on any late AEs occurring in this patient population were collected until the patients received new antilymphoma therapy, were lost to follow-up, died, or reached 24 months after infusion, whichever occurred first. Data collection for each patient started at the third month after infusion and included new-onset AEs, as well as persistent AEs that started earlier but were still ongoing at that time point. The study enrolled 172 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [13.7] years; 101 men [58.7%]), of whom 135 (78.5%) experienced at least 1 late AE of any grade. Infections were the late AEs with the highest incidence (5.6 per 100 person-months [95% CI, 4.5-7.0 per 100 person-months]), followed by neutropenia (3.6 per 100 person-months [95% CI, 2.9-4.5 per 100 person-months]) and thrombocytopenia (2.2 per 100 person-months [95% CI, 1.7-3.0 per 100 person-months]). The incidence of infectious episodes remained stable during the whole study period, while cytopenias decreased beyond 6 months after infusion. All cases of nonrelapse-related mortality were due to infections (COVID-19 pneumonia in 3 patients and sepsis or bacterial pneumonia in 4 patients). Twenty-three patients (13.4%) experienced 27 dermatologic AEs, all mild, with most of them (88.9% [24 of 27]) starting beyond 3 months after infusion. Fifteen neurologic AEs were reported in 15 patients (8.7%), and 10 patients (5.8%) developed 13 cardiovascular AEs. Five secondary neoplasms were reported in 4 patients (2.3%), with no cases of T-cell malignant neoplasms. This cohort study suggests that CAR T-cell therapy has a favorable safety profile. However, continuous follow-up of patients is needed, as serious AEs can occur years after infusion.",

    "abstract": "Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) is a highly malignant tumor type in the head and neck region. In recent years, neoadjuvant therapy has significantly improved the laryngeal preservation rate among patients. However, there are variations in the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy, and the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for its efficacy remains a challenging research focus. This study aims to explore the correlation between the expression of P53, P16, and Ki67 and the response to neoadjuvant therapy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2021 to June 2024. Patients were grouped based on their treatment response and the type of neoadjuvant therapy received. Group analysis were employed to assess the predictive value of P53, P16, and Ki67 for treatment efficacy across different neoadjuvant therapy groups. A total of 120 patients were included in the study, with 60 patients each in the good response and poor response groups. The study comprised three neoadjuvant therapy groups: neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy, and neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Each group had 20 patients with good and poor responses, respectively. Among patients with P53 positivity, the effective rate after neoadjuvant therapy was 35.94%, significantly lower than the 66.07% observed in P53negative patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0017). For P16 positivity, the effective rate was 28.57%, lower than the 52.83% in P16negative patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0880). For patients with Ki67\u2009<\u200960%, the effective rate was 33.33%, significantly lower than the 66.67% in those with Ki67\u2009\u2265\u200960% (p\u2009=\u20090.0005). Comprehensively evaluate confirmed that P53 positivity and Ki67\u2009<\u200960% were associated with poor response to neoadjuvant therapy, while P53 negativity and Ki67\u2009\u2265\u200960% were associated with good response. Our findings suggest that the combination of P53\u00a0and P16 can be used as a preliminary tool to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HSCC. Specifically, patients with P53 positivity and Ki67\u2009<\u200960% tend to have lower sensitivity to neoadjuvant therapy. Further research may be needed to clarify the precise role of P16 in HSCC.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in immunotherapy and angiogenesis-targeted therapies have transformed the upfront treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, long-term prognoses for patients with unresectable and metastatic disease often remain limited, with the majority experiencing progression after exposure to front-line therapy. In most cases of relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease after prior exposure to an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), there is no role for ICI-rechallenge. Therefore, treatment of R/R RCC relies on the appropriate selection of therapies targeting growth pathways dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This review article summarizes the current landscape of targeted therapies for use in second-line or later-line settings for the treatment of clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. Novel therapeutic strategies currently in development are also discussed. The treatment of R/R RCC primarily consists of inhibition of VEGF, HIF, and mTOR pathways, and the selection of a specific agent depends on the histologic subtype of the tumor, the prior lines of therapy chosen, and patient co-morbidities. Future tumor-based and circulating biomarker research might one day enable the identification of transcriptional signatures that could predict a response to immune, angiogenesis, or HIF-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells grow and survive in the tumor microenvironment, which is a complicated process. As a key part of how colorectal cancer (CRC) progresses, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit a double role. Through angiogenesis, this TAM can promote the growth of cancers. Although being able to modify and adjust immune cells is a great advantage, these cells can also exhibit anti-cancer properties including direct killing of cancer cells, presenting antigens, and aiding T cell-mediated responses. The delicate regulatory mechanisms between the immune system and tumors are composed of a complex network of pathways regulated by several factors including hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, cytokine/chemokine signaling, and cell interactions. Decoding and figuring out these complex systems become significant in building targeted treatment programs. Targeting TAMs in CRC involves disrupting chemokine signaling or adhesion molecules, reprogramming them to an anti-tumor phenotype using TLR agonists, CD40 agonists, or metabolic modulation, and selectively removing TAM subsets that promote tumor growth. Multi-drug resistance, the absence of an accurate biomarker, and drug non-specificity are also major problems. Combining macrophage-targeted therapies with chemotherapy and immunotherapy may revolutionize treatment. Macrophage studies will advance with new technology and multi-omics methodologies to help us understand CRC and build specific and efficient treatments.",

Improving drug targeting, blocking immune checkpoints, and promoting the activation of immune cells are crucial for reprogramming the TIM. Here, an intercellular adhesion molecule 1-targeted antibody\u2012drug conjugate in combination with a B7-H3-CD3 bispecific antibody is selected for TIM reprogramming, which improved the efficacy of triple-negative breast cancer immunotherapy. This combination therapy improves drug targeting, blocks immune checkpoint pathways, and activates effector T cells to release cytokines, leading to immunogenic cell death and the release of tumor-associated antigens. This effect promotes the maturation of dendritic cells, infiltration and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, repolarization of M1-type macrophages, and reduction of M2-type macrophages, immune suppressor Tregs, and MDS cells, thereby reprogramming the TIM. In addition, this innovative strategy promotes the accumulation of immune cells at metastasis sites and significantly impedes the progression of lung metastatic lesions. Overall, this study provides novel insights for reprogramming the TIM using novel immunotherapeutic strategies that leverage the synergistic effects of antibody-drug conjugates\u00a0and bispecific antibodies.",

These cells present a compelling alternative that warrants a comprehensive evaluation of their therapeutic potential and safety profile. This study employed a MSLN/CD3 bispecific antibody to compare the anti-tumor activity of NKT and \u03b3\u03b4T cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as controls, both ",

This study aims to delineate the predictive significance of disulfidoptosis-related genes (DRGs) in LUAD, their potential as therapeutic targets, and their interaction with the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the expression profiles of 23 DRGs and survival data, performing consensus clustering to identify molecular subtypes. Survival analysis and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to explore cluster differences. Key DRGs were selected for Cox and LASSO regression to develop a prognostic model. Tensin4 (TNS4), a key gene in the model, was further evaluated through immunohistochemistry (IHC) in LUAD and normal tissues and gene knockdown experiments  Two clusters were identified, with 225 differentially expressed genes. A six-gene signature was developed, which classified LUAD patients into high- and low-risk groups, showing significant survival differences. The risk score independently predicted LUAD prognosis and correlated with immunotherapy responses. IHC showed elevated TNS4 levels in LUAD tissues, while  This study highlights the role of DRGs in LUAD, with a validated gene signature offering new avenues for targeted therapies, potentially improving LUAD treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the understanding of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biology and tumor progression mechanisms, resulting in the development of novel strategies for early detection and wide-ranging care approaches. Since their introduction, over 20 years ago, targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for NSCLC. Nowadays, targeted therapies remain the gold standard for many patients, but still they suffer from many adverse effects, including unexpected toxicity and intrinsic acquired resistance mutations, which lead to relapse. The adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 2015, has offered exceptional survival benefits for patients without targetable alterations. Despite this notable progress, challenges remain, as not all patients respond favorably to ICIs, and resistance to therapy can develop over time. A crucial factor influencing clinical response to immunotherapy is the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is pivotal in orchestrating the interactions between neoplastic cells and the immune system, influencing tumor growth and treatment outcomes. In this review, we discuss how the understanding of this intricate relationship is crucial for the success of immunotherapy and survey the current state of immunotherapy intervention, with a focus on forthcoming and promising chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies in NSCLC. The TME sets major obstacles for CAR-T therapies, creating conditions that suppress the immune response, inducing T cell exhaustion. To enhance treatment efficacy, specific efforts associated with CAR-T cell therapy in NSCLC, should definitely focus TME-related immunosuppression and antigen escape mechanisms, by combining CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint blockades.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a unique \"cold\" immune profile. DNA damage repair (DDR) genes are closely related to tumorigenesis and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in many tumors. However, the role and mechanism of DDR in the genesis and progression of EGFRm NSCLC remain unclear. This study included 101 EGFRm NSCLC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and a GSE31210 dataset (external set) from the GEO database. Cluster analysis was used to identify different subtypes of EGFRm NSCLC based on the expression of DDR genes. Univariate and LASSO regression analysis was used to develop a DDR-based predictive model. The prognostic significance of this model was assessed using Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and immune profiles associated with this model. In\u00a0vitro experiment was performed to testify the role of DDR genes in EGFRm NSCLC. We identified two subtypes of EGFRm NSCLC: DDR-activated and DDR-suppressed. The DDR-activated subtype showed more aggressive clinical behavior and poorer prognosis and was more responsive to immunotherapy. A prognostic model for EGFRm NSCLC was constructed using four DDR genes: CAPS, FAM83A, IGLV8-61, and SLC7A5. The derived risk score could serve as an independent prognostic indicator. High- and low-risk patients exhibited distinct clinicopathological characteristics, immune profiles, and responses to immunotherapy. The T-cell inflammation and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) scores differed between the high- and low-risk subgroups, with both showing enhanced effectiveness of immunotherapy in the low-risk subgroup. Targeted therapy such as BI.2536, an inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1, could be effective for patients with high-risk EGFRm NSCLC. Meanwhile, in\u00a0vitro detection approved the role of DDR genes in EGFRm NSCLC response. This study demonstrated a diversity of DDR genes in EGFRm NSCLC and developed a predictive model using these genes. This model could assist in identifying potential candidates for immunotherapy and in assessing personalized treatment and prognosis of patients with EGFRm NSCLC.",

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of SMARCAL1 using TCGA, GTEx, and CCLE databases, evaluating its expression, genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and their clinical correlations across 33 cancer types. Our findings indicate that SMARCAL1 is overexpressed in several cancers, such as Glioma, LUAD, KIRC, and LIHC, impacting prognosis. Elevated SMARCAL1 is linked to poor outcomes in Glioma, LUAD, and LIHC but correlates with better survival in KIRC. We also found significant associations between SMARCAL1 expression and DNA methylation in 13 cancers. Furthermore, SMARCAL1 expression correlates with immune infiltration, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.

This study presents a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the CRC tumor microenvironment (TME), integrating transcriptomic data from 388,511\u00a0cells across 98 samples from 63 patients. Employing advanced computational methods, we stratified patients based on their immune cell infiltration profiles, revealing distinct immunophenotypes with potential therapeutic implications. Our analysis focused on tissue-resident neutrophils (TRNs) and uncovered previously uncharacterized subpopulations with diverse functional states. Trajectory inference analysis revealed a dynamic differentiation path from normal-associated neutrophils to tumor-associated neutrophils, highlighting the remarkable plasticity of these cells within the tumor environment. By integrating single-cell data with bulk transcriptomic and clinical information, we identified specific neutrophil-derived gene signatures associated with poor prognosis in CRC, suggesting their potential as novel prognostic biomarkers. This study not only provides unprecedented insights into neutrophil heterogeneity in CRC but also identifies potential targets for immunomodulatory therapies.

We aimed to develop a new prognostic model associated with PCRGs that can be used for prognosis and immunotherapy prediction in HCC patients. The transcriptional profiles and clinical data related to HCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Differentially expressed PCRGs were identified using the \"edgeR\" package. Prognostic model associated with PCRGs were constructed using univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate regression analysis. The prognostic value of the model was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, the tumor immune microenvironment was assessed using single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and the CIBERSORT algorithm. Finally, potential drugs targeting signature genes were predicted. We successfully constructed a prognostic signature based on PCRGs, and the prognostic results were superior in the low-risk group. The nomogram demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance in estimating overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. The results of immune cell infiltration and predictions of immunotherapy response revealed that the low-risk group exhibited a more favorable response to immunotherapy. In addition, signature gene expression was significantly correlated with antitumor drug sensitivity. In conclusion, the characteristics of PCRGs serve as valuable tools for accurately assessing the prognosis and tumor microenvironment of HCC patients. Additionally, PCRGs markers can facilitate precision therapy in HCC management.",

Recent advancements have highlighted the crucial role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in GBM's molecular biology. Unlike protein-coding RNAs, lncRNAs regulate gene expression through transcription, post-transcriptional modifications, and chromatin remodeling. Some lncRNAs, like HOTAIR, CCAT2, CRNDE, and MALAT1, promote GBM development by affecting tumor suppressors and various signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, mTOR, EGFR, NF-\u03baB, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin. Conversely, certain lncRNAs such as TUG1, MEG3, and GAS8-AS1 act as tumor suppressors and are associated with better prognosis. The study presented in the manuscript aims to explore the involvement of lncRNAs in GBM, focusing on their roles in tumor progression, proliferation, invasion, and potential implications for early detection and immunotherapy.

However, the primary breast cancer HRD positivity rate is merely 24%. The identification of markers associated with HRD is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for breast cancer. The role of the oncogene ERCC6L in breast cancer remains unclear, and its interaction with radiotherapy has yet to be explored, necessitating further investigation for clarification. We employed WGCNA to identify genes associated with the HRD score, utilizing public HRD score and genetic data from TCGA breast cancer, with their clinical characteristics. Subsequently, we employed various machine learning methods to filter relevant genes. The final four genes were obtained through random forest and stepCox, and their performance was validated in TCGA, GSE96058, and METABRIC datasets. Next, we assessed the tumor immune microenvironment using methods such as ssGSEA, GSVA, CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and single-cell analysis. Finally, we validated the downregulation of ERCC6L, increasing DNA damage and enhancing radiation sensitivity, through immune fluorescence, flow cytometry, plate cloning, and western blot. A prognostic model named HRAS was established through machine learning, consisting of four genes (ERCC6L, UBE2T, TPX2, and SLC7A5). The indicator exhibited excellent predictive performance on the prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy and radiotherapy of breast cancer patients in independent datasets. Breast cancer patients with high HRAS scores showed higher TMB and stemness, increased expression of immune checkpoints, reduced immune cell infiltration, and poorer prognosis in the context of immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Experimental validation demonstrated that knockdown of ERCC6L markedly elevated DNA damage, enhanced apoptosis, and induced cell cycle arrest in response to radiation therapy, thereby sensitizing cells to radiation. The HRD-related signatures displayed strong predictive capabilities for the prognosis in multiple datasets and the efficacy of immunotherapy and radiotherapy of breast cancer patients. Moreover, the composite indicator reflected the immune microenvironment characteristics and could be novel markers for predicting the prognosis and clinical treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients. Our experiments first elucidated the role of ERCC6L in enhancing radiation-induced DNA damage, presenting a novel target for strategies aimed at sensitizing cancer cells to radiotherapy.",

Immune infiltration was evaluated using the Cibersortx algorithm, and drug response prediction was performed using the pRRophetic package. TAF10 functional investigations in LUAD cells involved bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and assays for cell proliferation. Seven distinct cell clusters were identified by CytoTRACE, with epithelial cell cluster 1 (Epi_C1) showing the highest stemness potential. The TSCMS model included 49 tumor stemness-related genes; high-risk patients exhibited lower immune and ESTIMATE scores and increased tumor purity. Significant differences in immune landscapes and chemotherapy sensitivity were observed between risk groups. TAF10 positively correlated with RNA expression-based stemness scores in various tumors, including LUAD. It was over-expressed in LUAD cell lines and clinical tumor tissues, with high expression linked to poor prognosis. Silencing TAF10 inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation. This study demonstrates the TSCMS model's prognostic value in LUAD, reveals insights into immune infiltration and therapeutic response, and identifies TAF10 as a potential therapeutic target.",

As an emerging epigenetic modification, lactylation has a significant impact on the metabolic pathways of tumor cells, immune evasion, gene expression regulation, and sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Studies have shown that lactylation modification significantly alters the development and therapeutic response of tumors by affecting metabolites in the TME, immune cell functions, and signaling pathways. In the field of immunotherapy, the regulatory role of lactylation modification provides a new perspective and potential targets for tumor treatment, including modulating the sensitivity of tumors to immunotherapy by affecting the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and the infiltration of immune cells. Moreover, research progress on lactylation modification in various types of tumors indicates that it may serve as a biomarker to predict patients' responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Overall, research on lactylation modification provides a theoretical foundation for the development of new tumor treatment strategies and holds promise for improving patient prognosis and quality of life.

CD47 blockade is a novel immunotherapy aiming to activate macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells, but it is currently unknown if the tumor-associated macrophages expressing CD163 respond poorly to CD47 blockade. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were exposed to tumor-conditioned medium from A2780 ovarian cancer cells during differentiation. Effects on gene expression, membrane protein levels, release of soluble proteins and macrophage phagocytosis of A2780 cells in response to CD47 blockade were measured and compared to control macrophages. Tumor cell conditioning induced macrophage expression of CD163 on both the mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, tumor conditioning simultaneously increased protein expression of the phenotype markers CD206 and CD80, and the phagocytosis checkpoint LILRB1. However, tumor conditioning did not reduce phagocytic capacity, as CD47 blockade induced macrophage phagocytosis of A2780 cells to similar degrees in both control and tumor cell-conditioned macrophages. In vitro tumor conditioning did not reduce the phagocytic response to CD47 blockade, suggesting that induction of a macrophage phenotype with increased expression of CD163 does not directly limit the capacity for phagocytosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CD163+ macrophages remain responsive to CD47 blockade, highlighting their potential as targets for immunotherapy in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) are a wide class of malignancies with dismal prognosis. The therapeutic scenario of metastatic BTCs has profoundly changed during recent years. The combination of cisplatin-gemcitabine plus immunotherapy is currently the gold standard in the first line. The more extensive comprehension of the mechanisms at the basis of BTCs and the identification of several molecular alterations has led to the introduction of target-directed therapies in the second line and beyond that have expanded the therapeutic armamentarium alongside the standard FOLFOX regimen, and for the near future, the results of some trials with targeted therapies in first line are expected. HER2 represents a promising therapeutic target detected in BTCs, being overexpressed in approximately 15-20% of cases, with a strong predilection for gallbladder carcinoma and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, although a small proportion of HER2 overexpression can be detected even in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The efficacy and safety of different HER2 inhibitors have been investigated in several studies in the second line and beyond with encouraging results. This comprehensive review is intended to provide a summary of existing evidence and future perspectives on HER2 altered BTCs.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between T cells, particularly na\u00efve CD4 T cells (CD4Tn), and colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly complex. CD4Tn play a crucial role in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment, yet the precise mechanisms by which they influence tumor progression remain elusive. This study aims to explore the relationship between CRC and CD4Tn, identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and focus on the role of CD4Tn in shaping the immune environment of CRC. Single-cell transcriptomics, alongside the scPagwas algorithm, were employed to identify pivotal T cell subsets involved in CRC progression. Bulk transcriptomic data were further analyzed using deconvolution algorithms to elucidate the roles of these key T cell subsets. The abundance of na\u00efve CD4 T cells (CD4Tn) was specifically assessed to gauge patient responses to immunotherapy, alterations in the immune microenvironment, and correlations with genetic mutations. Key genes linked to CD4Tn were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and Pearson correlation scores. The SMR algorithm was subsequently used for validation, with experimental verification following. Through single-cell transcriptomics and the scPagwas algorithm, CD4Tn was confirmed as a critical cell type in CRC progression. High infiltration of CD4Tn cells in CRC patients was correlated with poorer prognosis and suboptimal responses to immunotherapy. SMR analysis suggested a potential causal link between DRAM2 gene expression and CRC progression. Experimental knockdown of DRAM2 in colorectal cancer cells significantly inhibited tumor growth. The DRAM2 gene, associated with CD4Tn cells, appears to play a pivotal role in the advancement of CRC and may represent a promising therapeutic target for treatment.",

In this study, a total of 244 genes were correlated with CAF infiltration, with 11 linked to overall survival. Notably, FSTL3, CRIP2, and SLC2A3 were selected for the CAFscore. A higher CAFscore was associated with poorer prognoses, increased malignancy, and therapeutic resistance, particularly among patients with high tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability. Furthermore, elevated FSTL3 expression was associated with reduced CD8",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have high incidence rates and mortality rates. Anoikis is a special type of cell apoptosis, and anoikis resistance has been reported to be associated with tumor malignancy. We aimed to explore the roles of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in the GI cancer prognosis. We extracted RNA sequencing and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibu databases for patients with esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer and rectal cancer and identified ARGs from GeneCards and Harmonizome. Anoikis-related patterns were identified via unsupervised clustering analysis. We constructed a prognostic signature (Anoscore) based on prognostic ARGs through univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The model was validated and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves, univariate Cox regression analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis, column charts, and calibration curves. We also performed a single-cell sequencing analysis of candidate genes via TISCH2. A correlation analysis between the Anoscore, the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity was conducted in GI cancers. The expression and function of some candidate genes were validated  In terms of prognostic ARGs, two anoikis-related patterns, ARG clusters A and B, were identified. ARG cluster B had a worse prognosis than did ARG cluster A. Subsequently, the Anoscore was developed as an independent prognostic factor. It demonstrated the robust predictive capability for the prognosis of patients with GI cancers. Notably, patients with high Anoscores exhibited poor outcomes. In addition, we established a nomogram (Ano-nomogram) based on the Anoscore and clinicopathological factors of patients to predict the 3-year and 5-year survival probabilities. Moreover, patients with high Anoscores had higher levels of immune cell infiltration and higher immune checkpoint expression. The drug sensitivity analysis revealed that patients with high or low Anoscores were sensitive to different chemotherapies and targeted drugs. S100A11 and TLR3, representative candidate genes, exhibited different expression patterns and biological functions. This study highlighted the significant potential of the Anoscore in predicting prognosis and guiding the selection of personalized therapeutic regimens for patients with GI cancers.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignant cancers worldwide. Although immunotherapy has improved the treatment outcome in HCC, a significant percentage of patients with advanced HCC still cannot benefit from immunotherapy. Therefore, developing new targets or combination therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy is urgently needed. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying immune regulation may help in this regard. The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a diverse set of components modulating the efficacy of immunotherapy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the TME and can regulate both tumor and immune cells through secreted cytokines and exosomes that impact various signaling pathways in target cells. CAF-derived cytokines can also participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, thereby impacting cancer progression and tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy among other effects. A thorough understanding of the phenotypic and functional profile dynamism of CAFs may lead the way for new treatment strategies and/or better treatment outcomes in HCC patients. In this review, we outline the biomarkers and functional heterogeneity of CAFs in HCC and elaborate on molecular mechanisms of CAFs, including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. We also examine current clinical implications of CAFs-related targets as potential therapeutic candidates in HCC.",

Here we present the safety, efficacy, and biomarker results of the first-in-human phase I/Ib study of intratumoral E7766 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Eligible patients with relapsing/refractory cancers (n=24) were enrolled in dose-escalating cohorts to receive intratumoral injections of E7766 from 75 to 1000\u2009\u00b5g. The most frequent treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were chills (50.0%; 85.7%), fever (40.0%; 85.7%), and fatigue (30.0%; 35.7%) in patients who received non-visceral and visceral injections, respectively. Eight patients (33.3%) achieved stable disease as their best response per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 with variability between injected and non-injected lesions. Plasma levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IP-10, MCP1, and MIP1b transiently increased in all evaluable patients within 10 hours postinjection, then dropped to baseline levels. Levels of blood and tumor gene expression increased in most interferon-related and STING genes tested. Further increases in programmed death ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 8 expression at both the RNA and protein levels were also observed in some patients across dose levels. In total, E7766 generated on-target pharmacodynamic effects in patients with solid tumors. Further exploration in a homogeneous patient population is necessary to assess efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely used in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. Immune checkpoints are a type of molecules that play an important role in the self-regulation of the immune system. In tumor immunity, their activation by immune checkpoints leads to the inhibition of effector lymphocyte activation or the mediation of cytotoxic T cell dysfunction, resulting in immune escape. These immune checkpoints include programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and others. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block the interaction between immune checkpoint receptors and ligands, thereby relieving the immune suppression caused by immune checkpoints, and reactivating immune cells to exert antitumor effects. With the continuous progress of immunotherapy research, drugs targeting PDL-1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 have played an important role in clinical treatment. However, some patients still cannot benefit from immunotherapy; therefore, multitarget immunotherapy is an important way to improve the response rate of immunotherapy. CD96 is one of the members of the immunoglobulin superfamily receptors, which mainly functions by regulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and is expected to become a new generation of immune checkpoints. This article reviews the molecular structure of CD96, its role in tumor immunity, and its application in hepatocellular carcinoma, hoping to provide reference for related research.",

Despite promising advancements in models that amalgamate molecular subtypes with treatment and prognostic outcomes, the considerable heterogeneity in BLCA poses challenges to their universal applicability. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a new molecular subtyping system focusing on a critical clinical feature of BLCA: senescence. Utilizing unsupervised clustering on the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)-BLCA cohort, we crafted a senescence-associated molecular classification and precision quantification system (Senescore). This method underwent systematic validation against established molecular subtypes, treatment strategies, clinical outcomes, the immune tumor microenvironment (TME), relevance to immune checkpoints, and identification of potential therapeutic targets. External validations were conducted using the Xiangya cohort, IMvigor210 cohort, and meta-cohort, with multiplex immunofluorescence confirming the correlation between Senescore, immune infiltration, and cellular senescence. Notably, patients categorized within higher Senescore group were predisposed to the basal subtype, showcased augmented immune infiltration, harbored elevated driver gene mutations, and exhibited increased senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors expression in the transcriptome. Despite poorer prognoses, these patients revealed greater responsiveness to immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our molecular subtyping and Senescore, informed by age-related clinical features, accurately depict age-associated biological traits and its clinical application potential in BLCA. Moreover, this personalized assessment framework is poised to identify senolysis targets unique to BLCA, furthering the integration of aging research into therapeutic strategies.",

Through comprehensive preclinical studies, we established a foundational understanding of the synergistic benefits of combining I-DXd treatment with PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition, thereby opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in advanced cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare type of cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. In recent years, there have been notable advancements in the treatment of ES due to the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy, as well as a wealth of related studies in this field published by scholars around the world. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive report to aid researchers in quickly understanding the knowledge structure and emerging trends of this area. We conducted a comprehensive search in the Web of Science Core Collection for relevant studies published from 2000 to 2023. To conduct a thorough scientometric analysis and create network visualizations, we utilized three different tools, namely, an online analysis platform, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer. These tools enabled us to examine various aspects such as annual publication output; active journals; contributions from countries, institutions, and authors; references; and keywords. A total of 5163 qualified publications were included. The annual number of publications on ES showed a significant linear growth trend (R ES is a field that has continued to receive increasing attention in recent years. Harnessing current immunotherapy approaches to improve outcomes of patients with ES is an area of intense interest. This study has provided a comprehensive knowledge map, development landscape, and future directions for ES research, and offered a practical and valuable reference for scholars to obtain better understanding of the current state of research in this field.",

    "abstract": "The role of the human microbiome in cancer has been extensively studied, focusing mainly on bacteria-host interactions and their impact on tumor development and treatment response. However, fungi, an immune-active component of the human microbiome, have received less attention regarding their roles in cancer. Recent studies have identified the widespread and specific colonization and distribution of fungi in multiple sites in patients across various cancer types. Importantly, host-fungal immune interactions significantly influence immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. The rapid advancement of immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based cancer immunotherapy creates an urgent need for effective biomarkers and synergistic therapeutic targets. Cancer-associated fungi and their associated antifungal immunity demonstrate significant potential and efficacy in enhancing cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes and discusses the growing evidence of the functions and mechanisms of commensal and pathogenic cancer-associated fungi in cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, we emphasize the potential of fungi as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Copper in melanoma: At the crossroad of protumorigenic and anticancer roles.",
    "abstract": "Copper is an essential micronutrient that is a cofactor for various enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes. Melanoma patients have high serum copper levels, and elevated copper concentrations are found in melanoma tumors. Copper influences the activity of several melanoma-related proteins involved in cell survival, proliferation, pigmentation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Targeting these processes with copper chelators has shown efficacy in reducing tumor growth and overcoming drug resistance. In contrast, excessive copper can also have detrimental effects when imported into melanoma cells. Multiple distinct cellular effects of copper overload, including the induction of different types of cell death, have been reported. Cuproptosis, a novel type of copper-dependent cell death, has been recently described and is associated with the metabolic phenotype. Melanoma cells can switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which are crucial for tumor growth and drug resistance. In this respect, metabolic plasticity might be exploited for the use of copper-delivery strategies, including repurposing of disulfiram, which is approved for the treatment of noncancer patients. In addition, the development of nanomedicines can improve the targeted delivery of copper to melanoma cells and enable the use of these drugs alone or in combination as copper has been shown to complement targeted therapy and immunotherapy in melanoma cells. However, further research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms of both copper restriction and excess copper-induced processes and determine effective biomarkers for predicting treatment sensitivity in melanoma patients. In this review, we discuss the dual role of copper in melanoma biology.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who develop brain metastases face a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have emerged as a promising immunotherapy for treating lung cancer with brain metastases.\u00a0This systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline and evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in treating lung cancer patients with brain metastases. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies up to 27 August 2023. Data on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, radiological response rates, and adverse events were extracted. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.17.\u00a0Our literature search yielded 39 eligible studies involving 15,428 patients. The overall response rate for PD-1 inhibitors was substantial, with pooled rates of 39% for overall response, 7% for complete response (CR), 27% for partial response (PR), and 31% for stable disease (SD). The pooled 6-month OS rate was 77%, and the 1-year OS rate was 61%. Subgroup analyses revealed higher PD-L1 expression levels and the use of platinum-based chemotherapy alongside immunotherapy were associated with improved outcomes.\u00a0PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in treating lung cancer patients with brain metastases, as evidenced by significant improvements in OS, PFS, and response rates. Incorporating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors into the treatment regimen, particularly for patients with high PD-L1 expression, has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy combined with checkpoint blockade antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein (PD-1) has achieved remarkable success in non-small cell lung cancer. However, few patients benefit from long-term treatment. Therefore, biomarkers capable of guiding the optimal therapeutic selection and reducing unnecessary toxicity are of pressing importance. In our research, we gathered serial blood samples from two groups of non-small cell lung cancer patients: 49 patients received a combination of therapies, and 34 patients went under chemotherapy alone. Utilizing non-targeted metabolomic analysis, we examined different metabolites' disparity. Among the lot, L-phenylalanine emerged as a significant prognostic marker in the combination treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients, interestingly absent in patients under sole chemotherapy. The reduced ratio of L-phenylalanine concentration (two-cycle treatment vs. pre-treatment) was associated with improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.8000, 95% confidence interval: 0.8566\u20123.7820, ",

The risk of secondary malignancies, especially myeloid neoplasms, is of particular concern in the CAR T therapy. A patient with R/R follicular lymphoma was diagnosed with secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (s-MDS) after CD19 CAR T therapy. We also provided a review of recently published literature concerning the risk of secondary myeloid neoplasms (SMN) following CAR T therapy. The patient had secondary MDS after CD19 CAR T therapy. She received active treatment for nearly one year and then she died. The case illustrated the onset and progression of SMN after CD19 CAR T therapy in patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma and provides useful information of this uncommon later event.",

Traditional approaches to clinical trial safety evaluation have limitations in their ability to detect signals of cardiovascular risk. Mechanisms to increase power and specificity to clarify cardiovascular safety are required. However, implications include increased costs and slower development. The Cardiovascular Safety Research Consortium facilitated stakeholder discussions with representation from academia, industry, and regulators. A think tank was assembled with the aim of providing recommendations for improved collection and reporting of cardiovascular safety signals in oncology trials. Two working groups were formed. The first focuses on incorporation of consensus definitions of cardiovascular disease into the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events used in oncology trial reporting. The second group considers methods for ascertainment and adjudication of cardiovascular events in cancer trials. The overarching aim of this primer is to improve understanding of the potential cardiovascular toxicities of cancer therapies.",
