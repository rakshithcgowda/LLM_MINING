    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib, which target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), show considerable therapeutic effectiveness in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations. Nevertheless, the resistance that develops against EGFR-TKIs diminishes their therapeutic impact in clinical settings. This investigation focused on the impact of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) on gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. Using the CCK-8 assay, the influence of different gefitinib concentrations on cell proliferation was examined. eIF4E and EGFR expressions were verified by qRT-PCR and/or western blotting in NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, the effects of eIF4E knockdown in gefitinib-treated PC9/GR cells were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry, colony formation assays, and xenograft tumor model. eIF4E expression was remarkably upregulated in the gefitinib-resistant PC9/GR cells. Moreover, the expression levels of eIF4E in NSCLC cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent increase following gefitinib administration. The function assays demonstrated that reducing eIF4E levels hindered the proliferation of PC9/GR cells and enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effects of gefitinib both in vitro and in vivo, and also had an inhibitory action on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that eIF4E confers gefitinib resistance in NSCLC by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Therefore, eIF4E is a possible therapeutic target for improving therapeutic action in NSCLC patients who have developed resistance to gefitinib.",

    "abstract": "Precision oncology has transformed the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by tailoring treatment to the specific genetic alterations driving oncogenesis. Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have been shown to dramatically improve survival in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. However, treatment options remain limited for patients with early or locally advanced stage (I-III) NSCLC harboring driver mutations, when the disease is not resectable, or the patient is unsuitable for surgery due to poor fitness or comorbidities. There is growing interest in combining targeted therapies with radiotherapy to optimise treatment outcomes for this patient group. Notably, a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit has recently been reported with the third-generation TKI osimertinib in patients with inoperable, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated, stage III NSCLC following chemoradiotherapy. A narrative review of the literature was performed using PubMed, OVID(EMBASE) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies evaluating the combination of targeted therapies and radiotherapy in inoperable stage I-III NSCLC. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the incidence of actionable driver alterations and emerging clinical evidence on combining targeted therapies with thoracic radiotherapy in patients with inoperable, stage I-III NSCLC. The toxicity profile of combination treatments, optimal sequencing strategies, ongoing clinical trials and future perspectives in this field are highlighted. A clear biological rationale supports the synergistic effects of combining targeted therapies with radiotherapy in the neo-adjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant settings. Advanced clinical trial methodologies may facilitate further research in this area, particularly for rare genetic alterations, to improve outcomes for these patients.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have seen the development of targeted therapeutics against the RTK/RAS/MAPK pathway which, when aberrantly activated, drives malignant transformation of many cancer indications. However, efficacy of inhibitors targeting single molecules is dampened by pathway feedback activation and acquired drug resistance. We seek to evaluate the application of JAB-3312 (Sitneprotafib), a potent inhibitor of SHP2, in the RTK/RAS/MAPK pathway-targeted combination therapies. Furthermore, SHP2 plays a vital role in PD-1-mediated immunosuppression. Rational combination of JAB-3312 with PD-1 blocking therapies is also explored. Biochemical and cellular assays were applied to evaluate the potency of JAB-3312 in SHP2 inhibition. Tumor cell lines, cell line- and patient-derived xenografts were used to test different combinations of JAB-3312 with KRASG12C, MEK, EGFR, and PD-1 inhibitors. JAB-3312 produced potent in vitro inhibition of SHP2 activity and downstream ERK phosphorylation, with IC50s of 1.44 nM and 0.68 to 4.84 nM, respectively. When in combination, JAB-3312 significantly increased the anti-tumor activity of KRASG12C inhibitor glecirasib in na\u00efve and resistant models. Combination of JAB-3312 with MEK inhibitors significantly delayed RTK signaling reactivation and enhanced tumor growth inhibition in KRAS-mutated cancer models. JAB-3312-osimertinib combination exhibited great efficacy in osimertinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer models. Besides, JAB-3312 enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapies by promoting anti-tumor microenvironment. Representative cases of patients with response to the combination therapies from two ongoing clinical trials (NCT05288205, NCT04720976) were reported. JAB-3312 in combination with RTK/RAS/MAPK or PD-1 blockage therapies is a promising strategy that warrants further clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "This case report describes a rare and severe instance of osimertinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation during postoperative adjuvant therapy following lung cancer resection. This is the most severe reported case, necessitating intensive care. While severe ILD during adjuvant therapy is uncommon, its incidence may increase as osimertinib use expands. A 68-year-old nonsmoking female with no history of ILD underwent left lower lobectomy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIB, pT3N0M0). Following adjuvant cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy, osimertinib (80 mg/day) was initiated. Thirty-five days later, she developed acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia [saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO2) 78% on room air], rendering her unable to walk without assistance. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities across both lungs. Osimertinib was discontinued, and methylprednisolone (500 mg/day) was started; however, oxygenation rapidly deteriorated, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation the following day. The patient was diagnosed with severe grade IV ILD induced by osimertinib. After 5 days of methylprednisolone, treatment was switched to prednisolone (60 mg/day), but oxygenation worsened, and pulmonary infiltrates reappeared on CT. Methylprednisolone (500 mg/day) was reintroduced for 5 days. The partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio then improved, and prednisolone was gradually tapered from 1 mg/kg with a weekly reduction of 10 mg based on clinical and radiologic improvement. The patient was discharged on day 72 with prednisolone 30 mg/day. Although respiratory symptoms improved significantly, she required long-term home oxygen therapy due to residual hypoxemia during exertion. This case underscores the potentially life-threatening nature of osimertinib-induced ILD in adjuvant therapy. Careful patient selection, thorough risk assessment, and vigilant monitoring are crucial for early detection and management. Given the increasing use of osimertinib in postoperative settings, further research is needed to better understand and mitigate the risks associated with this therapy.",

    "abstract": "Lung adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the most common type of lung cancer among non-smokers. Lung adenocarcinoma in exon 19 deletion (E19del) mutation-positive cases respond well to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our case demonstrates the development of resistance to first- and third-generation TKIs in a 48-year-old woman with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. A 48 years old woman with no smoking history and no family history of cancer was diagnosed with EGFR mutation-positive advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular analysis indicated a positive EGFR E19del mutation and a positive T790M mutation, and after two rounds of chemotherapy, the patient was treated with osimertinib for 2 years. However, the patient started to experience recurring chest discomfort, dyspnea, insomnia, and bone pain while being treated. A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan at that time revealed metastasis of the tumor to the paraaortic lymph nodes and lumbar spine. A repeat analysis revealed that the T790M mutation had disappeared while other mutations remained unchanged, and she was switched to erlotinib as per the evidence for the use of erlotinib in osimertinib-resistant lung cancer. The patient developed cutaneous adverse reactions and, although her symptoms subsided initially for 6 months, she developed morning headaches and worsening insomnia. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed metastasis to the frontal and occipital lobes of her brain, indicating failure of erlotinib treatment. Resistance development to TKIs poses a significant challenge to the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive advanced lung adenocarcinoma, owing to the scarce availability of further pharmacological agents post-TKIs. This case illustrates the significance of prompt recognition of resistance to erlotinib and osimertinib and highlights the importance of further research to prevent treatment failure and hence, to deter metastatic progression of the tumor in patients with advanced NSCLC.",

Systemic evaluation confirmed ALK-rearranged NSCLC (case 1) and EGFR-mutated NSCLC (cases 2 and 3), leading to first-line treatment with Alectinib and Osimertinib, respectively. Within months of therapy initiation, significant anatomical and visual improvements were noted, with complete lesion resolution and photoreceptor restoration by 6 months. At final follow-up (24-36 months), high-resolution OCT showed residual granularity in the outer retinal layers, while OCT angiography (OCTA) revealed persistent choriocapillaris flow voids. Microperimetry demonstrated distinct functional alterations based on lesion location.ConclusionsThis series highlights favorable long-term outcomes in NSCLC patients with CMs treated with next-generation TKIs.

    "abstract": "Common EGFR mutations including exon-19 deletions and the L858R point mutation in exon 21 constitute predominant actionable genomic alterations in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for such patients by improving both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Among EGFR-TKIs, third-generation agents such as osimertinib have shown marked efficacy and favorable safety profiles and have become the standard of care in the first-line setting. The combination of osimertinib with platinum-based chemotherapy has recently been shown to improve PFS compared with osimertinib monotherapy in the FLAURA2 trial. Similarly, the MARIPOSA trial demonstrated clinical benefit of the combination of the EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, amivantamab, with the third-generation EGFR-TKI, lazertinib, further supporting the use of combination therapies as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Despite these advances, however, challenges such as brain metastases remain substantial barriers to successful treatment outcomes. Management of patients with such metastases often requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates systemic treatment with local interventions such as radiation therapy. Finally, circulating tumor DNA has emerged as a promising biomarker for real-time monitoring of treatment response and evolution of drug resistance mechanisms. Analysis of such biomarkers can facilitate dynamic and personalized therapeutic adjustments, potentially improving outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest clinical evidence supporting therapeutic advances in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment strategies based on tumor biology, patient-specific factors, and evolving therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "A clinically important subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is driven by common mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Over the past decade, first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have substantially improved clinical outcomes, although acquired resistance inevitably emerges. In particular, the third-generation TKI osimertinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to earlier-generation TKIs in the frontline setting, yet median OS remains approximately three years in pivotal trials. Efforts to extend disease control have led to various upfront intensification strategies, including combining EGFR TKIs with antiangiogenics or chemotherapy (e.g., the FLAURA-2 trial), and pairing novel bispecific antibodies such as amivantamab with third-generation TKIs. Upon progression on third-generation EGFR TKIs, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard second-line treatment, albeit with modest response rates. Emerging therapies targeting MET amplification (e.g., savolitinib plus osimertinib), leveraging antibody-drug conjugates (e.g., patritumab deruxtecan), or adding immunotherapy and antiangiogenics have shown preliminary promise in overcoming resistance. Ongoing trials are assessing optimal treatment sequencing and the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide therapy escalation or de-escalation. Ultimately, the evolving landscape of EGFR-mutant NSCLC underscores the need for refined biomarker-driven approaches and personalized regimens to achieve further gains in survival. In this review, we discuss these strategies in detail, highlighting current evidence and future directions for EGFR-mutant NSCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "APOBEC mutagenesis is one of the most common endogenous sources of mutations in human cancer and is a major source of genetic intratumor heterogeneity. High levels of APOBEC mutagenesis are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease across diverse cancers, but the mechanistic and functional impacts of APOBEC mutagenesis on tumor evolution and therapy resistance remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we investigated the contribution of APOBEC mutagenesis to acquired therapy resistance in a model of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. We find that inhibition of EGFR in lung cancer cells leads to a rapid and pronounced induction of APOBEC3 expression and activity. Functionally, APOBEC expression promotes the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) following EGFR inhibition. Constitutive expression of APOBEC3B alters the evolutionary trajectory of acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, making it more likely that resistance arises through de novo acquisition of the T790M gatekeeper mutation and squamous transdifferentiation during the DTP state. APOBEC3B expression is associated with increased expression of the squamous cell transcription factor deltaNp63 and squamous cell transdifferentiation in gefitinib-resistant cells. Knockout of p63 in gefitinib-resistant cells reduces the expression of the deltaNp63 target genes IL1alpha/beta and sensitizes these cells to the third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. These results suggest that APOBEC activity promotes acquired resistance by facilitating evolution and transdifferentiation in DTPs, and suggest that approaches to target deltaNp63 in gefitinib-resistant lung cancers may have therapeutic benefit.",

We used longitudinal US medical oncology databases to evaluate real-world overall survival (rwOS) prognostic risk factor groups in advanced EGFRm-NSCLC treated with first-line osimertinib. This retrospective, new-user cohort study used electronic records from ConcertAI, Flatiron Clinical-Genomics, and COTA databases. Patients with advanced/metastatic EGFRm-NSCLC initiating osimertinib monotherapy in first-line between April 1, 2018 and October 30, 2022 were included. Follow-up was until death or October 31, 2023. rwOS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors were evaluated using multivariate analysis. 1323 patients were included with median follow-up of 20 months. Median age was 70 years (range 35-89). Median rwOS was 28.6 months (95% CI 26.8-30.9). In high-risk subgroups, median rwOS (months) was 18.1 in patients with ECOG score \u22652, 24.3 with brain metastases, 19.3 with liver metastases, and 25.7 with TP53 co-mutation. 95% of patients had \u22651 high risk factor. Prevalence of ECOG \u22652 was 17%, brain metastases 36%, liver metastases 15%, TP53 co-mutation 63%. Risk of death was significantly higher in patients with high-risk factors (p\u22640.011 for all). In total, 58% of patients survived to 2 years, 18% to 5 years, and 33% did not receive second-line therapy. Despite advances in TKI treatments, long-term survival of patients with advanced EGFRm-NSCLC remains poor.

    "abstract": "The therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib (OSI) in EGFR-mutant lung cancer is ultimately limited by the onset of acquired resistance, of which the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel long non-coding RNA, LRTOR, as a key driver of OSI resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical data indicate that elevated LRTOR expression correlates with poor prognosis in OSI-resistant patients. Functionally, LRTOR promotes tumor growth and confers OSI resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LRTOR shields YAP from LATS-mediated phosphorylation at Ser127 and Ser381, preventing its proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, LRTOR facilitates the interaction between YAP and KCMF1, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination, nuclear translocation of YAP, and formation of the YAP/TEAD1 transcriptional complex, which in turn triggers the transcription of LRTOR, establishing a positive feedback loop that amplifies oncogenic signaling of YAP and consequently induces OSI resistance. LRTOR depletion by siRNA restores OSI sensitivity in resistant tumors, as demonstrated in patient-derived organoid xenograft models.

    "abstract": "EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including osimertinib, have revolutionized EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment; therefore, early identification of EGFR mutations is essential. We report post-hoc analyses of pooled EGFR mutation tissue testing across osimertinib clinical trials, highlighting testing challenges and supporting best practice. Pooled central Cobas\u00ae EGFR Mutation Test data from nine global osimertinib NSCLC clinical trials were analyzed by specimen type, disease stage, and geographical region for specimen adequacy for testing and valid test results. Across 4,864 biopsies and 2,402 resections, 91% were adequate for testing, of which 95% of biopsies and 99% of resections had valid test results. Of biopsies, 12% were inadequate for testing (mainly due to insufficient tumor content [42%] and insufficient tissue volume [35%]) and 3% of resections were inadequate (insufficient tumor content [55%] and incorrect specimen preparation [12%]). Inadequacy varied by disease stage, from 3% in resectable stage IA2-IIIA to 10%-15% in first and second/later-line advanced/metastatic settings, and 16% in unresectable stage III. Test success rates among adequate specimens ranged from 93% (unresectable stage III) to 99% (resectable stage IA2-IIIA). Data were similar by geography. Most tissue specimens were adequate for EGFR testing. Inadequacy was commonly due to insufficient tissue volume or tumor content and higher in biopsies versus resections, and unresectable stage III and first-line advanced/metastatic versus other disease stages. Based on these controlled trial data, pre-analytic variables of tissue specimens are a major driver of testing success; hence maintaining optimal conditions from sample collection to biomarker analysis, as well as improving tissue-sampling techniques is critical to increase testing success rates.

    "abstract": "Perioperative therapy has become a critical component in the management of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in the era of precision medicine. Although molecular testing is standard in metastatic NSCLC, its incorporation into early-stage disease remains essential for guiding treatment decisions. Reflex molecular testing pathways are necessary to optimize tissue utilization and ensure timely results. However, liquid biopsies, although valuable in advanced disease, have limited sensitivity in early-stage NSCLC, reinforcing the need for tissue-based next-generation sequencing. Targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment for oncogene-driven NSCLC, with adjuvant osimertinib now standard for EGFR-mutant disease and ongoing investigations into ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, unanswered questions remain regarding the inclusion of perioperative TKI therapy, the role of molecular residual disease assessment, and whether specific TKIs offer greater benefit for high-risk subgroups. The role of immunotherapy (IO) in oncogene-driven NSCLC remains controversial. Although perioperative chemo-IO has demonstrated survival benefits in unselected NSCLC, its efficacy in EGFR, ALK, and other actionable alterations is unclear. Tumors harboring KRAS and BRAF mutations may respond better because of a more immune-inflamed microenvironment, and remains an active area of investigation. As the landscape of perioperative therapy continues to evolve, ongoing trials will help define the optimal integration of targeted therapies and IO in oncogene-driven NSCLC. Addressing these unanswered questions will be crucial in refining treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 insertions (19ins) represent a unique subclass of exon 19 alterations that has a relatively low frequency. Here, we aimed to elucidate the molecular characteristics and response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in lung cancer patients with EGFR 19ins. Next-generation sequencing was performed to profile the molecular characteristics of 83 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR 19ins. Detailed molecular profiling and efficacy analyses were performed on these patients, with comparisons to 68 EGFR 19 deletion (19del) patients. Potential resistance mechanisms were also explored. The prevalence of EGFR 19ins mutations was 0.17% of all the primary NSCLC patients. EGFR 19ins variants identified were I740_K745dup (86.7%) and K745_E746insVPVAIK (13.3%). Concurrent mutations frequently observed were in TP53 (50.6%), CDKN2A (12.0%), PIK3CA (10.8%), LRP1B (8.4%), and SMAD4 (8.4%). Notably, CTNNB1 was significantly associated with 19ins (p\u2009=\u20090.043). Efficacy analysis showed median progression-free survival (mPFS) for EGFR 19ins patients receiving first-line EGFR-TKI treatment was significantly shorter than for EGFR 19del patients (hazard ratio (HR) 1.98, p\u2009=\u20090.005). Gefitinib was significantly less effective compared to other first-generation TKIs (HR 19.86, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, osimertinib did not generate favorable outcomes as 19dels in the first-line setting either (p\u2009=\u20090.025). Post-treatment samples revealed higher occurrences of TP53 mutations (84.6%) and presence of EGFR T790M (23.1%) at progression, with case studies highlighting osimertinib's limited efficacy post-first-line treatment. Comprehensive analysis of EGFR 19ins in lung cancer patients revealed genomic characteristics and clinical response, helping better inform clinical action and might facilitate the development of more precise therapeutic options for patients with these uncommon driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations is higher among Asian patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer than the general advanced non-small cell lung cancer population. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of amivantamab in combination with lazertinib versus osimertinib in Asian participants from the phase 3 MARIPOSA study who had treatment-na\u00efve advanced non-small cell lung cancer with common EGFR mutations. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to receive amivantamab-lazertinib, osimertinib alone, or lazertinib alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival based on blinded independent central review per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, and safety. Exploratory endpoints included extracranial progression-free survival and post-progression outcomes. Of 1074 randomized participants, 629 were Asian, with 250 and 251 randomized to the amivantamab-lazertinib and osimertinib arms, respectively. Among Asian participants, at a median follow-up of 22.5\u00a0months, amivantamab-lazertinib showed a 35\u00a0% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus osimertinib (hazard ratio, 0.65; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Consistent with the overall population, median progression-free survival was 27.5 and 18.3\u00a0months in the amivantamab-lazertinib and osimertinib arms, respectively. The objective response rate was 88\u00a0% for amivantamab-lazertinib versus 85\u00a0% for osimertinib. The median duration of response among confirmed responders improved by 8.6\u00a0months for amivantamab-lazertinib versus osimertinib. Favorable trends were also seen for overall survival, extracranial progression-free survival, and post-progression outcomes for amivantamab-lazertinib over osimertinib. Adverse events in Asian participants were similar to those in the overall population. Amivantamab-lazertinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival versus osimertinib in Asian participants, with a tolerable safety profile. These results were consistent with those in the overall population.",

    "title": "Difficult Decisions in the Multidisciplinary Treatment of Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "The management of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved dramatically over the past three decades. Once limited to surgery, treatment strategies now include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. Despite advances in clinical trials and updated guidelines, several gray areas persist in practice. This review highlights two commonly encountered dilemmas, framed by recent trial data. The first dilemma is centered on the question: for a patient with a 4.1 cm node-negative tumor, is the optimal approach neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or perioperative chemoimmunotherapy? CheckMate 816 demonstrated improved pathological complete response and event-free survival with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Perioperative approaches, combining neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy, showed promising outcomes in KEYNOTE-671, AEGEAN, and CheckMate 77T, whereas IMpower010 and KEYNOTE-091 demonstrated benefit with adjuvant therapy. Moreover, for patients with EGFR or ALK mutations, targeted therapies have shifted the treatment paradigm, as shown in the ADAURA and ALINA trials. However, no head-to-head comparisons among these strategies exist, limiting decision-making. The second dilemma involves a hypothetical scenario of a patient a with biopsy-proven T1cN2 disease: should treatment involve neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery, or chemoradiation followed by consolidation immunotherapy (durvalumab) or targeted agents (such as\u00a0osimertinib)? The PACIFIC and LAURA trials support the latter approach for unresectable disease, while CheckMate 816 supports surgery for resectable N2 cases. Yet defining resectability remains subjective, especially with multistation or bulky N2 disease. While the upcoming AJCC 9th edition proposes a subdivision of N2 into N2a (single-station) and N2b (multi-station), offering a potential step forward, this refinement has yet to translate into clear clinical guidance. These scenarios highlight the need for prospective, stage stratified trials, designed to address these pertinent questions so that improved guidelines may help clinical decision making in borderline cases.",

We report updated popPK modeling incorporating AURA3 and FLAURA data (advanced NSCLC); model validation used ADAURA data (resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC). Updated popPK analyses were based on patients from AURA (n\u2009=\u2009599), AURA2 (n\u2009=\u2009210), AURA3 (n\u2009=\u2009277), and FLAURA (n\u2009=\u2009278) using a linear one-compartmental disposition model for osimertinib and its metabolite, AZ5104, with first-order oral absorption. A full covariate model, using Monte Carlo simulations, was developed to assess the effects of covariates on osimertinib and AZ5104 clearance. External validation was conducted using ADAURA study data (n\u2009=\u2009325). In the final popPK model, the apparent clearance and volume of distribution of osimertinib (14.3\u2009L/h; 918\u2009L) and AZ5104 (31.3\u2009L/h; 143\u2009L) were comparable to previous analyses. Albumin levels and body weight influenced osimertinib PK, but the effects were not considered clinically meaningful; other covariates had no impact on PK. Goodness-of-fit plots indicated that the model adequately described all data. Visual predictive checks showed that the final model validated osimertinib steady-state PK for adjuvant treatment. PopPK modeling indicated that osimertinib dose adjustment is not required for patients' age, sex, body weight, race, smoking status, or line of therapy, confirming that a fixed 80\u2009mg once-daily dose is optimal for osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Treatment resistance due to gene alterations remains a challenge for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (a/mNSCLC). A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to describe resistance mutation profiles and their impact on clinical outcomes in adults with a/mNSCLC in the United States (US). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase (2018-August 2022) identified 2986 records. Among 45 included studies, osimertinib was the most commonly reported treatment (osimertinib alone: 15 studies; as one of the treatment options: 18 studies), followed by other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; 5 studies) and non-TKIs (1 study). For first-line (1L) and second-line (2L) osimertinib, the most frequent EGFR-dependent resistance mechanisms were T790M loss (1L: 15.4%; 2L: 20.5-49%) and C797X mutation (1L: 2.9-12.5%; 2L: 1.4-22%). EGFR-independent mechanisms included MET amplification (1L: 0.6-66%; 2L: 7.2-19%), TP53 mutation (1L: 29.2-33.3%), and CCNE1 amplification (1L: 7.9%; 2L: 10.3%). For patients receiving osimertinib, EGFR T790M mutation loss, EGFR/MET/HER2 amplification, RET fusion, and PIK3CA mutation were associated with worse progression-free survival. Resistance mechanisms resulting from current NSCLC treatments in the US are complex, underscoring the need to address such heterogeneous resistance profiles and improve outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutated a/mNSCLC.",

Time to discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using log rank tests between treatment or mutation groups. Among 52 patients identified, 32 (62\u00a0%) were treated with osimertinib and 20 (38\u00a0%) with afatinib. 20 had mutations in G719X (38\u00a0%), 12 in L861Q (23\u00a0%), and 5 in S768I (10\u00a0%). 34(65\u00a0%) had compound mutations: 20(62\u00a0%) had AM\u00a0+\u00a0CM, and 14(38\u00a0%) had\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 AMs. Among G719X (n\u00a0=\u00a020), afatinib was associated with longer time to discontinuation (TTD) (log-rank: p\u00a0=\u00a00.047) and longer OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043) vs. osimertinib. Median TTD (mTTD) was 20.3\u00a0m[95\u00a0%CI 7.3-24.2] and 9.4[1.7-14.0], respectively. For L861Q (n\u00a0=\u00a012), osimertinib was associated with longer TTD vs. afatinib (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), with no statistical difference in OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.215). mTTD was 7.2\u00a0m[2.2-12.3] and 1.3[0-3.1], respectively. In AM\u00a0+\u00a0CM (n\u00a0=\u00a020), osimertinib was associated with longer TTD and OS compared to those receiving afatinib (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042, respectively). Patients with G719X alterations experienced longer TTD and OS with afatinib than osimertinib. In contrast, patients with L861Q alterations had longer TTD with osimertinib. In AM\u00a0+\u00a0CM pts, TTD and OS with osimertinib were longer than afatinib, suggesting that classical mutations may be driving the outcomes. Atypical EGFR mutations may warrant distinct treatment recommendations based on the specific mutation(s) identified, but more studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib has become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Although previous studies reported that the BRAF V600E mutation is a unique resistance mechanism to osimertinib, the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring both EGFR and acquired BRAF-V600E comutations remains unclear. Here, we report a case of a 36-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring the EGFR L858R mutation. She received osimertinib for 24 months and experienced progressive disease. Rebiopsy pathology revealed that the lung lesion was still adenocarcinoma, and NGS revealed gains of BRAF V600E and TP53 mutations in addition to the EGFR L858R mutation. This patient subsequently received aumolertinib in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib and achieved a complete response for 8 months. In conclusion, acquired BRAF-V600E mutations may contribute to osimertinib resistance. Aumolertinib plus BRAF inhibitors improves outcomes in patients with EGFR-L858R and acquired BRAF-V600E comutant lung adenocarcinoma in whom osimertinib treatment has failed.",

    "abstract": "The third-generation mutation-selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) osimertinib (or AZD9291) effectively induces apoptosis in EGFR mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) cells. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL or TNFSF10) is known as a death ligand that initiates apoptosis via binding to its cell surface death receptors such as DR5. In this study, we found that osimertinib and other EGFR-TKIs increased the expression of TRAIL primarily in EGFRm NSCLC cell lines. This effect was accompanied with increased IL6 expression and STAT3 activation. Inhibition of STAT3 with either protein degradation or gene knockout abrogated the ability of osimertinib or recombinant human IL6 to elevate TRAIL levels. Moreover, osimertinib increased STAT3-dependent transcription of TRAIL via two STAT3 novel binding sites present in the TRAIL 5'flanking region. Hence, osimertinib induces IL6/STAT3-mediated TRAIL expression in EGFRm NSCLC cells. While osimertinib lost the ability to induce TRAIL expression in osimertinib-resistant EGFRm NSCLC, knockdown or knockout of TRAIL in sensitive EGFRm NSCLC cells rendered them less sensitive to osimertinib both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, TRAIL elevation contributes to the induction of apoptosis by osimertinib in EGFRm NSCLC cells. Furthermore, osimertinib increased membrane-bound TRAIL and DR5 membrane clustering and DR5 knockdown significantly compromised the cell-killing effect of osimertinib, together suggesting a DR5-dependent effect. Collectively, this study has revealed a previously undiscovered connection between TRAIL induction and osimertinib-induced apoptosis in EGFRm NSCLC cells, increasing our understanding of mechanisms accounting for apoptosis induced by osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the most common type of lung cancer. The majority of patients with lung cancer characterized by activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), benefit from therapies entailing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In this regard, osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, has greatly improved the outcome for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. The AURA and FLAURA trials displayed the superiority of the third-generation TKI in both first- and second-line settings, making it the drug of choice for treating patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer. Unfortunately, the onset of resistance is almost inevitable. On-target mechanisms of resistance include new mutations (e.g., C797S) in the kinase domain of EGFR, while among the off-target mechanisms, amplification of MET or HER2, mutations in downstream signaling molecules, oncogenic fusions, and phenotypic changes (e.g., EMT) have been described. This review focuses on the strategies that are currently being investigated, in preclinical and clinical settings, to overcome resistance to osimertinib, including the use of fourth-generation TKIs, PROTACs, bispecific antibodies, and ADCs, as monotherapy and as part of combination therapies.",

    "abstract": "The resistance of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially against the EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S mutations, remains an ongoing challenge. In this study, we screened a total of 2.05 million compounds from the ChEMBL database through virtual screening, identifying five promising candidates with high binding affinities and favourable ADMET properties. These candidates were further evaluated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealing more restricted conformational changes and enhanced stability compared to Osimertinib. Protein-ligand interaction analyses highlighted a broader range of stabilizing interactions in the binding domain. Additionally, the binding free energies of the compounds showed that compounds 1-5 ranged from -34.95 to -45.54\u00a0kcal/mol, which were lower compared to Osimertinib (-34.49\u00a0kcal/mol), suggesting a stronger binding affinity. Subsequently, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided further insights into the electronic properties of the compounds, which were essential for understanding the compounds' reactivity and potential interactions with the target protein. In conclusion, the five identified compounds exhibit promising drug-like properties and may serve as lead candidates for the development of new treatments targeting EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S resistance mutations in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a standard treatment for first- or second-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, options are limited for patients with acquired EGFR T790M mutations resistant to first- or second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of combining osimertinib with anlotinib in this patient population and explored circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker of treatment outcomes. In this prospective, single-arm, phase II trial, 31 patients with advanced NSCLC resistant to prior first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs therapy received osimertinib (80 mg daily) and anlotinib (12 mg daily on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle). Efficacy endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ctDNA was analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor mutation status and treatment response. The median PFS was 16.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.8-23.6, 90% CI 14.2-20.9), and the median OS was 31.4 months (95% CI 27.3-not reached). The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.2% (95% CI 30.6-66.6%), with a disease control rate (DCR) of 96.8% (95% CI 86.3-100.0%). ctDNA analysis showed that activating EGFR mutation clearance after two treatment cycles correlated with significantly longer PFS and OS. The regimen was well-tolerated, with no grade 4 or higher adverse events observed. Osimertinib combined with anlotinib demonstrates promising long-term efficacy and manageable safety in EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC. Clearance of ctDNA, particularly of EGFR mutations, could serve as a valuable predictive biomarker, supporting the implementation of personalized treatment strategies.

However, its economic value relative to the standard therapy, osimertinib, remains unclear. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of AL regimen compared with osimertinib in US and Chinese healthcare settings. A partitioned survival model, comprising progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression, and death states, was developed using a Markov model. Clinical data were obtained from the recent Phase III MARIPOSA trial. Direct medical costs (including drug acquisition, administration, and adverse event management) were obtained from US and Chinese healthcare system data, public databases, and the literature. Health-state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Threshold analysis was performed to identify pricing strategies at specified willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Model robustness was assessed through sensitivity and scenario analyses, and additional subgroup analyses performed. In the base case analysis, the average costs of AL and osimertinib regimen were $1,030,524.3 (China: $234,270.87) and $466,922.0 (China: $20,075.35), respectively, and the QALYs achieved were 4.08 (China: 3.66) and 2.60 (China: 2.66), respectively. The ICERs for AL compared with osimertinib in the US and China were $563,602.3 and $214,195.51, respectively. Based on the respective WTP thresholds in the US and China, the AL regimen did not represent a cost-effective option. Sensitivity, scenario, and subgroup analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. Although AL regimen prolongs QALYs compared with osimertinib, it may not meet cost-effectiveness thresholds given current US pricing and simulated Chinese prices. These findings emphasize the need to consider policy implications and future pricing strategies.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is essential for cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, and migration. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling is frequently observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poor prognosis. This study aims to isolate and characterize extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by mutant EGFR lung cancer cell line PC9 and compare them with wild-type EGFR lung cancer cell line A549, while also evaluating the effect of gefitinib treatment on EV secretion and cargo composition. The two lung cancer cell lines were cultured with 2% EV-free serum, and EVs were subsequently isolated by differential ultra centrifugation. EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)\u00a0and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for quantification size and shape\u00a0determination. Western blot analysis confirmed the enrichment and purity of isolated EVs. Results showed that EGFR mutation significantly increased EV release and altered their size, compared to EVs released by wild-type EGFR cells. In addition to classical EV markers such as CD81, Flotillin- 1, and TSG101, Western blot analysis also detected phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) selectively packaged into EVs from PC9 cells. Gefitinib treatment significantly reduced EV secretion in PC9 cells and led to a marked decrease in p-EGFR incorporation into EVs, indicating that EV biogenesis and compostion are modulated by active EGFR signaling. In conclusion, this study highlights the significant influence of EGFR activation on EV secretion and cargo composition while demonstrating that EGFR inhibition via gefitinib alters EV-mediated signaling in lung cancer cells. These findings provide insights into tumor behavior, EV-mediated oncogenic communication, and the potential use of EVs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib (GFB) is a well-established EGFR inhibitor used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has shown resistance in certain cases of this cancer. In this work, we aimed to enhance GFB's inhibitory activity using alchemical free energy calculations, leading to the design of five new quinazoline derivatives. Among these, compound 8a was the most potent, inhibiting EGFR at 10\u00a0\u00b5M and showing significant antiproliferative effects at 25\u00a0\u00b5M. Further optimization identified two new compounds, NCU00 and NCU01, with improved EGFR inhibition and superior cytotoxicity in four NSCLC cell lines compared to GFB. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed crucial interactions that contribute to the enhanced inhibitory activity of NCU00 and NCU01. Toxicological assessments in mice showed no adverse effects on kidney or liver function, and NCU01 exhibited no developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos. This study highlights the effectiveness of alchemical free energy methods in optimizing quinazoline-bearing EGFR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) widely used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. However, resistance to osimertinib frequently develops, limiting its long-term effectiveness. This study aimed to establish a lung cancer TKI-resistant model and identify Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) components that could reverse TKI resistance, enhancing lung cancer sensitivity to targeted therapies, while exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms. Osimertinib-resistant cell lines and organoids were developed using a dose-escalation approach. A screen of 302 traditional Chinese medicine monomers revealed compounds that increased sensitivity to osimertinib. RNA sequencing and limited proteolysis coupled with small molecule mapping were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which jaceosidin reverses resistance. The efficacy of the jaceosidin and osimertinib combination was confirmed in cell lines, organoids, and a mouse model. The osimertinib-resistant lung cancer model was successfully established, and 12 compounds were identified that enhanced the sensitivity of resistant cells to osimertinib. Among these, Jaceosidin, a flavonoid compound derived from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC., was confirmed to notably increase osimertinib sensitivity. Mechanistic studies, including limited proteolysis and RNA interference analysis, demonstrated that Jaceosidin directly interacts with Damage Specific DNA Binding Protein 1 (DDB1), promoting its protein expression and downregulating CDK1/Cyclin B1 levels. This interaction induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, thereby sensitizing lung cancer cells to osimertinib. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the combination of Jaceosidin and osimertinib significantly inhibited tumor growth in osimertinib-resistant models. These findings offer new insights into the role of DDB1 in overcoming osimertinib resistance and suggest that combining jaceosidin with osimertinib may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs treatment in resistant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the standard therapy for patients with chemotherapy-naive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, some patients treated with osimertinib experience progressive disease (PD). Therefore, this study aimed to explore mechanisms underlying osimertinib resistance, focusing on early PD (within 6\u2009months). This multicentre prospective observational study enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC receiving osimertinib as the first-line anti-cancer therapy. Mutations in cancer-associated genes were analysed using next-generation sequencing of circulating tumour DNA samples collected before osimertinib treatment and on detection of PD. Between May 2019 and January 2021, 188 patients were enrolled, of whom 125 (66%) were women and 96 (51%) had EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. In this interim analysis, 78 patients experienced PD and 36 experienced early PD. Compared with patients without early PD, those with early PD were more likely to test positive for EGFR-activating mutations at baseline (86.1% vs. 63.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and had significantly more co-occurring gene mutations in addition to EGFR mutations (2.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.49 vs. 1.97\u2009\u00b1\u20091.37, p\u2009=\u20090.002). In three patients with early PD, one patient each had a germline BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRINP3 mutation. EGFR mutations in ctDNA and multiple co-occurring gene mutations at baseline are associated with poor outcomes and early PD. Plasma-based serial comprehensive gene profiling could help predict and identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from osimertinib treatment.

Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework. Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-1.44).

    "abstract": "The US (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-accelerated approval pathway facilitates early access to oncology drugs based on surrogate endpoints, with required confirmatory post-marketing trials. However, regulatory decisions vary globally, with some drugs withdrawn in the US remaining approved in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of Japanese professional society guidelines, evaluating recommendations for seven accelerated approval cancer drugs withdrawn from the US market but retained in Japan. We assessed for level of evidence and level of treatment preference ratings with consensus across guidelines issued by the corresponding Japanese professional societies. Four of the seven drugs (57%) were recommended as highly or moderately preferred treatment options in Japanese guidelines: gemtuzumab ozogamicin for acute myeloid leukemia, gefitinib for EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer, bevacizumab for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, and atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel for PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer. Detailed analysis of regulatory history and background of guideline recommendation revealed discrepancies in the assessment of clinical benefits: gemtuzumab ozogamicin failed to demonstrate benefits amid safety concerns, while gefitinib, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab were more controversial, although they did not demonstrate improved overall survival in post-marketing trials. Despite regulatory withdrawal in the US due to unproven clinical benefits, drugs retained in Japan received positive guideline recommendations. This finding highlights regional variations in regulatory decisions and different approaches to benefit-risk assessments, suggesting a need for improved transparency in Japan's regulatory decisions and guideline recommendations, with clearer justifications for endorsing drugs that are considered to have unproven clinical benefits in the US.",

Although renal dysfunction associated with osimertinib treatment is reported to be rare, detailed information on this adverse effect is needed because cytotoxic drugs such as pemetrexed are also widely administered for NSCLC but cannot be used in individuals with renal dysfunction. We retrospectively collected clinical data including the serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during osimertinib treatment for 130 NSCLC patients. Serum creatinine and eGFR worsened gradually during osimertinib treatment, with the median value of creatinine at the point of greatest deterioration differing significantly from that at baseline (0.93 versus 0.72\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Seventy patients (54\u00a0%) experienced worsening of the CTCAE grade for creatinine increased, with the frequency of patients with grade 1 or 2 being increased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) at the point of greatest deterioration relative to baseline (grade 1, 46.9\u00a0% versus 14.6\u00a0%; grade 2, 14.6\u00a0% versus 0.8\u00a0%, respectively). A higher serum creatinine level at baseline was a significant risk factor for worsening of the CTCAE grade (odds ratio of 1.66, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The median serum creatinine and eGFR at 4 weeks after osimertinib discontinuation had improved to levels similar to those for baseline. Renal dysfunction occurred frequently during osimertinib treatment but was ameliorated after drug discontinuation, suggesting that, although renal function should be carefully monitored, its impairment is not likely to affect subsequent chemotherapy in most patients.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation have a high rate of brain metastases, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the principal therapeutic approach. However, acquired targeted therapy resistance is the main reason for EGFR-TKIs' treatment failure. At present, the mechanism of intracranial acquired targeted therapy resistance is limited, mainly due to the lack of a cell line that can be used for its study. A brain parenchymal metastatic sample that progressed after third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment was used to establish a cell line named AlmoR1. The genetic characteristics of the cell line were evaluated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and whole-exome sequencing analysis. The phenotypic characteristics were characterized by CCK8, western blot, HE staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and orthotopic brain tumor model. The cell line we successfully established, AlmoR1, can be passed in\u00a0vitro stably. STR analysis revealed it was a novel NSCLC BM cell line. It harbors the EGFR E746_A750del (ex19del) mutation, and the IC50 to almonertinib and osimertinib of AlmoR1 was significantly higher than that of sensitive cells. In our orthotopic brain tumor model construction with AlmoR1 cells, 75% (3/4) tumor formation can be observed in the living system. These data suggest that the established cell line, AlmoR1, preserved the resistance to broad third-generation EGFR-TKIs and good tumorigenicity in an intracranial orthotopic model, so that it can serve as a new tool to elucidate the pathogenesis, explore new treatment methods, and conduct the development of new drugs for targeted therapy resistance of brain metastases.",

    "abstract": "A precise balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination is crucial for cellular regulation. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 54 (USP54), an active deubiquitinase (DUB), modulates the ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). While the significance of USP54 in tumorigenesis is known, its specific function in cancer progression remains unclear. This study investigates the role of USP54 in gefitinib sensitivity in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Using western blotting and next-generation sequencing, we examined gene expression changes in ubiquitination pathways. USP54 deficiency and its impact on cell viability and gefitinib response were evaluated in 2D and 3D spheroid cancer models. Prolonged gefitinib exposure altered the expression of 20 deubiquitinase-regulating genes. Notably, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3, downregulated by gefitinib, was identified as a key regulator of EGFR ubiquitination in gefitinib-sensitive PC9 cells. Silencing USP54 in resistant NSCLC cells increased gefitinib-induced EGFR ubiquitination and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, enhancing drug susceptibility in resistant spheroids. USP54 upregulation in gefitinib-treated cells was associated with reduced EGFR ubiquitination, stabilizing EGFR and promoting cell survival. These findings suggest USP54 as a critical modulator of EGFR stability and a potential therapeutic target to overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.",

This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase III study. Patients with chemotherapy-na\u00efve advanced or recurrent NSqNSCLC harboring EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation) were randomly assigned (1:1) to EGFR-TKI monotherapy or EGFR-TKI plus intercalated chemotherapy group.

The EGFR-TKI was changed from gefitinib to osimertinib in October 2018 (gefitinib cohort: n=308, osimertinib cohort: n=193).

    "abstract": "Among the oncogenic alterations of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the EGFR gene mutation is observed in 15% of patients in France, particularly among non-smokers and women. Treatment mainly relies on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR. In first-line metastatic treatment, osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, has become the standard, improving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to first- or second-generation TKIs. The combination of TKI/chemotherapy (osimertinib/carboplatine-pemetrexed) and TKI/bispecific antibodies (e.g., amivantamab/lazertinib) are alternatives under evaluation, with benefits in PFS but increased toxicity. In case of progression under first- or second-generation TKIs, the most common resistance is the T790M mutation, which can be targeted by osimertinib. For other resistances, platinum-based chemotherapy remains an option. Amivantamab combined with chemotherapy has shown an improvement in PFS in the second line and has early access in France. Other emerging approaches include conjugated antibodies (patritumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan) and next-generation TKIs. In the future, personalized treatment based on the molecular profile and early response to TKIs could optimize management, particularly by integrating predictive markers such as EGFR clearance under treatment.",

    "abstract": "\"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\" mutations are pivotal in the pathogenesis of \"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),\" which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The advent of third and fourth-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly advanced the therapeutic landscape for EGFR-mutant NSCLC, particularly in overcoming resistance mutations such as T790M and C797S. This review delves into the current clinical status, efficacy, safety profiles, and regulatory approvals of third-generation EGFR TKIs, including Osimertinib, Lazertinib, Furmonertinib, Aumolertinib, Rezivertinib, Befotertinib, Sunvozertinib. Furthermore, it explores emerging fourth-generation EGFR TKIs designed to address resistance mechanisms beyond those targeted by their predecessors. Notable fourth-generation candidates such as TQB3804, BPI-361175, BDTX-1535, WJ13404, QLH11811, H002, HS-10375, BBT-207, JIN-A02, and HS-10504 are highlighted for their potential to overcome the C797S mutation. The review emphasizes the importance of these advanced inhibitors in enhancing \"progression-free survival and overall survival rates\". By evaluating the therapeutic potential and limitations of these EGFR TKIs, this review aims to guide future research in the management of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. This acts as guiding beacon for the strategic design and development of third and fourth generation EGFR-TK inhibitors to overcome the drug resistance hurdles in the development of EGFR-TK inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, effectively treats EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease, a potentially fatal complication of osimertinib, involves an increase in lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). As the precise role of these lymphocytes is unknown, we investigated the pathogenesis of osimertinib-induced pneumonitis using BALF obtained from patients, and an osimertinib-induced pneumonitis mouse model. Mass cytometry revealed the presence of CCR7+\u2009CD45RA+\u2009na\u00efve T cells in the BALF of patients with osimertinib-induced pneumonitis. Body weight measurements, BALF analysis, histopathological evaluation and RNA sequencing of mouse lung tissue were performed to investigate immune cell involvement and the mechanisms underlying osimertinib-induced pneumonitis. In the mouse model, administration of osimertinib after naphthalene-induced damage to the bronchiolar epithelium exacerbated lung inflammation and resulted in significant weight loss. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the infiltration of CCR7+\u2009cells into the lungs of mice treated with naphthalene and osimertinib. Bulk RNA sequencing identified an upregulation of chemokine-related biological processes, with increased expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (Ccl21) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (Ccl8) in the lung tissue. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining confirmed elevated expression of Ccl21 and Ccl8 in the distal bronchiolar epithelium.

For non-metastatic NSCLC, addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors post-chemoradiotherapy has improved outcomes in stage III disease and during the perioperative phase for stages IB-IIIA. Recently, adjuvant osimertinib and alectinib therapy have demonstrated improved survival for patients with EGFR or ALK alterations, respectively, and they have been established as standard therapies. Furthermore, osimertinib has proven effective when administered following chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC. These studies highlight the necessity to assess EGFR and ALK status to guide treatment decisions for almost all NSCLC patients, regardless of whether they will undergo curative surgery, chemoradiotherapy, or as palliative chemotherapy. This review summarizes recent trials on perioperative and post-chemoradiation therapy and argues that molecular testing is required for non-metastatic NSCLC to improve patient outcomes.",

Recent advances in molecular profiling, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with improved patient outcomes. The increased adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening has enhanced early detection, enabling intervention at more curable stages. Molecular diagnostics now play a pivotal role in guiding treatment strategies, with actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) informing the use of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, NRG1, and other targeted inhibitors in both early and advanced settings. For instance, targeted therapies are increasingly being integrated into early-stage management, with adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR-mutated NSCLC and alectinib for ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrating substantial survival benefits. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become a cornerstone of treatment for AGA-negative NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, and is increasingly being utilized in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, emerging therapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and novel immunotherapeutic agents show promise in addressing resistance mechanisms and improving outcomes in advanced-stage disease. Although new challenges arise, the evolving NSCLC treatment paradigm continues to prioritize precision medicine, offering hope for prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life for patients.",

Osimertinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare and potentially fatal pulmonary toxic manifestation of drug therapy. At present, there is no international consensus on the risks and treatment of the osimertinib-induced ILD. We report a case of a 56-year-old woman who was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with lung hilum, mediastinal lymph nodes and brain metastases (T4N3M1c stage IVB). The patient received targeted treatment with osimertinib after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. But she developed ILD after osimertinib treatment. Following active symptomatic treatment and hormone treatment, the lung injury alleviated. The patient was retreated with furmonertinib combined with prednisone and did not experience ILD again. So far, she has survived for 14 months without disease progression. Retreatment with furmonertinib under prednisone could be considered as an effective therapeutic option after risk-benefit assessment for EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In the FLAURA trial, osimertinib demonstrated longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to gefitinib or erlotinib. In the trial, dose reductions occurred in 5% of patients, primarily due to QT prolongation. However, various adverse events can also lead to dose reductions in clinical practice, and the efficacy of osimertinib after dose reduction remains unclear. The present study was conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of osimertinib dose reduction. This monocentric retrospective study was conducted at Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital. Ninety patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer receiving osimertinib as their first-line therapy between August 2018 and December 2021 were included. Of the cohort, 23 patients had an osimertinib dose reduction during their clinical course. The dose reduction group tended to have a lower median body weight and a higher proportion of elderly patients aged 80 years or older. The median PFS was 21.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.22-34.18) in the dose reduction group and 18.6 (95% CI: 13.04-24.23) months in the regular-dose group. The median OS was 29.6 months (95% CI: 17.44-41.70) in the osimertinib dose-reduction group and 37.7 (95% CI: 27.10-48.23) months in the regular-dose group. Dose reduction did not significantly impact the time-dependent hazard ratio (HR) for PFS (HR 1.22 [95% CI: 0.55-1.89]) or OS (HR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.64-2.42]). The adverse events leading to dose reduction were mainly rash, anorexia, and paronychia, and no fatal adverse events were observed after dose reduction. The present study suggests that dose reduction may not compromise the efficacy of osimertinib. However, the clinical impact of dose reduction is not fully understood. Physicians should carefully weigh its benefits and risks before implementation.",

This study compared real-world clinical outcomes of 1L osimertinib versus 1st or 2nd generation EGFR-TKIs (1/2G-TKIs) in patients with EGFR+ mNSCLC. Nine academic cancer centers in the US participated in the retrospective cohort study. Patients aged \u226518 years with EGFR+ mNSCLC and treated with 1L EGFR-TKI were included. Clinical outcomes included real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS), duration of treatment (DOT), time to next treatment (TTNT), central nervous system incidence-free survival (CNS-IFS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable regression models were used to control for differences in patient characteristics (p < 0.1) between the osimertinib and 1/2G-TKI cohorts. The study included 181 osimertinib patients and 171 1/2G-TKI patients. Osimertinib had a longer rwPFS compared to 1/2G-TKIs (median PFS, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 16.2 months (13.2-19.7) vs. 10.8 months (9.5-12.7); hazard Ratio [HR], 95 % CI: 0.60 (0.44-0.82).

A trend toward an increased DFS event rate after completion of 3\u2009years adjuvant treatment in ADAURA suggests that some patients may benefit from longer adjuvant osimertinib treatment. We therefore explored whether tumor-informed, circulating tumor DNA-based, molecular residual disease (MRD) could predict recurrence in an exploratory post hoc analysis of 220 patients (n\u2009=\u2009112 osimertinib; n\u2009=\u2009108 placebo) from ADAURA. MRD preceded imaging DFS events in this study by a median of 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.6) months.

In the osimertinib group, DFS or MRD events were detected in 28 (25%) patients; most events occurred following osimertinib cessation (19 of 28, 68%) and within 12\u2009months of stopping osimertinib (11 of 19, 58%). At 24\u2009months after osimertinib, the DFS and MRD event-free rate was 66%. In this study, MRD preceded DFS events in most patients across both arms. DFS and MRD event-free status was maintained for most patients during adjuvant osimertinib treatment and posttreatment follow-up, with most MRD or DFS events occurring after osimertinib treatment discontinuation or completion.

    "abstract": "To investigate the role of CD105 in mediating drug resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Imaging mass cytometry was conducted on 66 NSCLC tumors, 44 of which had EGFR mutations. We correlated clinical variables, including overall survival, with CD105 (endoglin) expression, a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Two osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant cell lines were developed to study the effects of EGFR and CD105 disruption. Single cell RNA sequencing of the isogenic parental and osimertinib resistant lines was performed. Additionally, ATAC sequencing and Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by profiling Translation inHibition analysis (SCENITH) was used to assess promoter chromatin status and glycolytic state. We found a negative correlation between CD105 expression and overall survival in patients. Treatment with osimertinib or EGFR knockdown significantly elevated CD105 expression in EGFR-mutant cell lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of cells with heightened endothelial characteristics and altered pyrimidine metabolism, associated with osimertinib resistance. These cells exhibited a slow-cycling behavior, characterized by elevated chromatin condensation and reduced glycolysis. Combining osimertinib with carotuximab, a CD105 neutralizing antibody, significantly reduced the slow-cycling transcriptomic signature, increased chromatin accessibility, and restored glycolysis compared to osimertinib treatment alone. Mass spectrometry confirmed that carotuximab re-engaged EGFR signaling by coupling it with CD105. Consequently, carotuximab re-sensitized resistant tumors to osimertinib by increasing their mitotic index and ERK signaling in mouse models. Carotuximab effectively reduced the slow-cycling cell population and restored osimertinib sensitivity, offering a promising strategy for managing refractory NSCLC.",

    "title": "NNMT promotes acquired EGFR-TKI resistance by forming EGR1 and lactate-mediated double positive feedback loops in non-small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are remarkably effective for treating EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients inevitably develop acquired drug resistance, resulting in recurrence or metastasis. It is important to identify novel effective therapeutic targets to reverse acquired TKI resistance. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was upregulated in EGFR-TKI resistant cells and tissues via EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation. High NNMT levels were correlated with poor prognosis in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, which could promote resistance to EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NNMT catalyzed the conversion of nicotinamide to 1-methyl nicotinamide by depleting S-adenosyl methionine (the methyl group donor), leading to a reduction in H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and subsequent epigenetic activation of EGR1 and ALDH3A1. In addition, ALDH3A1 activation increased lactic acid levels, which further promoted NNMT expression via p300-mediated histone H3K18 lactylation on its promoter. Thus, NNMT mediates the formation of a double positive feedback loop via EGR1 and lactate, EGR1/NNMT/EGR1 and NNMT/ALDH3A1/lactate/NNMT. Moreover, the combination of a small-molecule inhibitor for NNMT (NNMTi) and osimertinib exhibited promising potential for the treatment of TKI resistance in an NSCLC osimertinib-resistant xenograft model. The combined contribution of these two positive feedback loops promotes EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Our findings provide new insight into the role of histone methylation and histone lactylation in TKI resistance. The pivotal NNMT-mediated positive feedback loop may serve as a powerful therapeutic target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "EGFR exon 19 insertions (EGFRex19ins) are rare EGFR mutations. Their clinical-genomic characteristics and outcomes with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain uncertain. We evaluated the clinical-genomic characteristics and outcomes of EGFR-TKIs for EGFRex19ins in the multi-institutional prospective lung cancer genomic screening project (LC-SCRUM-Asia). We also studied preclinical Ba/F3 models expressing EGFR-K745_E746insIPVAIK (Ba/F3-IPVAIK) to investigate their sensitivity to 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-generation, and EGFR exon 20 insertion-active TKIs. In LC-SCRUM-Asia, 16,204 NSCLC patients were enrolled from March 2015 to December 2023. EGFRex19ins were detected in 13 samples (0.1\u00a0% of NSCLC). The median age was 72\u00a0years (range, 38-80); most patients were female (77\u00a0%), had adenocarcinoma (92\u00a0%), and were never-smokers (62\u00a0%). Twelve patients (93\u00a0%) had EGFR-K745_E746insIPVAIK, while one (7\u00a0%) had EGFR-K745_E746insVPVAIK. The most frequent co-mutation was TP53 (62\u00a0%); no patients had other driver alterations. Six patients (46\u00a0%) tested positive for EGFR exon 19 deletions with PCR-based Cobas EGFR test, likely due to cross-reactivity arising from sequence homology. Twelve patients received EGFR-TKIs; five (42\u00a0%) experienced partial response. In the preclinical study, Ba/F3-IPVAIK showed the highest sensitivity to 2nd-generation EGFR-TKIs compared to other EGFR-TKIs. Structural studies supported these consistent results. When broken down by EGFR-TKI generations, response rates for 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-generation TKIs were 50\u00a0% (1/2), 80\u00a0% (4/5), and 0\u00a0% (0/5), respectively. The median PFS for 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-generation TKIs were 8.7 (95\u00a0% CI, 7.4-NR), 14.7 (95\u00a0% CI, 8.0-NR), and 4.4 (95\u00a0% CI, 3.4-NR) months, respectively. Our preclinical, structural, and clinical findings indicate 2nd-generation EGFR-TKIs are more effective for EGFRex19ins compared to other TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular oncology have increasingly illuminated the role of germline EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This case report presents the presence of a unique familial occurrence of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC. A mother and son, both never-smokers of Caucasian ethnicity, were diagnosed with advanced metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. In one patient, tumor molecular analysis by next generation sequencing (NGS) identified two EGFR mutations: the activating mutation c.2573T\u2009>\u2009G; p.Leu858Arg (p.L858R) in exon 21 of the EGFR gene, and the somatic non-pathogenic mutation c.2612\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009A; p.Ala871Glu (p.A871E) in exon 21 of the EGFR gene. The second patient also harbored the same two EGFR mutations. The patient underwent genetic testing which revealed the germline origin of the A871E mutation. Whether the presence of this mutations was associated with increased predisposition to cancer has yet to be determined. Our case report highlights the need for further exploration of the role of germline mutations, including the A871E mutation, in tumorigenesis and its implications for treatment response and inheritance patterns. The investigation and comprehension of the significance of each individual EGFR mutation hold the promise for potential in cancer prevention or early diagnosis within family cohorts and understanding the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in sporadic cases.",

This study seeks to delineate real-world survival outcomes in stage IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients undergoing treatment with EGFR-TKIs and to identify independent prognostic factors impacting overall survival (OS). The findings are expected to be a reference for clinicians in managing advanced lung cancer patients. Clinical characteristics from advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who received EGFR-TKIs were retrospectively analyzed to investigate the association between clinical factors and overall survival. The median OS was 40.60 months (95% confidence interval: 34.72-46.48 months), with expected 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 87.2%, 57.8%, and 34.0%, respectively. Patients exhibiting specific characteristics, such as being under 60 years old, having stage IVA disease, adenocarcinoma histology, no liver or brain metastases, negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA 21\u2009-\u20091), progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), and those who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy exhibited significantly longer survival times compared to patients with the opposite characteristics (being 60 years or older, having stage IVB or IVC disease, non-adenocarcinoma histology, presence of liver or brain metastases, positive for CEA, NSE, ProGRP, CYFRA 21\u2009-\u20091, and not receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy) (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Cox univariate and multivariate analyses identified pathological type, liver metastasis, brain metastasis, NSE, CYFRA 21\u2009-\u20091, EGFR-TKIs type, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy as independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs. Pathological type, liver metastasis, brain metastasis, NSE, and CYFRA 21\u2009-\u20091 were identified as independent risk factors for stage IV NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy were determined to be independent protective factors.

Activated BRAF mutations are regarded as an underappreciated oncogenic driver in NSCLC, typically occurring in a mutually exclusive manner with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, as well as ALK and ROS1 rearrangements. In recent years, advancements in multiple-gene panel testing have demonstrated that EGFR mutations and BRAF mutations can coexist. Notably, the secondary BRAF V600E mutation has been identified as one of the mechanisms contributing to resistance against EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. However, the role of co-occurring BRAF mutations and associated treatment strategies in patients with EGFR mutations has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the profile of adverse events related to combination therapy has not been previously evaluated.

In particular, in the FLAURA 2 phase III randomized trial, the combination of platin-based chemotherapy and osimertinib showed impressive PFS benefits as compared to single-agent osimertinib. Furthermore, in the MARIPOSA phase III randomized study, the combination of the anti-EGFR and anti-MET monoclonal antibody amivantamab combined with the new anti-EGFR TKI lazertinib demonstrated remarkable PFS benefit as compared to single agent osimertinib.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the first receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a critical role in neoplastic metastasis, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and apoptosis, making it a prime target for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown high efficacy and promise for cancer patients, resistance to these drugs often develops within a year due to alterations. The present study investigates the compensatory alterations in EGFR to understand the evolutionary process behind drug resistance. Our findings reveal that coevolutionary alterations expand the drug-binding pocket; leading to reduced drug efficacy and suggested that such changes significantly influence the structural adaptation of the EGFR against these drugs. Analysis such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), principal component analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) demonstrated that structures of wild EGFR docked with gefitinib are more stable which suggests its susceptibility towards drug than coevolution dependent double mutant. The findings were supported by MM-GBSA binding affinity analysis. The insights from this study highlighted the evolution-induced structural changes which contributes to drug resistance in EGFR and may certainly aid in designing more effective drugs.",

Overall, 752 patients were included who started treatment with erlotinib (n=418) or gefitinib (n=334) before October 2020. Median time-to-treatment discontinuation was 11.6 (95% CI 10.8-12.4) months, and median overall survival was 20.1 (95% CI 18.1-21.6) months. Shorter time-to-treatment discontinuation was independently associated with high socioeconomic deprivation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5 compared to the New Zealand Index of Deprivation 1-4 group), EGFR L858R mutations (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6 compared to exon 19 deletion), and distant disease at cancer diagnosis (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7 compared to localized or regional disease). The same factors were independently associated with shorter overall survival. Outcome estimates and predictors remained unchanged in sensitivity analyses. Outcomes from routine treatment with erlotinib and gefitinib in New Zealand patients with advanced EGFR-mutant nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer are comparable with those reported in randomized trials and other health care system-wide retrospective cohort studies. Socioeconomic status, EGFR mutation subtype, and disease extent at cancer diagnosis were independent predictors of treatment outcomes in that setting.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are an integral component in the drug development paradigm. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a biomarker is \"a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic intervention\" (FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group. BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Resource [Internet]. Silver Spring (MD): Food and Drug Administration (US); 2016-. Glossary. 2016 [Updated 2021 Nov 29, cited 2024 Apr 14]. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK338448/ Co-published by National Institutes of Health (US), Bethesda (MD)). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) defines a biomarker as \"an objective and quantifiable measure of a physiological process, pathological process or response to a treatment (excluding measurements of how an individual feels or functions\" European Medicines Agency (EMA). Biomaker. 2020a. Available from: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary-terms/biomarker#:~:text=Biomarker-,Biomarker,an%20individual%20feels%20or%20functions . Several clinical biomarkers are well-documented and have been used routinely for decades in health care settings and have long been accepted as valid endpoints for drug approval (for example, blood pressure measurement as a biomarker for cardiovascular health) (European Medicines Agency (EMA). Assessment report, TAGRISSO. 2016. Available from: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/tagrisso-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf . Accessed 15 Apr 2024). Recently, novel biomarkers have been identified and validated to accelerate developing innovative therapies indicated for serious human diseases, for example targeted/immune therapies of cancer (Chen in Med Drug Discov 21:100174, 2024). As indicators of the efficacy of new pharmacological treatments or therapeutic interventions, biomarkers can improve clinical trial efficacy and reduce uncertainty in regulatory decision making (Bakker et al. in Clin Pharmacol Ther 112:69-80, 2022; Califf in Exp Biol Med 243:213-221, 2018; Parker et al. in Cancer Med 10:1955-1963, 2021). This article describes case studies of recent drug approvals that successfully leveraged validated and non-validated biomarkers (i.e., tofersen for the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in adults; and osimertinib for treatment of patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). Best practices for biomarker selection and strategies for health authority biomarker qualification programs are presented along with an overview of current limitations and challenges to optimizing biomarker applications along the drug development continuum from regulatory, translational, and operational perspectives.",

We extracted data on patients \u2265 18 years diagnosed with advanced non-squamous NSCLC between 2015 and 2022 from the Cancer Registry of Norway and data on cancer drug therapy from the Norwegian Patient Registry and the Norwegian Prescribed Drug Registry. ToT was measured from the date treatment was collected or administered until the last dispensing was depleted or last hospital drug administration. OS was measured from date of diagnosis until death. In total, 5,279 patients were included, of whom 449 EGFR+, 131 ALK+ and 38 ROS1+. 75% of EGFR+ patients, 88% of ALK+ patients, and 58% of ROS1+ patients received at least one systemic treatment within the first three months after diagnosis. Median follow-up was 13, 19, and 4 months for EGFR+, ALK+, and ROS1+, respectively. The median ToT in first line (1L) for EGFR+ patients was 11 months for osimertinib (CI: 10.1-NA) and 9 months (CI: 8.2-11.2) for afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib and gefitinib. For ALK+ patients, median ToT in 1L was 20 months (CI: 14.7-23.7for alectinib, 11 months (CI: 4.7-NA) for brigatinib, and 7 months (CI: 2.9-21.6) for crizotinib. For the five ROS1+ patients treated with crizotinib in 1L, median ToT was 5 months (CI: 2.4-NA). For all patients with a targetable genomic alteration, unadjusted median OS was higher (p-value = 0.025) for patients diagnosed in 2020-2022 (median OS: 23 months, CI: 19.5-NA) compared to patients diagnosed in 2015-2019 (median: 19 months, CI: 16.5-21.2).

However, its efficacy may vary due to heterogeneous drug distribution, assessable through microdosed radiolabeled drugs and positron emission tomography (PET). Precision dosing using microdosed TKI-PET encounters challenges due to pharmacokinetic (PK) variations between micro- and therapeutic doses. This study aims to predict osimertinib's tissue concentration-time profiles for both microdose and therapeutic dose scenarios using a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, which incorporates nonlinear PK processes and target site occupancy. A target site PBPK model for osimertinib was developed to predict drug distribution across various tissues, including lung tumor, based on a previously published PBPK model. The model incorporated tissue-specific parameters and accounted for both linear and nonlinear pharmacokinetic processes, including EGFR-binding dynamics and tumor dynamics.

    "abstract": "The treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients was dramatically revolutionized by the introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical practice, both in advanced and locally advanced/early stages. The present work focuses on osimertinib use in locally advanced and early NSCLC stages. Phase 3 clinical trials have supported the use of osimertinib as the new standard of care, both in the adjuvant setting and in locally advanced disease. The ADAURA study reported an overall survival (OS) advantage for adjuvant osimertinib in completely resected stage II-IIIA EGFR-mutant tumors, while the LAURA study proved a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) and a delay of central nervous system metastasis development in EGFR-mutant patients treated with osimertinib maintenance after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced disease. In the neoadjuvant setting, data on osimertinib's efficacy are conflicting; therefore, the Neo-ADAURA study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant osimertinib alone or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC and common EGFR mutations. We discuss several issues that need to be clarified, such as the efficacy of the drug on uncommon mutations, the long-term impact on survival, and the management of resistance mechanisms. Moreover, we report the studies that are trying to identify potential biomarkers of response, such as the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), with the aim of selecting patients who will benefit most from osimertinib.",

This study aimed to report the long-term survival analysis and recurrent patterns. This was a single-arm, phase II clinical trial. Patients with resectable stage II-IIIA NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations were enrolled. Patients were administrated with preoperative gefitinib (250\u00a0mg once daily for 42\u00a0days), followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included the rate of major pathologic response (MPR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS). MPR was defined as the presence of no more than 10\u00a0% viable tumor. Chi-square test was used to assess the differences in CNS recurrence rates and recurrent patterns. Of the 33 intention-to-treat patients, ORR was 54.5\u00a0% (95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI), 37.7-70.7), and the rate of MPR was 24.2\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI, 11.9-40.4). Among the investigated 28 patients, the median follow-up was 108.5\u00a0months. The median OS was 89.8\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI, 44.37-NC), and the median DFS was 36.4\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI, 18.9-NC). In addition, MPR continued to indicate significantly improved DFS, as well as OS (DFS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015; OS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). The neoadjuvant gefitinib group showed prolonged DFS and OS than platinum doublet group (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.71, 95\u00a0% CI, 1.02-2.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.038; and HR\u00a0=\u00a02.31; 95\u00a0% CI, 1.28-4.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0044, respectively). There was a significant difference in the distant recurrence patterns between the two groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Moreover, the gefitinib group showed similar overall brain metastasis rate than platinum doublet group (21.4\u00a0% versus 27.5\u00a0%). With satisfying prognosis benefits and acceptable brain metastasis rate in long-term follow-up, gefitinib exhibited clinical viability for operable stage II-IIIA EGFR-mutant NSCLC over chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. MPR was significantly associated with both prolonged DFS and OS, manifesting its potential as an essential endpoint for future neoadjuvant trials.",

In this paper, we describe the clinical characteristics and treatment experiences of people living with EGFR-m lung cancer from Project PRIORITY, a patient-driven study. An online survey was distributed among the EGFR Resisters community between April 2019 and January 2020. The survey captured participants' demographics and lung cancer risk factors, diagnostic and treatment pathways, and prevalence of side effects. Descriptive statistics were used and included subgroups based on residency and cancer stage. Of the 425 participants, most were female (67%), under 60 years old (53%), and resided in the United States (74%). The most frequently reported symptom at diagnosis was cough (54%), though 18% reported no symptoms. In addition, 89% reported receiving at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); osimertinib was the most prescribed first-line TKI for stage IV participants diagnosed after 2017. Participants residing in the United States were more likely to have access to advanced diagnostic (next-generating sequencing) and newer treatments such as osimertinib. Just under half of the sample (47%) had experienced progressive disease and were no longer on first-line treatment. The TKI era has been practice changing; however, little is understood from the perspective of people living with EGFR-m NSCLC. This paper is the first to explore this and found it is possible to have people self-report complex health information about their lung cancer. In addition, although most participants were diagnosed after osimertinib became guideline-recommended treatment, disparities in treatment were identified.",

    "abstract": "The front-line treatment options and regulatory approval scenario for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have rapidly evolved in the recent months, with newly presented positive trial results of novel compounds and combination strategies in the setting of common activating mutations, uncommon mutations, and exon 20 insertions. In this context, international lively debate is emerging on how to choose among the available regimens, based on efficacy and safety results. A virtual International Expert Panel was held in July 2024 to review data on front-line regimens in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, including common, uncommon and exon 20 insertions. The panel discussed available evidence, and reached common considerations for clinical practice and clinical research. In the setting of EGFR common activating mutations, all panelists agreed that single agent osimertinib, the combination of osimertinib with platinum-pemetrexed, and the combination of amivantamab and lazertinib, are first-line treatment options. Overall, panelists defined characteristics of patients in which combination treatments should be avoided. Subsequent treatment strategies at disease progression were discussed according to the different front-line options. With regards to uncommon EGFR mutations, panelists agreed that afatinib remains the only drug with phase 3 results available, and that afatinib and osimertinib are the preferred first-line options. In EGFR exon20 insertion positive disease, the combination of carboplatin, pemetrexed and amivantamab has been identified as the preferred front-line treatment, with second-line amivantamab to be used in the second-line setting whenever not available in front-line. The panelists defined priorities in clinical research, with high priority attributed to investigating resistance mechanisms, novel generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and selection biomarkers. Different toxicity profiles and sequential strategies were considered, together with efficacy results, to reach common considerations for the front-line treatment strategies in EGFR mutant NSCLC, however clinical research should be prioritized to identify further selection features.",

    "title": "Concurrent TP53 Mutations Facilitate Resistance Evolution in EGFR Exon 20 S768I Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are the most common driver genes in the development of cancer (NSCLC). Among them, mutations in exons 18-21 are the most frequent, especially the deletion of exons 19 and 21, where L858R mutations are the most common. Other mutations such as S768I, G719X, and 20ins are relatively rare. In the population of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations, some common mutations may occur, especially TP53. Here, this study presents a retrospective analysis of neoadjuvant therapy for lung adenocarcinoma and reviews relevant literature. The patient was diagnosed with T4N3M1a, stage IVa. After 1 month of chemotherapy with 860 mg of pemetrexed and 480 mg of carboplatin, and immunotherapy with 200 mg of sintilimab, good response to conventional chemotherapy, but a follow-up CT scan showed disease progression. Next-generation sequencing showed EGFR exon 20 missense mutation (p.S768I and p.V774M) combined with tumor protein p53 (TP53) (p.Y220C) missense mutation, with mutation abundance of 48.6%/49.7% and 49.2%, respectively. Subsequently, chemotherapy with paclitaxel albumin 400 mg and treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg were administered, followed by targeted treatment with oral afatinib (PFS: 12 months). And then, brain metastasis occurred, and targeted treatment with osimertinib was used instead (PFS: 9 months). The therapeutic effect is significant, but due to severe side effects, the patient stopped taking the medication on their own. Five months later, the patient became seriously ill again and CEA levels increased. Targeted treatment with furmonertinib (PFS: 3 months) and sunvozertinib (PFS: 3 months) was used instead. Three months later, the blood CEA level briefly decreased and then continued to increase, indicating the patient's critical condition. The results indicate that targeted therapy with afatinib and osimertinib for EGFR S7688I/V774M and TP53 mutations has better PFS than targeted therapy with furmonertinib and sunvozertinib. Simultaneously, the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be a potential neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC IVa stage patients.",

    "abstract": "Adjuvant osimertinib administered over a 3-year period in patients diagnosed with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has not only shown improvement in event-free survival but also demonstrated a prolonged overall survival (OS), leading to its approval as a standard treatment in this context. Meanwhile, no targeted studies have been conducted on the efficacy of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors in these patients. Although studies such as IMPOWER-010 and KEYNOTE-091 have included a small number of patients with positive driver genes, no definitive conclusions regarding the OS benefit have been established. Neoadjuvant targeted therapy is not currently recommended because of insufficient evidence, characterized by a low depth of pathological response and no reported improvement in survival outcomes. The same is true for neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations. Although numerous issues such as refining patient population selection, determining appropriate combination therapy regimens, establishing primary endpoints, assessing the influence of perioperative complications, and accurately evaluating the clinical application of circulating tumor DNA in various scenarios exist, several promising ongoing trials, including ADAURA2 and NEOADURA, are expected to provide valuable insights that will help address these questions. Here, we summarize the available evidence and clinical issues that need to be considered to optimize clinical decision-making for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance to osimertinib (Osi) remains a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). AXL elevation is a known key mechanism of Osi-resistance, and therapeutic strategies remain scarce. Emerging evidence reveals that an increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) level induces Osi resistance. In this study, a new mechanism is identified by which GSH regulates AXL expression via glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in Osi-resistant cells. A multifunctional covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatform for GSH consumption, AXL inhibition, and co-delivery of the AXL inhibitor (Brigatinib) and Osi is creatively constructed to confirm whether Osi sensitivity improves by simultaneously targeting GSH-AXL resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, it is coated, for the first time, the COF carrier system with specific vesicles to precisely home it into resistant tumors, where CDH2 adhesion molecules play a crucial role. The engineered multifunctional antiresistance-specific nanovesicles effectively inhibited the GSH-AXL axis, induced apoptosis in Osi-resistant cells both in vitro and in vivo, and delayed the progression of Osi-resistant tumors. Overall, these findings provide a novel strategy to overcome the Osi-acquired resistance caused by high AXL levels in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, lung cancer stands as a leading cause of mortality, with EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for a large percentage of cases in the Indian population. Different generations of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are available to treat EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The purpose of our research was to evaluate and compare the superiority of osimertinib over gefitinib/erlotinib in terms of clinical effectiveness and safety. A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Clinical Oncology Center in the Western region of India. Patients suffering from EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC were recruited for the study. The response of EGFR-TKIs was assessed using objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of adverse events (AE). A total of 75 patients treated with EGFR TKIs were enrolled in the study. The ORR of osimertinib and gefitinib/erlotinib was 11.11% and 25.64% (p\u2009=\u20090.142) and DCR was found to be 69.44% and 82.05% (p\u2009=\u20090.28) respectively. Osimertinib and gefitinib/erlotinib had respective median PFS of 8.43 and 10.68 months. The incidence of AE of osimertinib and gefitinib/erlotinib was 1.94 and 2.49 respectively. Osimertinib was not found to be superior over gefitinib/erlotinib based on clinical effectiveness. Though it showed a better safety profile, the cost of the treatment of osimertinib over gefitinib/erlotinib was not justifiable.",

    "abstract": "Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are the first-line treatment of choice for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients treated with these inhibitors eventually develop resistance. One of the most common mechanisms is the emergence of the EGFR C797S mutation. Whether first-generation EGFR inhibitors (e.g. icotinib or gefitinib) can sustainably control EGFR-sensitive mutations/C797S NSCLC following third-generation EGFR inhibitor treatment remains insufficiently reported. Our case report discusses a female patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma carrying an EGFR exon 19 E746_A750delELREA mutation who received almonertinib as first-line treatment and developed C797S resistance during therapy. The patient was subsequently treated with a double dose of icotinib for 8\u2005months until disease progression occurred, along with the development of an EGFR exon 20 T790M point mutation and TP53 mutation. This case provides clinical evidence suggesting that first-generation EGFR-TKIs may be an effective treatment strategy for patients with acquired EGFR 19del/C797S resistance following EGFR TKI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest a potential link between interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and EGFR-TKI use, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) possibly affecting EGFR-TKI-associated ILD differently. Our objective is to use the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to explore the potential link between ILD and the combination of PPIs and EGFR-TKI. A retrospective examination of adverse event reports in the FAERS database spanning from the initial quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2023 was conducted. Disproportionality analysis, generalized linear models, and adjusted multivariable logistic regression were employed to assess the occurrence of EGFR-TKI-associated ILD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving PPIs compared to those not receiving PPIs. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) for PPIs combined with EGFR-TKIs demonstrated statistical significance (ROR 1.84, 95% CI 1.54-2.19). Significant increases were noted in both additive and multiplicative models (p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as in the adjusted odds ratios derived from multivariate analysis (1.77, 95% CI 1.42-2.19, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Stratified analysis reveals that the combination of lansoprazole or esomeprazole and EGFR-TKI was linked to an elevated risk of ILD, with a ROR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.84-3.04) and 2.90 (95% CI 2.11-3.98), respectively, surpassing the risk associated with either medication used independently. Similarly, the ROR for osimertinib or gefitinib combined with PPIs stands at 2.20 (95% CI 1.83-2.66) and 2.33 (1.35-4.02), respectively, exceeding the risk when either drug is used alone. Our study uncovered a heightened risk of ILD in NSCLC patients receiving certain EGFR-TKI in conjunction with specific PPIs, as opposed to EGFR-TKI monotherapy. Subsequent analysis indicates that different PPIs may elicit divergent effects on EGFR-TKI-associated ILD, with different EGFR-TKIs exhibiting distinct responses to combinations with different PPIs. Therefore, NSCLC patients undergoing such treatments should be meticulously monitored for ILD.",

    "abstract": "This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to identify the most effective first-line intervention (FLI) for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients with varying brain metastasis (BM) status. Data were collected from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), either alone or in combination, for EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC (EMAN) patients. The sources included EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and relevant conference abstracts from inception until December 2023. A total of 37 RCTs, encompassing 24 intervention options, were included in the NMA. Osimertinib combined with chemotherapy (CT) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to aumolertinib (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.93), furmonertinib (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98), lazertinib (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98), osimertinib alone (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.80), osimertinib + bevacizumab (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.00), befotertinib (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.90), and zorifertinib (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.93). Further, amivantamab + lazertinib showed slightly better PFS compared to aumolertinib, furmonertinib, zorifertinib, and osimertinib + bevacizumab (HR <1, but P >0.05). Regarding overall survival (OS), amivantamab + lazertinib demonstrated superior results relative to furmonertinib (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95) and befotertinib (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77). No significant OS differences were observed among osimertinib, osimertinib + bevacizumab, osimertinib + CT, lazertinib, and amivantamab + lazertinib. In BM patients, osimertinib + CT significantly enhanced PFS compared to osimertinib (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.66), furmonertinib (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90), befotertinib (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21-1.00), and zorifertinib (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.89). However, no noticeable PFS differences were observed between osimertinib + CT and amivantamab + lazertinib or aumolertinib. Lastly, osimertinib + CT and zorifertinib were associated with higher rates of all-grade adverse events (AEs) and grade \u22653 AEs, respectively. In EMAN patients, osimertinib + CT and amivantamab + lazertinib were associated with optimal PFS and OS, respectively. Among BM patients, osimertinib + CT offered the best PFS benefits. These findings may assist in clinical decision-making and personalized care for EMAN and BM patients. The study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024506995).",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations present in a substantial proportion of patients. Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI), exemplified by osimertinib, have dramatically improved outcomes by effectively targeting the T790M mutation-a primary driver of acquired resistance to earlier-generation EGFR TKI. Despite these successes, resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs inevitably emerges. Mechanisms include on-target mutations such as C797S, activation of alternative pathways like MET amplification, histologic transformations, and intricate tumor microenvironment (TME) alterations. These resistance pathways are compounded by challenges in tolerability, adverse events, and tumor heterogeneity. In light of these hurdles, this review examines the evolving landscape of combination therapies designed to enhance or prolong the effectiveness of third-generation EGFR TKIs. We explore key strategies that pair osimertinib with radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other molecularly targeted drugs, and we discuss the biological rationale, preclinical evidence, and clinical trial data supporting these approaches. Emphasis is placed on how these combinations may circumvent diverse resistance mechanisms, improve survival, and maintain a favorable safety profile. By integrating the latest findings, this review aims to guide clinicians and researchers toward more individualized and durable treatment options, ultimately enhancing both survival and quality of life for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "EGFR is frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer, and EGFR plays a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. Currently, drug resistance often develops following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. Therefore, It is essential to investigate new compounds that can effectively target EGFR overexpression. The polyphenols epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), found in tea, have demonstrated anti-cancer properties. In this study, we linked EGCG and erlotinib through a click reaction using polyglycol to form an EGCG-erlotinib conjugated compounds (EGCG-Erls). We then explored its biological activity through various experiments. The results indicated that the compound 10 exhibited a superior inhibitory effect on NCI-H1975 cells, reduced their cloning and migratory capabilities, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell cycle progression. Furthermore, it was observed that compound 10 can bind to the EGFR protein and effectively inhibit the expression of phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) and its downstream signaling proteins. Overall, the study suggests that compound 10 may induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation via the EGFR signaling pathway, providing a promising avenue for the development of new EGFR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer, it is not fully understood whether the longitudinal recurrence risk differs by the types of adjuvant treatment in EGFR-mutated patients. Individual data from two phase 3 trials (JIPANG and IMPACT) were collected and patients were categorized into three groups (A [EGFR wild-type, chemotherapy: n\u00a0=\u00a0299], B [EGFR mutant, chemotherapy: n\u00a0=\u00a0211], and C [EGFR mutant, gefitinib: n\u00a0=\u00a0116]). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. The longitudinal recurrence risk was analyzed by estimating hazard function among the groups. Median follow-up time was 69.3\u00a0months. Median DFS in groups A, B, and C were 42.2, 30.3, and 35.9\u00a0months, respectively. As referring to group A, the adjusted HR was 1.00 (95\u00a0%CI: 0.74-1.34) with group B, and 1.16 (95\u00a0%CI: 0.83-1.61) with group C. In the longitudinal recurrence risk analysis, groups A and B had a higher hazard level than group C for the first two years. However, they gradually decreased and reached a plateau, whereas group C sustained a similar recurrence risk even after gefitinib. As a result, DFS rates at 8\u00a0years in groups A, B, and C were 40.4\u00a0%, 33.9\u00a0%, and 22.3\u00a0%, respectively. Longitudinal recurrence risk with chemotherapy did not differ regardless of EGFR mutation status, whereas gefitinib showed a sustained recurrence risk after completion.

    "title": "Investigating osimertinib plus chemotherapy in EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Worldwide, 15-40% of advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have an activating EGFR mutation, treatable with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as osimertinib, recommended as front-line therapy. Despite the efficacy of first-line osimertinib, most patients will experience disease progression. Therefore, combining it with chemotherapy has become an area of interest. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-TKI that has extended survival in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation. However, resistance eventually leads to treatment failure. This has driven the advancement of strategies to overcome resistance to osimertinib. In this setting, the FLAURA2 trial yielded positive results by combining osimertinib with chemotherapy. Additionally, a range of other approaches, including the use of bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates alongside third-generation EGFR-TKIs or chemotherapy, support the development of novel therapeutic combinations, some of which have already been approved for EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. Next to osimertinib monotherapy, expanded upfront treatment options for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC require patient selection considering disease extent, toxicity and tolerability, dosing schedule and what the patient can expect through shared decision-making. Further studies are needed to identify the patients who will benefit the most from combination therapies and to sequence the new drugs into the treatment algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are common among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy beyond osimertinib progression may minimize CNS progression. In this retrospective analysis, patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive NSCLC and brain metastases who received platinum-based chemotherapy (PbChT) after disease progression on osimertinib were enrolled. The primary endpoint was real-world CNS progression-free survival (rwCNS-PFS) between patients who received PbChT with and without osimertinib continuation. Secondary endpoints included competing risk analysis of CNS progression and incidence of salvage radiotherapy to brain. A total of 101 patients were analyzed, out of which, 39 (39%) continued osimertinib with chemotherapy (OSI+ cohort) and 62 (61%) received chemotherapy alone (OSI- cohort). Median rwCNS-PFS was significantly longer in the OSI+ cohort (9.0 months, 95% CI 6.6-11.4) than the OSI- cohort (5.7 months, 95% CI 4.6-6.9) (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.76, P = .007). This remained significant after adjustment for EGFR mutation, line of osimertinib treatment, prior radiotherapy to brain, and CNS progression on osimertinib monotherapy. Estimated probability of CNS progression at 6 months was 5.6% in OSI+ cohort versus 20.9% in OSI- cohort. Incidence of salvage radiotherapy to brain was lower in the OSI+ cohort (15%) compared to OSI- cohort (24%). In patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC and brain metastases, continuing osimertinib with chemotherapy after progression on osimertinib significantly reduced risk of CNS progression. Prospective studies are warranted to define the optimal treatment strategy for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "This phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of TY-9591 (asandeutertinib), a deuterated osimertinib derivative. Patients with advanced EGFR-mutated (most commonly exon 19 deletions or L858R) NSCLC were enrolled. In the dose-escalation phase, TY-9591 was administered from 20 to 200 mg once daily to assess dose-limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose. In the dose-expansion phase, patients were treated with 80, 120, or 160 mg doses to further evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy. A total of 105 patients were enrolled (dose-escalation: n\u00a0= 19; dose-expansion: n\u00a0= 86). During the dose escalation phase, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 100 patients (95.2%). The most common TRAEs were decreased white blood cell count (54.3%), decreased neutrophil count (46.7%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (39.0%), and anemia (39.0%). Of these patients, 32 (30.5%) experienced grade 3 or higher TRAEs. Pharmacokinetic analysis found that TY-9591 had a favorable profile with reduced levels of active metabolites. During the dose-expansion phase (n\u00a0= 79), the median progression-free survival for first-line EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletions or L858R) NSCLC was 21.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.3-27.3), whereas the confirmed objective response rate was 85.9% (95% CI: 76.2-92.7). In patients with L858R mutations (n\u00a0= 36), the median progression-free survival was 19.3 months (95% CI: 13.1-23.5), and the confirmed objective response rate was 86.1% (95% CI: 70.5-95.3). TY-9591 reported a favorable safety profile and substantial efficacy in treating EGFR-mutated NSCLC, particularly in patients with L858R mutations.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R/T790\u00a0M mutation-mediated gefitinib resistance (GR) is a frequent dilemma in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to explore the effect of jatrorrhizine on treating GR NSCLC and its possible mechanism of action. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis detection were used to study the effect of jatrorrhizine on suppressing H1975 cells. Swiss Target Prediction and Traditional Chinese Medicine Database, GeneCards, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases and molecular docking were carried out to explore the targets of jatrorrhizine. Western blot was conducted to detect the effect of jatrorrhizine on inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Jatrorrhizine has a similar anti-tumor effect on inhibiting the proliferation and migration of H1975 cells. Jatrorrhizine could dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation, and invasion and promote the apoptosis of human NSCLC cells. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was preliminarily predicted (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and verified (Molecular docking) to be a critical pathway of jatrorrhizine against NSCLC. The cytotoxic assay of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PKI-402 on H1975 cells and ADP-Glo Kinase assay of the inhibitory effect of jatrorrhizine on PI3K kinase activity. Western blot verified that jatrorrhizine down-regulates the phosphorylation of PI3K/mTOR in H1975 cells. Our results revealed that jatrorrhizine is a potentially novel compound that inhibits GR NSCLC by inhibiting PI3K/mTOR phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Dacomitinib demonstrated superior survival benefit compared to gefitinib as a first-line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with common EGFR mutations through ARCHER 1050. However, there is limited real-world data concerning its efficacy and safety. This study included patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received dacomitinib as a first-line treatment between January 2021 and December 2022 at Samsung Medical Center and St. Vincent's Hospital. This study assessed the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety profile of dacomitinib, and subsequent treatments after dacomitinib failure. In total, 153 patients were included in this study. Exon 19 deletion was observed in 50.3% of patients, while the L858R mutation in exon 21 was observed in 46.4% of patients. 45.1% of patients had brain metastasis. The ORR was 84.3%. The median follow-up duration was 16.9 months, with a median PFS of 16.7 months (95% CI, 14.4 to 25.2). Based on the type of EGFR mutation, the median PFS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 14.5 to NE) in patients with exon 19 deletion, and 15.9 months (95% CI, 12.5 to NE) in patients with L858R mutation. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 7.2% of patients. Initially administered at a dose of 45\u00a0mg, dose reduction was necessary for 85.6% of patients, with a final dosage of 30\u00a0mg in 49.0% and 15\u00a0mg in 36.6% of cases. Out of the 60 patients who experienced disease progression, 31 underwent tissue re-biopsy and 25 underwent liquid biopsy. Overall, T790M mutation was detected in 40.9% of patients who progressed after dacomitinib. The survival benefit of dacomitinib has been demonstrated, indicating its promising efficacy in a real-world setting. The detection rate of the T790M mutation after dacomitinib treatment failure was comparable to that of other second-generation EGFR-TKIs.",

This multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 study (REZOR) included eligible patients from 50 hospitals across China. Those who had been histologically or cytologically confirmed as having NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 Leu858Arg mutation by central laboratory were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once daily either rezivertinib 180 mg or gefitinib 250 mg, until unacceptable toxicity occurred, disease progression, or other treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Each cycle lasted for 21 days. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival evaluated by masked independent central review (MICR) in the intention-to-treat set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03866499 and follow-up is ongoing. Between July 15, 2019, and Feb 14, 2022, 695\u2008patients were screened. Among them, 369 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either rezivertinib 180 mg/day plus placebo (n=184) or gefitinib 250 mg/day plus placebo (n=185) in a 1:1 ratio; all of eligible participants were included in the intention-to-treat set. Median MICR-assessed progression-free survival was 19\u00b73 months (95% CI 13\u00b78-22\u00b71) in the rezivertinib group and 9\u00b76 months (8\u00b74-11\u00b73) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b736-0\u00b763; p<0\u00b70001) and the prespecified subgroup efficacy analysis showed consistent results. Median duration of exposure was 16\u00b70 months (95% CI 0\u00b70-29\u00b77) in the rezivertinib group and 11\u00b70 months (0\u00b70-28\u00b79) in the gefitinib group. Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events (82 [45%] of 184 in the rezivertinib group; 80 [43%] of 185 in the gefitinib group) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs; 43 [23%] of 184 in the rezivertinib group; 43 [23%] of 185 in the gefitinib group) were similar in both groups. One patient died from a TRAE in the rezivertinib group, due to pneumonia and interstitial lung disease. Our findings suggested that rezivertinib is a potential choice for patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC as first-line therapy, owing to the superior overall efficacy and subgroup progression-free survival compared with gefitinib in targeted patients.

Efficacy did not seem influenced even if radiation field was re-planed in response to the effect of gefitinib induction. As for late adverse events, pulmonary fibrosis occurred in 7 patients (35%). The median time from completion of CRT to the occurrence of the event was 245\u00a0days. All were grade 1, and there was no evidence of cavitation of the lesions or chronic infections such as Aspergillus infection during the course of the disease. One case of small cell lung cancer occurred during the period. With longer follow-up time, we demonstrated favorable efficacy with tolerable toxicity profiles in the EGFR-TKI induction followed by standard CRT in EGFR-mutant, stage III, NSCLC.

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon20ins mutations are resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Amivantamab utilizes multiple mechanisms of action to bypass the altered binding site conformation and recruits immune cells for anti-cancer activity. Amivantamab is approved in the frontline setting of EGFR exon20ins-mutated NSCLC in combination with carboplatin plus pemetrexed. Single-agent amivantamab is approved in second line or later\u00a0for EGFR\u00a0exon20ins. Furthermore, amivantamab with lazertinib for first line as well as amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for second line after osimertinib have both been approved in the treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations. Now with multiple indications, we must learn how to manage the unique side effects of amivantamab to maximize treatment benefit for the patients. Side effects of amivantamab can be associated with inhibition of the EGFR and/or mesenchymal epithelial transcription factor (MET) signaling pathways. This work reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacology, clinical trial data, and covers management of toxicities. This guide is designed as a practical reference tool for clinicians, pharmacists, and basic science researchers.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a predominant histological subtype of lung cancer, characterized by high incidence and mortality rates. Despite significant advancements in therapeutic strategies and a deeper understanding of targeted therapies in recent years, tumor resistance remains an inevitable challenge, leading to poor prognostic outcomes. Several studies have indicated that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) plays a regulatory role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, and its elevated expression may be associated with resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Furthermore, the catalytic product of SPHK1, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), along with its receptor, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), plays a regulatory role in the function of the EGFR. However, the specific effects of the SPHK1/S1P/S1PR3 axis on EGFR in NSCLC, as well as the combined effects of SPHK1/S1P/S1PR3 inhibitors with the EGFR-TKI gefitinib, remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between SPHK1 expression levels and the survival rates of NSCLC patients, the relationship between SPHK1 or S1PR3 and EGFR, and the impact of SPHK1 expression on the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) affects 10-50% of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that radically changes the outcome of patients with tumors bearing EGFR sensitizing or EGFR T790M resistance mutations. However, resistance usually occurs, and new therapeutic combinations need to be explored. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model is ideal for studying aggressive tumor growth and the responses to complex therapeutic combinations due to its vascularization and complex microenvironment. This study aims to demonstrate the relevance of analyzing a complex therapeutic response to osimertinib treatment, especially through advanced transcriptomic analysis with the CAM model, which has been limited thus far. We engrafted HCC827 cells (EGFR p.E746_A750del) into the CAM model and treated them with various osimertinib doses for 7\u2009days. The study involved supervised multivariate discrimination and ontology analysis of human transcriptional data. We found that CDX tumor growth inversely correlated with osimertinib dosage, with a notable 35% tumor weight reduction at 10\u2009\u03bcm. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that osimertinib reduces EGFR pathway activity and its effectors, and dampens chemotaxis, immune recruitment and angiogenesis, indicating that effectiveness extends beyond cellular mechanisms to the tissue level. This was supported by a 15% reduction in blood vessels around the xenograft in osimertinib-treated cases. This study is the first to demonstrate that ontological analysis of transcriptomic data in the CAM model aligns with clinical observations, highlighting the relevance of this methodology for understanding and ameliorating the efficacy of targeted therapy in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Several head-to-head meta-analyses have compared the efficacy and safety of different first-line treatments in patients with EGFR mutation-positive (M+) advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsq-NSCLC). However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation encompassing multiple treatment strategies. Our objective is to conduct a network meta-analysis that includes various treatment modalities, enabling both direct and indirect comparisons for a more thorough assessment. We conducted a search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception until May 8, 2024, to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR) and grade 3 or higher adverse events (\u22653AEs). Stata 15.0 and R 4.3.2 software were utilized for the network meta-analysis. A total of 30 RCTs, comprising 8654 participants, were included. The study encompassed the following 19 treatments: Chemotherapy; Afatinib; Afatinib + Cetuximab; Apatinib + Gefitinib; Befotertinib; Cetuximab + Chemotherapy; Erlotinib; Erlotinib + Bevacizumab; Erlotinib + Chemotherapy; Gefitinib; Gefitinib + Chemotherapy; Gefitinib + Olaparib; Icotinib; Icotinib + Chemotherapy; Lazertinib; Naquotinib; Osimertinib; Osimertinib + Bevacizumab; Osimertinib + Chemotherapy. The network meta-analysis results indicated that, in terms of PFS, Osimertinib + Chemotherapy (SUCRAs: 93.4%) and Osimertinib (SUCRAs: 84.61%) were the most effective. Regarding OS, Lazertinib (SUCRAs: 89.72%), Gefitinib (SUCRAs: 72.07%), and Osimertinib + Chemotherapy (SUCRAs: 70.74%) emerged as the top three options. Afatinib (SUCRAs: 92.27%) was associated with the best ORR improvement. For \u22653AEs, Afatinib (SUCRAs: 74.93%) and Osimertinib (SUCRAs: 69.42%) were likely the best choices. Current evidence suggests that, considering both survival and safety, Osimertinib stands out as the preferred first-line treatment for untreated EGFR M + advanced or metastatic nsq-NSCLC. Notably, the combination of Osimertinib with chemotherapy demonstrated superior survival benefits. However, due to the limitations in the number and quality of included studies, these conclusions await further validation through more high-quality research. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024562981, identifier CRD42024562981.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules targeting activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are efficacious anticancer agents, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among these, lazertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has recently gained FDA approval for use in combination with amivantamab, a dual EGFR/MET-targeting monoclonal antibody. This review delves into the discovery and development of lazertinib underscoring the improvements in medicinal chemistry properties, especially in comparison with osimertinib. Analysis of its structure-activity relationships (SAR), as outlined in the patent literature, reveals the structural diversity explored enroute to the candidate molecule. The resulting structure of lazertinib is distinguished among other TKIs due to the combination of the hydrophobic phenyl and hydrophilic amine substituents on the pyrazole. The structural basis for the selectivity against the T790M mutation is enabled by the substituted pyrazole moiety, which facilitates both van der Waals and H-bonding interactions with the EGFR kinase domain. Insights from this case study offer lessons that can inform the future design of kinase inhibitors with improved safety and efficacy profiles for cancer treatment and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Signaling pathways centered on the G-protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) and its downstream effector ArfGAP with the SH3 Domain, Ankyrin Repeat and PH Domain 1 (AMAP1) drive cancer invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance. The Arf6-AMAP1 pathway has been reported to promote receptor recycling leading to programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpression in pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Moreover, AMAP1 regulates of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which is an important molecule in inflammation and immune activation, including tumor immune interaction through PD-L1 regulation. In this study, we investigated the function of AMAP1 on PD-L1 expression using lung cancer cells. We used two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting. AMAP1 and NF-kB expression were reduced by conventional siRNA methods, and osimertinib was used as an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Multiple analysis of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) was conducted using a semi-comprehensive RTKs assay. We found that AMAP1 inversely regulated PD-L1 expression. Based on these results, we examined the activation levels of RTKs associated with both AMAP1 and PD-L1. Following a semi-comprehensive phosphorylated RTK assay, we observed the upregulation of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) led by the downregulation of AMAP1. The inhibition of pEGFR by osimertinib downregulates PD-L1 expression. We investigated the relationships between AMAP1, NF-\u03baB, and PD-L1 expression. AMAP1 knockdown upregulated the expression of both NF-\u03baB and PD-L1. Subsequently, NF-\u03baB knockdown downregulated PD-L1 levels, while double knockdown of AMAP1 and NF-\u03baB, restored PD-L1 expression. AMAP1 may inversely regulate PD-L1 through negative feedback of pEGFR and activation of NF-\u03baB in NSCLC cell lines.",

This report examined the long-term follow-up data (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials: jRCTs2051190027) of the same patients, analyzing relevant biomarkers from tumor and plasma samples. The six patients enrolled in the RELAY-Brain trial received RAM plus ERL or osimertinib (OSM). Our long-term follow-up observational study assessed patient survival, treatment status, and genetic biomarkers. Tumor and plasma samples were analyzed at baseline, during treatment, and at disease progression using next-generation sequencing and droplet digital PCR, to identify gene alterations and EGFR-TKI-resistant mutations. After median follow-up of 44.2\u00a0months, the first site of disease progression in three of the patients was the brain metastases. In the RAM\u2009+\u2009ERL group, two patients with the T790M mutation subsequently received OSM. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival ranged from 10.46 to 42.07\u00a0months and from 30.14 to 52.25\u00a0months, respectively. Gene alterations included TP53 mutations in three patients and ERBB2 and PIK3CA mutations in two. TP53 mutations were associated with shorter PFS. RAM with ERL or OSM achieved significant clinical benefits for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with asymptomatic brain metastases.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer recurrence after complete surgical resection of early-stage T1-T2N0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a problem due to unrecognized micrometastatic disease. The objective of this review is to present and summarize data from major randomized trials in which have studied the survival benefit of adjuvant therapy for early-stage NSCLC. Information used to write this paper was collected from PubMed and the National Clinical Trial registry from the National Library of Medicine. Clinical trials that explored the use of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy historically have failed to show a benefit to giving adjuvant therapy in this early-stage patient population. Specifically, no survival benefit has been shown in stage IA (T1N0) tumors and stage IB tumors (T2aN0), less than 4 cm in size. As a result, adjuvant chemotherapy is currently recommended for only stage IB (pT2aN0) and IIA (pT2bN0) which are greater than 4 cm in size or have high-risk pathologic features. Newer and more effective treatments including targeted therapy against tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driver mutants, tumors with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and immunotherapy have renewed interest in exploring the role of adjuvant therapy among early-stage patients. Three years of adjuvant osimertinib with or without adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) in a trial population of IB-IIIA NSCLC patients and is approved for adjuvant use in EGFR mutant early-stage NSCLC. In the future, appropriate patient selection for adjuvant therapy, driven by molecular high-risk features, circulating tumor DNA, or blood-based biomarkers will be important as the majority of early-stage patients are cured with surgical resection alone.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been authorized for use in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant osimertinib in individuals with resectable locally advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation. Ten centers located in mainland China took part in a single-arm, real-world, multicenter retrospective study (registration number: ChiCTR2100049954). Enrollment included individuals with lung adenocarcinoma who had EGFR mutations. Following the administration of osimertinib, the patients underwent a surgical procedure for resection. The main endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The subsequent endpoint analyzed was the joint assessment of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). From July 31, 2018 to April 28, 2023, a total of 38 individuals were involved and received neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment. The ORR was 60.5% (23/38). Thirty-eight patients underwent surgery, and 36 (94.7%) underwent successful R0 resection. Out of 38 patients, sixteen (42.1%) experienced adverse events (AEs) due to treatment in the neoadjuvant phase, with none of them reaching grade 3. Skin irritation [14 (36.8%)], stomach upset [5 (13.2%)], mouth sores [1 (2.6%)] and increased liver enzyme levels [1 (2.6%)] were the common AEs of treatment. The follow-up period lasted an average of 24.9 months. The 1-year OS rate is 94.2%, while the 2-year OS rate is 89.2%. The 1-year DFS rate is 87.9%, and the 2-year DFS rate remains at 87.9%. In the actual clinical setting, osimertinib displays encouraging possibilities as a neoadjuvant therapy for individuals with operable EGFR-mutated NSCLC, exhibiting adequate efficacy and an acceptable safety record. The phase III clinical trial of NeoADAURA is expected to provide further efficacy and safety results.",

Among 1,288 patients who developed disease progression, we identified 14 patients who were treated with a triple therapy regimen of EGFR-TKI plus dabrafenib and trametinib due to newly acquired BRAF At the time of the data cutoff (August 1, 2024), the estimated median PFS was 6.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-not evaluated (NE)]. The median OS was not reached in 14 patients. ORR was 35.7% (95% CI: 14.0-64.4%) and DCR was 78.6% (95% CI: 52.4-92.4%). Three patients (21.4%) reported progressive disease (PD) and that was the best response. The median PFS was 8.35 months (95% CI: 2.0-NE) in 8 patients receiving third-generation TKI followed by first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and 6.9 months (95% CI: 2.5-NE) in 6 patients receiving third-generation TKI as first-line treatment directly. There was no significant difference in PFS between the two groups of patients receiving third-generation TKIs in different treatment sequences above [hazard ratio (HR): 1.107; 95% CI: 0.318-3.854; P=0.85]. Subgroup analysis indicated that a complex genetic mutation background may be a potential factor contributing to poorer PFS. No unexpected adverse effects were reported. Apart from pyrexia, gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions and skin-related adverse reactions warrant close attention.

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of co-administration of osimertinib and HAD-B1 using gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells, HCC827-GR. HAD-B1 is composed of 4 natural drugs, Panax Notoginseng Radix, Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, Cordyceps militaris, and Boswellia carterii Birdwood, and has been reported to have therapeutic effects on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in several studies. Resistance to gefitinib in HCC827 cells was acquired through MET activity. Co-treatment with osimertinib and HAD-B1 reduced the cell viability of HCC827-GR cells. In addition, phosphorylation of MET and ERK were effectively suppressed for HCC827-GR cells. And, compared to when osimertinib and HAD-B1 were administered alone, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and apoptosis was effectively induced when osimertinib and HAD-B1 were co-administered to HCC827-GR cells. We found that the synergistic effect of osimertinib and HAD-B1 combination therapy resulted in cancer cell death and cell cycle arrest by targeting the ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the combination of osimertinib, a third-generation anticancer drug, and HAD-B1, a natural anticancer drug, had a potentially synergistic effect on non-small cell lung cancer resistant to EGFR-targeted anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Spread of lung cancer to the leptomeninges is rare and difficult to treat. Standard therapy comprises CNS-penetrant targeted agents with or without intrathecal chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of 16 patients with advanced NSCLC and leptomeningeal disease treated with intrathecal pemetrexed 50 mg. All tumours were adenocarcinoma histology; 13 (81.3%) had EGFR mutations, and 3 (18.8%) had no targetable mutations. Prior therapies included EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with/without chemotherapy/antiangiogenic agents (9 [56.3%]), chemotherapy alone (4 [25%]), intrathecal methotrexate with/without hydrocortisone (3 [18.9%]), and radiation (12 [75%]). Presenting symptoms of leptomeningeal disease included headache (10 [62.5%]), dizziness (8 [50%]), and seizures (7 [43.8%]). Systemic therapy administered along with intrathecal pemetrexed included osimertinib (5 [31.3%]), gefitinib in 1 (6.3%), chemotherapy in 4 (25%) (pemetrexed + carboplatin-2, cisplatin + etoposide-1, paclitaxel-1), chemotherapy + oral TKI in 5 (31.3%) and no systemic therapy in 1 (6.3%). Neurological symptoms following intrathecal pemetrexed included headache in 1 (6.3%) patient which was likely due to raised intracranial pressure from underlying leptomeningeal disease, and anxiety/uneasiness in 1 (6.3%). Grade 3 or higher toxicities included thrombocytopenia (6 [37.5%]), anaemia (4 [25%]), neutropenia (4 [25%]), febrile neutropenia (3 [18.8%]), mucositis (4 [25%]), diarrhoea (1 [6.3%]), rash (1 [6.3%]) and hypokalemia (1 [6.3%]. Most toxicities were likely caused by systemic chemotherapy, rather than by intrathecal pemetrexed. Intrathecal pemetrexed was delayed in 9 (56.3%) patients, due to cytopenias/febrile neutropenia (8 [50%]) and poor general condition (1 [6.3%]). Median OS from diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease was 7.5 months (95% CI: 1.2-13.8). Median OS from start of intrathecal pemetrexed was 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.1-4.3). Thus, intrathecal pemetrexed combined with systemic antitumor therapy was tolerable, with promising clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC and leptomeningeal disease. It is important to explore this option, especially in driver mutation-negative NSCLC patients.",

The present study investigated the concomitant use of TCNs, TCSs, and DARDs with EGFR-TKIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and whether these affect patient outcomes. We retrospectively collected data from all patients (n = 1,498) who had purchased for EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib) in Finland between 2011 and 2020. Overall survival (OS) and time-on-treatment (ToT) were analyzed from the first EGFR-TKI purchase. Early TCN purchases were registered in 298 (19.6%) patients; early TCS and DARD purchases were observed in 154 (10.1%) and 192 (12.9%), while similar percentages were detected in the EGFR mutant cohort. In the entire cohort, early purchase of TCSs and TCNs was associated with improved ToT, OS, and DARDs with inferior outcomes. In the multivariate analysis, TCSs retained their significance in ToT (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66-0.94), TCNs in OS (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.63-0.84), and DARDs in both (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.091-1.495; HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01-1.41). In the EGFR mutant cohort, similar nonsignificant trends were observed for TCNs, TCSs and DARDs. In the analysis according to EGFR-TKI, erlotinib users had improved outcomes when early TCN or TCS purchases were registered, whereas DARDs were associated with worse outcomes among gefitinib users. Among EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLCs, the use of TCN, TCS, and DARD can affect treatment outcomes that should be considered in optimal patient care.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the standard first-line treatment for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, treatment resistance is inevitable and increased c-Met protein expression correlates with resistance. Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets c-Met protein overexpression. In this article, we report the results of a phase I/Ib trial evaluating Teliso-V plus osimertinib in patients with NSCLC after progression on osimertinib. This multicenter, open-label study (NCT02099058) enrolled patients with advanced EGFR-mutated, c-Met protein-overexpressing, non-squamous NSCLC that had progressed on prior osimertinib. Patients received Teliso-V (intravenously, every 2 weeks) plus osimertinib (orally, 80 mg once daily). Teliso-V was evaluated at 1.6 mg/kg in a safety lead-in phase and escalated to 1.9 mg/kg. Dose expansion included both doses. Endpoints included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 38 patients received Teliso-V (1.6 mg/kg, n\u00a0= 20; 1.9 mg/kg, n\u00a0= 18) plus osimertinib and were included in this analysis. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Most frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were peripheral sensory neuropathy (50%), peripheral edema (32%), and nausea (24%). Most common grade 3/4 TEAEs were anemia (11%) and pulmonary embolism (8%). Five TEAEs led to death; none were reported as being related to Teliso-V or osimertinib. The pharmacokinetic profile of Teliso-V plus osimertinib was similar to Teliso-V monotherapy. After a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the ORR was 50.0% per independent central review (ICR) (DOR not reached), and median PFS per ICR was 7.4 months (95% confidence interval 5.4 months-not reached). Teliso-V plus osimertinib had promising activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with c-Met protein-overexpressing, EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC after progression on osimertinib.

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) gene mutation is a large class of mutations commonly seen in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MET mutation includes subtypes such as MET exon 14 skipping mutation (METex14m) and MET amplification (METamp). For advanced NSCLC with METex14m, Savolitinib has a high sensitivity as a member of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METamp is a relatively rare genetic mutation type which can serve as a driver gene to mediate primary and later acquired drug resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKIs. For advanced NSCLC with secondary METamp, EGFR-TKIs combined with MET-TKIs are usually used in clinical treatment, while the optimal treatment strategy for advanced NSCLC with primary METamp has not yet been determined. For locally advanced NSCLC patients with positive driver gene mutations such as EGFR, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion and METex14m, there have been relevant cases reported that neoadjuvant targeted therapy could achieve a good prognosis, but there have been no cases of neoadjuvant targeted therapy for locally advanced NSCLC patients with METamp. This report describes a case of a locally advanced NSCLC patient with dual driver gene mutations (EGFR L858R combined with primary METamp), the tumor did not shrink after 1 month of Gefitinib monotherapy, but significantly subsided after 4 months of Savolitinib monotherapy. After radical surgery, the pathological results proved pathological complete response (pCR) of the tumor, and the patient had a good response to postoperative continual Savolitinib treatment, with no recurrence nor metastasis observed to date. This case reports the feasibility and effectiveness of neoadjuvant targeted therapy for locally advanced NSCLC with primary METamp, aiming to provide effective reference for perioperative treatment of locally advanced NSCLC with primary METamp.\u2029. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u8d5b\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\u8bf1\u5bfcMET\u6269\u589e\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u2029\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e31\u4f8b\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u95f4\u8d28-\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5316\u56e0\u5b50\uff08mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor, MET\uff09\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u662f\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u5305\u62ecMET\u5916\u663e\u5b5014\u8df3\u8dc3\u7a81\u53d8\uff08MET exon 14 skipping mutation, METex14m\uff09\u548cMET\u6269\u589e\uff08MET amplification, METamp\uff09\u7b49\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709METex14m\u7684\u665a\u671fNSCLC\uff0c\u8d5b\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\uff08Savolitinib\uff09\u8fd9\u79cd\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\uff08tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002METamp\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f83\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684NSCLC\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u56e0\u4ecb\u5bfc\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff08epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR\uff09-TKIs\u7684\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u8010\u836f\u548c\u540e\u671f\u836f\u7269\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u8010\u836f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eEGFR-TKIs\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027METamp\u7a81\u53d8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u591a\u91c7\u53d6\u5728EGFR-TKIs\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8054\u5408MET-TKIs\u8fdb\u884c\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u5bf9\u539f\u53d1\u6027METamp\u7a81\u53d8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u672a\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eEGFR\u3001\u95f4\u53d8\u6027\u6dcb\u5df4\u7624\u6fc0\u9176\uff08anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK\uff09\u878d\u5408\u3001METex14m\u7b49\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u9633\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u9884\u540e\u5df2\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u75c5\u4f8b\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u6709METamp\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u62a5\u9053\u4e861\u4f8b\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\uff08EGFR L858R\u5408\u5e76\u539f\u53d1METamp\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u75971\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u80bf\u7624\u672a\u89c1\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u66f4\u6362\u4e3a\u8d5b\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u75974\u4e2a\u6708\u8bf1\u5bfc\u540e\u80bf\u7624\u660e\u663e\u6d88\u9000\uff0c\u6839\u6cbb\u6027\u624b\u672f\u5207\u9664\u540e\u75c5\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u793a\u80bf\u7624\u83b7\u5f97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u672f\u540e\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u8d5b\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u672a\u89c1\u80bf\u7624\u590d\u53d1\u6216\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u62a5\u9053\u4e86\u539f\u53d1METamp\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\u884c\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u539f\u53d1METamp\u7a81\u53d8\u5c40\u90e8\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u7684\u56f4\u624b\u672f\u671f\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u501f\u9274\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u9776\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\uff1bMET\u6269\u589e\uff1b\u8d5b\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\uff1b\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u3011.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has revolutionized one of the standard most efficient treatments for EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is currently one of most efficient treatments in clinical practice. However, it has a potentially fatal side effect: interstitial lung disease (ILD). When severe ILD occurs, a drug substitution is often required, and there is a rising concern about which drug to choose to inhibit the progression of NSCLC and avoid aggravating while alleviating ILD. Herein, we report an NSCLC case with osimertinib-induced ILD successfully rechallenged by almonertinib. In addition, we conducted a literature review on the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of almonertinib, hoping to provide insight into NSCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "The impact of clinical stage on the effectiveness of osimertinib for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unexamined. We investigated osimertinib therapeutic efficacy variation between stage IVA or lower and stage IVB EGFR mutation-positive lung cancers, focusing on differences in pretreatment co-occurring genetic alterations in circulating tumor DNA. This was a secondary analysis of the ELUCIDATOR study, a multicenter prospective observational study in Japan that assessed the mechanisms underlying resistance to osimertinib as a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations. We compared the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pretreatment co-occurring genetic alterations detected in plasma between patients with stages IVA (n\u2009=\u200983) and IVB disease (n\u2009=\u200984). Multivariate analysis of PFS and OS revealed that stage IVB was associated with a poor prognosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-3.04, p\u2009<\u20090.001, HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.45-3.90, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Pre-osimertinib treatment, significantly more TP53- (52.4% vs. 27.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.002), EGFR amplification- (58.3% vs. 23.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and MET amplification-positive cases (22.6% vs. 7.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.008) were found among stage IVB than among stage IVA or lower cases. Patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC in stage IVB exhibited significantly shorter PFS and OS than those in earlier stages when treated with first-line osimertinib. The prevalence of baseline TP53 mutations, EGFR amplification, and MET amplification in plasma were significantly higher in stage IVB cases, implicating them in the worse outcomes of this group.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a widely used tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations. However, the correlation between dose and efficacy has been debated for several years. For this reason, there is a need for standardized methods for routine analysis, clinical studies on pharmacokinetics and dose-response relationships, and greater understanding of preanalytical conditions, such as sample storage stability. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of osimertinib and its two metabolites, AZ7550 and AZ5104, in human plasma and to investigate long-term storage stability of the analytes. Samples were prepared by protein precipitation and separated on a Kinetex EVO C18 column (2.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f150\u202fmm, 2.6\u202f\u00b5m). Electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring were used to monitor the ion transitions. The validated concentration ranges were from 1.25 to 3000\u202fng/mL. Interassay precisions and accuracies were all \u2264\u202f15\u202f%. Linearity, dilution integrity, and carry-over were also examined and satisfied the validation criteria. Stability was examined under different conditions, and the analytes were found to be stable for more than 3 years at -80\u00b0C (< 15\u202f% decline). Finally, the analytical method was successfully applied in a clinical setting on plasma samples from 30 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in treatment with osimertinib, demonstrating its suitability for use in clinical studies and its potential for therapeutic drug monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Combining radiotherapy with targeted therapy benefits patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (EGFRm NSCLC). However, the optimal strategy to combine EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with radiotherapy for maximum efficacy and minimal toxicity is still uncertain. Notably, EVs, which serve as communication mediators among tumor cells, play a crucial role in the anti-tumor immune response. Methods To exploit the role of EVs in the delivery of tumor antigens, we formulated a therapeutic strategy that involves the use of radiation-induced tumor-derived EVs (TEXs) loaded onto dendritic cells (DCs) as a kind of vaccine in conjunction with EGFR TKIs and assessed the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of EGFRm NSCLC. Results In our study, we characterized the release of immunogens as influenced by various modes of cell death, examining the impact of different levels of cell death under diverse irradiation modalities. Our results demonstrated that a radiation mode of 6Gy*3f exhibited the most promising potential to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. This radiotherapy fraction, combined with TKIs, showed promising results in a tumor-bearing mouse model with an EGFR mutation, although there is a risk of radiation-associated pneumonitis. Furthermore, we found that 6Gy*3f-TEXs in vitro activate DCs and promote T cell proliferation as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell destruction. The administration of EGFR-TKIs combined DCs loaded with 6Gy*3f-TEXs exhibited the potential to inhibit tumor growth and mitigate the risk of pneumonitis. Together, the research shows that TEXs from high-dose fractionation radiation can mature DCs and boost the killing of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Combining these DC vaccines with Osimertinib offers a promising and safe treatment for EGFRm NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a clinical challenge, due to the need for optimal local and systemic control. The management of unresectable Stage III NSCLC has evolved with advancements in radiation therapy (RT), systemic therapies, and immunotherapy. For patients with locally advanced NSCLC who are not surgical candidates, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has modest survival outcomes, due to both local progression and distant metastasis. Efforts to enhance outcomes have led to dose-escalation trials, advances in modern RT techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT), and the integration of adaptive RT to optimize target coverage while sparing organs at risk. Concurrent and consolidative immunotherapy, particularly with PD-L1 inhibitors, has shown promise, as evidenced by the PACIFIC trial, which demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with durvalumab following CRT. Ongoing trials are now investigating novel immunotherapy combinations and targeted therapies in this setting, including dual checkpoint inhibition, DNA repair inhibitors, and molecularly targeted agents like osimertinib for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Emerging biomarkers, such as circulating tumor DNA and radiomics, offer potential for personalizing treatment and predicting outcomes. Additionally, PBT and MR-guided adaptive RT have shown the potential to reduce toxicities while maintaining efficacy. Integrating these novel approaches may offer opportunities for optimizing treatment responses and minimizing adverse effects in this challenging patient population. Further investigation into patient stratification, biomarker-driven therapy, and refined therapeutic combinations is essential to improve long-term outcomes in unresectable Stage III NSCLC. This narrative review explores the current management strategies for unresectable Stage III NSCLC, from a radiation oncology perspective.",

Between September 2014 and March 2023, we enrolled advanced and recurrent T790M + NSCLC patients who had received osimertinib as sequential treatment for analysis. All patients had previously been treated with gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib as first-line therapy. A total of 158 patients who received osimertinib as sequential treatment were included in the final analysis. Of these, 99 patients (62.7%) received osimertinib as a 2nd-line treatment, while 59 patients (37.3%) were treated with osimertinib as \u22653rd-line therapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.7 months for the 2nd-line group and 8.9 months for the \u22653rd-line group. The median overall survival (OS) from first-line treatment was 73.2 months in the 2nd-line group and 57.5 months in the \u22653rd-line group. No statistically significant differences in PFS or OS were observed between the two groups. Our research demonstrated that osimertinib is effective not only as a 2nd-line therapy but also as a \u22653rd-line treatment, offering promising clinical benefits for advanced and recurrent EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with acquired T790M mutations who have developed resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib has emerged as the standard first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations, offering improved tolerability and demonstrating superior efficacy against brain metastases in comparison with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The Meckel's cave is a dural recess in the posteromedial part of the middle cranial fossa that acts as a conduit for the trigeminal nerve between the anterior pontine cisterna and the cavernous sinus, and houses the Gasserian ganglion and proximal radicle of the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal neuropathy, characterized by numbness and dysesthesia of the skin and mucous membranes of the face, poses diagnostic challenges and often requires differentiation from conditions, such as compression neuropathy, inflammation, and drug-induced reactions. Here, we report the case of Meckel's cave metastasis. She presented headache, anorexia, left facial numbness, and pain indicative of trigeminal neuropathy. Imaging revealed metastasis to Meckel's cave, consistent with her clinical symptoms. EGFR L858R mutation was detected by primary lesion of the lung DNA analysis. Treatment with osimertinib led to regression of the primary tumor and improvement of the trigeminal neuropathy within 3\u00a0months. Importantly, our review of the relevant literature identified only two similar cases with metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma to Meckel's cave. Ours was the only case in which symptom resolution was achieved. We underscore the utility of MRI and PET/CT studies in evaluating trigeminal-related symptoms and discuss imaging characteristics that may aid in their differentiation.",

However, its significance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) remains unclear. We retrospectively investigated the relationship between pre-treatment ALBI grade and hepatotoxicity and treatment efficacy in patients with NSCLC receiving EGFR-TKIs. We analyzed data from 182 patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs. Patients were categorized into ALBI grades 1/2a and 2b/3 groups. We examined the association between ALBI grade, hepatotoxicity, and time to treatment failure (TTF) using univariate and multivariate analyses. In the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, ALBI grade was not associated with hepatotoxicity (log-rank p=0.56). This finding was consistent with the multivariate analysis of patients treated with gefitinib and erlotinib (n=158). However, In the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median TTF for the ALBI grade 1/2a group was 10.6 months, compared to 5.8 months for the ALBI grade 2b/3 group (hazard ratio=1.66, 95% confidence interval=1.19-2.33, p=0.003). Multivariate analysis confirmed that ALBI grade 2b/3 (hazard ratio=1.64, 95% confidence interval=1.16-2.30, p<0.01) was independently associated with shortened TTF. Pretreatment ALBI grade classification can predict efficacy in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC who have EGFR mutations and favorable performance status (PS). Despite the increasing clinical data on osimertinib, evidence for its use in patients with impaired PS remains limited. Therefore, a multicenter phase II trial (OPEN/TORG2040) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line osimertinib treatment in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and a poor PS. Patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations and PS of 2 to 4 were enrolled. Osimertinib (80 mg once daily) was orally administered to eligible patients. The primary end point was objective response rate. The secondary end points were disease control rate, PS improvement rate, patient-reported outcomes, and safety. Between February 2021 and February 2022, 30 patients with poor PS (22 with a PS of 2, six with a PS of 3, and two with a PS of 4) were enrolled. The median age was 75 (range, 41-92) years, and 18 patients had brain metastases. The objective response rate was 63.3% (90% confidence interval, 46.7%-77.9%; one-sided, p = 0.033). Disease control and PS improvement rates were 93.3% and 63.3%, respectively. Global health status/QoL also improved. Median progression-free and overall survival were 8.0 and 25.4 months, respectively. Eight patients (26.7%) experienced serious adverse events leading to discontinuation, and six (20.0%) experienced interstitial lung disease. This prospective study confirmed the efficacy of first-line osimertinib treatment in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and poor PS, highlighting the need for interstitial lung disease risk management.

This study introduces an innovative approach utilizing folic acid-modified milk exosomes loaded with c-kit siRNA (FA-mExo-siRNA-c-kit) to target EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer. Initially, gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells exhibited stemness characteristics, including an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype and elevated ABCG2 expression, which were closely regulated by c-kit. Subsequent treatment with FA-mExo-siRNA-c-kit demonstrated effective suppression of c-kit expression and attenuation of stemness traits ",

However, the impact of acquired EGFR amplification on the efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKI against T790M remains uncertain. We aimed to investigate whether the presence of acquired EGFR amplification after first-generation EGFR-TKI resistance influences the efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We reviewed data from 275 advanced NSCLC patients harboring T790M after first-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of acquired EGFR amplification identified through next-generation sequencing (NGS) after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. We evaluated the efficacy of osimertinib used as a second-line treatment. Among these patients, 59 exhibited acquired EGFR amplification, while 216 did not. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.20 months in the EGFR amplification group and 12.03 months in the non-amplification group (p\u2009=\u20090.011), with median overall survival (OS) of 33.90 months and 23.30 months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.164). Multivariate analysis of PFS revealed that acquired EGFR amplification and EGFR 19del were independent prognostic factors for patients with T790M undergoing osimertinib. Additionally, subgroup analysis indicated a prolonged PFS in patients with EGFR 19del compared to those with EGFR 21L858R (p\u2009=\u20090.034) in the EGFR amplification group. Following first-generation EGFR-TKI resistance, advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients harboring both acquired T790M and EGFR amplification are likely to experience enhanced PFS with osimertinib. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy among individuals with EGFR 19del.",

The role of neoadjuvant osimertinib in the perioperative setting is yet to be elucidated in the NeoADAURA study (NCT04351555). This is a single-center, pilot study of patients with clinical stage IA to IIIA NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition) harboring an activating EGFR mutation (Exon 19 deletion, L858R) (NCT04816838). Patients were treated with two 28-day cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib followed by surgical resection and three years of adjuvant osimertinib. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate after two cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Secondary endpoints included the pathologic complete response rate and major pathologic response rate. Exploratory objectives included the correlation of longitudinal circulating tumor DNA testing (Signatera) and response to neoadjuvant osimertinib. A total of 25 patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib, and all patients received surgical resection with R0 resection. The objective response rate was 44% (n = 11) all of which were partial responses. Fourteen patients (56%) reported stable disease after neoadjuvant osimertinib. The major pathologic response and pathologic complete response rates were 24% (n = 6) and 0%, respectively. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median disease-free survival was not reached at a median follow-up of 31 months (range: 13.8-38.6 mo). Six patients (30%) were circulating tumor DNA-positive at baseline and achieved clearance after 1 cycle of neoadjuvant osimertinib. There were no grade 3 adverse events during neoadjuvant treatment. Two cycles of neoadjuvant osimertinib did not meet its primary endpoint of ORR. Neoadjuvant osimertinib is a feasible approach with a manageable safety profile in resectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR-activating mutations. However, resistance to TKI therapy often develops due to secondary EGFR mutations or the activation of bypass signalling pathways. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can efficiently identify actionable genetic alterations throughout treatment. MET amplification is a well-established off-target resistance mechanism. Additionally, rarer mechanisms, such as NTRK1 gene fusions, have been reported. This report highlights a case of a 58-year-old male diagnosed with bone-metastatic NSCLC harboring the EGFR L858R mutation. After receiving dacomitinib and almonertinib sequentially, plasma-based NGS revealed the emergence of EGFR T790M-trans-C797S mutations, prompting a switch to a combination therapy of almonertinib and gefitinib. Upon disease progression, repeat NGS identified EGFR T790M-cis&trans-C797S mutations and a novel POT1::NTRK3 fusion in the blood. The fusion retained a complete NTRK kinase domain without frameshift variants, making it a target for treatment. Larotrectinib was incorporated into the dual EGFR-TKI regimen, forming a triplet therapy. Although this resulted in grade 3 dermatitis, the condition resolved after discontinuing gefitinib. At multiorgan progression, matched tissue- and plasma-based NGS identified MET amplification. Subsequently, the patient was started on a triple-inhibition regimen targeting EGFR, NTRK, and MET, which achieved a partial response with favorable tolerability. This is the first reported case of a novel, targetable POT1::NTRK3 fusion as a potential off-target mechanism mediating EGFR-TKI resistance, occurring alongside MET amplification in a patient with NSCLC harboring acquired EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S mutations. Concomitant inhibition of EGFR, NTRK, and MET was safe and resulted in a significant response, underscoring the importance of precision medicine guided by matched NGS.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent mutations in tumor protein p53 (TP53) or Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-pathway components are linked to poor outcomes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the impact of triple mutations remains unclear. We report a case of EGFR-, TP53-, and Cullin 3 (CUL3)-mutant NSCLC in a 43-year-old woman with widespread metastases at diagnosis, including those in the contralateral lung, distant lymph nodes, pericardium, liver, bones, left adrenal gland, and brain. She received osimertinib as first-line therapy, but pericardial effusion and liver metastases progressed rapidly over 3 months, and she was switched to carboplatin and pemetrexed. By the eighth cycle of pemetrexed, the bone metastases had progressed, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to bone marrow carcinomatosis. The patient received third-line therapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel and fourth-line therapy with docetaxel, but further treatment was suspended owing to DIC progression. She passed away 23\u2009months after the initiation of osimertinib. Public database analysis revealed that the EGFR/TP53/CUL3 triple mutation accounts for 0.4% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cases, yielding significantly shorter survival than EGFR mutations alone and likely shorter than EGFR/TP53 double mutations. Gaining a deeper understanding of the clinical significance of coexisting genetic mutations in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC will be crucial to develop future therapies.",

    "abstract": "This Review discusses recent advancements in the development of fourth-generation \"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs)\" targeting resistance mutations, with an emphasis on the C797S mutation in \"Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\". While first, second, and third-generation EGFR-TKIs have made significant progress in overcoming EGFR kinase resistance, the emergence of the EGFR-C797S mutation poses a substantial challenge, particularly in the context of resistance to Osimertinib. Fourth-generation TKIs are classified into ATP-competitive, allosteric, and ortho-allosteric inhibitors, with the goal of enhancing specificity for mutant EGFR while minimizing off-target effects on wild-type EGFR to reduce toxicity. This Review provides a detailed analysis of structural modifications and their impact on drug potency and selectivity, with the aim of improving efficacy against resistant NSCLC. Preclinical and early-phase clinical trials of these inhibitors are promising, though further optimization of pharmacokinetic and safety profiles is crucial for future clinical success. This work offers key insights for medicinal chemists in the design and development of fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors to address drug-resistant mutations in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of diverse resistance mechanisms after osimertinib therapy, including on-target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and off-target alterations, warrants investigation of novel therapeutics to overcome these challenges and improve patient outcomes. COMPOSIT was a French, retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of the effectiveness and tolerability of osimertinib in combination with other targeted therapies in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbored other oncogenic drivers as primary or acquired resistance mechanisms. Real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) were the primary endpoints. The study included 61 patients (63.9% women; median age, 61 years). Chemotherapy was administered to 26 patients (42.6%) before the combinations. The most frequently targeted resistance mechanisms were MET amplification (n\u2005=\u200540) and BRAF alterations (n\u2005=\u200511). Sixteen combinations of osimertinib with other targeted therapies were reported. Overall (except for 10 patients in clinical trials), median rwPFS and OS were 3.9 (95% CI, 2.9-5.2) and 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.8-14.8). Best ORR (n\u2005=\u200554) was 50% (95% CI, 33.0-72.8). In patients with MET amplification (n\u2005=\u200529), median rwPFS and OS were 4.9 (95% CI, 2.9-7.2) and 8.6 months (95% CI, 5.3-21.6). Grade \u22653 adverse events occurred in 15 patients (24.6%). No deaths were related to treatment. Combinations of osimertinib with other targeted therapies appeared to be feasible and safe and may offer clinical benefit to overcome resistance to osimertinib in EGFRm NSCLC, especially in patients with MET amplification.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are standard treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations; however, drug resistance limits their efficacy. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) has been linked to cancer progression, but its role in EGFR-TKI resistance remains unclear. This study investigates the clinical relevance of CKAP4 as a therapeutic target to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. GEO datasets were analyzed to identify 24 differentially expressed genes associated with EGFR-TKI resistance, with CKAP4 selected via functional annotation and scoring using the VarElect tool. The prognostic significance of CKAP4 was evaluated using public databases, and its upregulation was confirmed in osimertinib-tolerant H1975 cells through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Integrated bioinformatics analysis identified CKAP4 as strongly associated with EGFR-TKI resistance. Elevated CKAP4 expression was particularly linked to poorer clinical outcomes in LUAD patients. Notably, osimertinib-tolerant cells exhibited high CKAP4 expression, correlating positively with increased half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of EGFR-TKIs. LUAD patients with upregulated CKAP4 showed significantly reduced overall and relapse-free survival. This study underscores the prognostic value of CKAP4 in EGFR-mutated LUAD and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target to counter EGFR-TKI resistance.",

Its real-world efficacy against uncommon EGFR mutations remains under-researched. The REIWA study, a multicentric, prospective, observational study conducted in Japan from September 2018 to August 2020, enrolled patients with advanced or recurrent EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC receiving osimertinib. Data on clinical outcomes, safety, disease progression, and subsequent treatments were collected for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. Of 583 patients receiving osimertinib, 39 (6.7%) had an uncommon EGFR mutation. The present study included 32 of these patients after excluding seven patients with an exon 20 insertion mutation. The overall objective response rate was 53.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.4-69.1], and the disease control rate was 78.1% (95% CI: 61.0-89.3).

Patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) derive remarkable survival benefits with osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is not known whether patients treated with osimertinib experience any weight loss or whether weight loss impacts patient outcomes. Therefore, we sought to describe the frequency and consequences of weight loss in this patient population. We conducted a single-center retrospective pilot study of 56 patients treated with first-line osimertinib for metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC. We defined on-treatment weight loss as a loss of \u22655% body weight at 6 or 12 months of treatment. We described the characteristics of patients with and without on-treatment weight loss and differences in progression-free survival (PFS), time on treatment with osimertinib, and overall survival (OS). Forty-six percent (n\u2005=\u200526) of patients met the criteria for on-treatment weight loss. There were no significant differences in patient or disease characteristics between patients with and without weight loss. Compared to patients without weight loss, patients with weight loss had similar PFS and time on treatment with osimertinib. Yet, patients with weight loss had significantly worse overall survival (HR 4.91, 95% CI, 1.56-15.5, P\u2005=\u2005.007).

However, data on the interstitial lung disease incidence during first-line osimertinib therapy and the course of lung cancer treatments administered after interstitial lung disease onset in the real-world setting are scarce. The present study reviewed the data from the Reiwa study, a multicentric, observational study examining the efficacy and safety of first-line osimertinib therapy in the clinical setting. Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer who began osimertinib therapy between September 2018 and August 2020 were enrolled and followed until August 2022. Among 583 patients receiving first-line osimertinib therapy, 75 (12.8%) had interstitial lung disease development, and 18 (3.0%) had at least grade 3 interstitial lung disease. Fifty-nine patients (78%) received some form of treatment following interstitial lung disease onset.

    "abstract": "Inevitable gefitinib resistance is the biggest bottleneck in current treatment and the mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we observe that PFTK1 (also named CDK14) is significantly enhanced in NSCLC with gefitinib resistance. And the upregulation of PFTK1 is negatively associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients who receive gefitinib treatment. Further study suggests that gefitinib can critically accelerate PFTK1 through suppressing its promoter methylation in a DNMT3B-dependent manner. Gain and loss of function assays demonstrate that desregulation of PFTK1 significantly enhances gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. PFTK1 interacts with LRP6 and activates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to attenuate gefitinib-induced cellular apoptosis. Moreover, FMF-04-159-2, a specific covalent inhibitor of PFTK1, can reverse the effect of PFTK1 on gefitinib resistance in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, these findings shed new light on the mechanism underlying gefitinib resistance, and suggest PFTK1 as a target for gefitinib treatment in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents over 80% of lung cancer cases and has a high mortality worldwide, however, targeting common epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) alterations (i.e., del19, L858R) has provided a paradigm shift in the treatment of NSCLC. Uncommon EGFR mutations, however, show variable efficacy to EGFR-targeted drugs depending on the molecular alterations within exons 18-21 which underlying biological mechanism are far from being clear. The substitution mutations of G719X in exon 18, L861Q in exon 21, S768I in exon 20, and exon 20 insertions are the most frequent mutations among the uncommon mutations. The development of fourth-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) has gained increased interest as these drugs are able to inhibit resistance mutations (e.g., C797S) often detected in NSCLC patients' resistance to third-generation EGFR TKIs. BDTX-1535 is an orally bioavailable, brain-penetrating, mutation-selective, irreversible EGFR inhibitor with significant antitumour activity in NSCLCs and glioblastomas (phase I/II trials ongoing). It is a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor that was found to overcome resistance to osimertinib in preclinical models and has shown promising activity in NSCLC patients harbouring C797S mutations. In experimental models BDTX-1535 was found to inhibit all common EGFR mutations and more than 50 of uncommon mutations including T790M, C797S, L718X, E709X, S784F, V834L and A289V, however, exon 20 insertions are inhibited to a much lesser extent. In addition, mutations in the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor (e.g., EGFRvII, III, IV) can be blocked as well. It should be noted that in up to 50% of all NSCLC patients who progress following osimertinib or other EGFR TKI therapy no underlying resistance mechanism can be identified suggesting that non-mutational signal transduction pathways may also be operative, and intratumoural heterogeneity has been found to be a major contributor to resistance and it consists of three main mechanisms: (I) drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, (II) chromosomal instability, and (III) extrachromosomal extracellular DNA (ecDNA) (seen in over 50% of NSCLCs) suggesting that novel EGFR TKIs will include many challenges in sufficiently targeting on-target resistance mechanisms. The development of novel drugs that can overcome TKI resistance in NSCLC patients harbouring the C797S mutation and beyond is, therefore, eagerly warranted.",

    "abstract": "There are currently various tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based regimens available, and it can be challenging for clinicians to determine the most effective and safe option due to the lack of direct comparisons between these regimens. In this study, we conducted a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of distinct regimens to determine the optimal regimen for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases and international conference databases were comprehensively searched from their inception to 02 April 2024 for collecting data regarding efficacy and safety from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Following literature screening and data extraction, a NMA was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety among 21 regimens with a random-effects consistency model in a Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation technique within the GEMTC package. A total of 35 RCTs were included, involving 9718 individuals and 21 regimens. Compared with other interventions, combination therapies based on third-generation TKIs, especially osimertinib plus ramucirumab, showed the most favorable PFS prolongation in overall patients. Consistently, subgroup analyses showed that third-generation TKIs-based combination regimens were superior to other regimens in most prespecified subgroups with distinct clinicopathological characteristics. In terms of overall survival, despite the combination regimens based on third-generation TKIs also showing relatively superior outcomes, erlotinib plus chemotherapy and gefitinib plus chemotherapy were ranked more favorably. In terms of safety profile, combination therapies based on third-generation TKIs did not significantly increase the incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events compared with other regimens. Our study concluded that combination regimens based on third-generation TKIs (osimertinib plus ramucirumab, osimertinib plus chemotherapy, osimertinib plus bevacizumab, amivantamab plus lazertinib and aumolertinib plus apatinib) could be the new and clinically preferable first-line, standard of care for EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

In vitro and in vivo experiments were also performed to examine the effect of PD-L1 overexpression on osimertinib susceptibility in EGFR T790\u00a0M\u00a0+\u00a0cells. A total of 134 pre-treated EGFR T790\u00a0M\u00a0+\u00a0patients were enrolled, of whom 72 had del19, 58 had L858R, and 4 had G719X as initial EGFR mutation subtype. Positive PD-L1 expression (TC\u00a0\u2265\u00a01%) was found in 21 of 134 (15.7%) patients. PD-L1 expression did not differ across different biopsied sites and among different EGFR mutation subgroups. Kaplan-Meier estimate revealed no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative patients. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model found that older age and L858R mutation were independent predictive factors. Multiplex IHC showed that immune cell infiltration was not associated with PD-L1 expression or osimertinib treatment response. By overexpressing PD-L1 in EGFR T790\u00a0M\u00a0+\u00a0cells, we found that PD-L1 did not result in osimertinib resistance in in vitro and xenograft models. PD-L1 expression in pre-treated EGFR T790\u00a0M\u00a0+\u00a0lung adenocarcinoma is not predictive of osimertinib efficacy, as demonstrated by in vitro, xenograft, and clinical case studies.",

    "title": "Combined Therapeutic Strategies Based on the Inhibition of Non-Oncogene Addiction to Improve Tumor Response in EGFR- and KRAS-Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Oncogene-driven NSCLC is usually treated with targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to inhibit oncogene downstream signaling pathways, affecting tumor survival and proliferation. EGFR- and KRAS-mutant NSCLCs are the most represented subtypes, and they are treated in clinical practice with oncogene-targeting drugs in the first and second line, respectively. Unfortunately, the development of oncogene-independent resistant clones limits TKI efficacy. Here, we used non-oncogene addiction (NOA) as an innovative therapeutic strategy to target other essential proteins that support changes in tumor phenotype. Specifically, we tested, for the first time, a combination of inhibitors, namely ATR, involved in DNA damage response, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), involved in energy metabolism. Sensitive PC9 and the corresponding EGFR-TKI-resistant PC9/OR, EGFR-mutant H1975, and KRAS-mutant A549 NSCLC cells, were treated with TKIs (osimertinib and selumetinib, respectively). In parallel, cells were exposed to two combination regimens: one using the TKI with an ATR inhibitor and the other one combining the two selected NOA inhibitors (ATR inhibitor, M4344; and PDK inhibitor, DCA). The effect of these two combined approaches, compared to TKI alone, produced similar results in terms of cell proliferation, cell death, and migration. Thus, depending on tumor biology, selecting between the proposed therapeutic strategies will be different, to maximize tumor response. The major translational relevance of this study is to exploit new targets for the development of innovative and improved therapeutic strategies with NOA drugs, over combinations including target genes within the oncogene pathway, to overcome resistance to TKI therapies in patients with NSCLC who are oncogene-addicted.",

    "abstract": "Overcoming resistance to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Osimertinib, particularly due to the emergence of the C797S mutation, remains a key challenge in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. This review highlights recent advancements in the development of fourth-generation EGFR inhibitors that specifically target the catalytic Lys745 residue, aiming to overcome resistance associated with Osimertinib. Both covalent and non-covalent inhibitors targeting Lys745 were explored, using warheads like sulfonyl fluoride, phosphine oxides, esters, and trisubstituted imidazoles. Sulfonyl fluoride was particularly effective in forming covalent bonds with Lys745, while non-covalent analogues demonstrated flexibility with reduced off-target effects. The manuscript highlights the importance of warhead design, molecular docking, protein XRD study and structure-activity relationships (SAR) for optimizing Lys745-targeting inhibitors. The study suggests that hybrid scaffolds combining key pharmacophoric features from Osimertinib and Brigatinib along with Lys745 targeting warheads, could enhance selectivity and potency. Future efforts should focus on refining bioavailability, identifying new scaffolds by employing drug design strategies. Fourth-generation TKIs targeting Lys745 offer a novel therapeutic avenue, potentially overcoming mutation-induced resistance and improving NSCLC treatment outcomes. This approach represents a critical advancement toward durable clinical responses in patients with drug-resistant cancer.",

    "abstract": "First-line osimertinib is widely used to treat patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). In clinical practice, rechallenge therapy with another EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is often performed after first-line TKI discontinuation owing to resistance or toxicity; however, the efficacy and toxicity of EGFR-TKI rechallenge after first-line osimertinib have not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI rechallenge with another TKI. This multicenter prospective observational study enrolled patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who received first-line osimertinib and another EGFR-TKI as second- or third-line treatment between September 2018 and August 2020. Fifty-three patients received rechallenge with another EGFR-TKI in the second-line (n\u2009=\u200938, 71.7%) or third-line (n\u2009=\u200915, 28.3%) setting. The primary reason for first-line osimertinib discontinuation was toxicity in 32 (60.4%, 17 patients with pneumonitis) and disease progression in 20 (37.7%) patients. The most common rechallenge EGFR-TKI was afatinib (n\u2009=\u200924, 45.3%), followed by gefitinib (n\u2009=\u200916, 30.2%) and erlotinib (n\u2009=\u20098, 15.1%). The real-world time to treatment failure (rwTTF) was 7.3\u2009months. The rwTTF for the toxicity discontinuation and progressive disease discontinuation groups was 9.3\u2009months and 5.1\u2009months, respectively, (HR 1.61, p\u2009=\u20090.119). EGFR-TKI rechallenge was discontinued due to toxicity in nine patients (17.0%), but no patient developed pneumonitis. EGFR-TKI rechallenge with another TKI is well tolerated in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Thus, it may be a useful treatment option after first-line osimertinib failure, especially after osimertinib discontinuation due to toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Although it has been reported that osimertinib mesylate provides better survival benefits compared with first- or second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), it remains unclear whether osimertinib is associated with more cancer therapy-related cardiac events (CTRCEs) compared with other EGFR TKIs, as does the extent of the association these adverse effects may have with overall survival. This issue is particularly critical due to the high prevalence of EGFR variants within Asian populations, including that of Taiwan. To compare CTRCEs and their association with survival in patients treated with osimertinib vs other EGFR TKIs. This cohort study was conducted at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a college hospital and tertiary academic referral center in Taiwan. The median follow-up duration was 23.2 (IQR, 15.2-31.5) months. A total of 401 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) beginning treatment with EGFR TKIs from September 1, 2019, to July 31, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. CTRCEs included newly emerging arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases (moderate and more), myocardial infarction, and heart failure and were analyzed after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, cardiovascular comorbidities, thoracic radiotherapy, and cardiovascular medications. Follow-up was completed January 31, 2024. Osimertinib. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate CTRCEs in patients treated with osimertinib or other EGFR TKIs. Considering that death can lower the incidence of CTRCEs, the competing risk method was used to calculate CTRCEs after adjusting for potential confounders. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis for overall survival was used to explore whether CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival. Among the 401 patients (253 [63.1%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.2 [11.3] years), 195 (48.6%) treated with osimertinib were matched with 206 (51.4%) treated with other EGFR TKIs. Occurrence of CTRCEs in patients receiving osimertinib was significantly higher compared with patients treated with other EGFR TKIs (29 [14.9%] vs 9 [4.4%]; hazard ratio [HR], 3.37; 95% CI, 1.56-7.26; P\u2009=\u2009.002). After adjustment for relevant cardiovascular risk factors, the HR of CTRCEs was significantly higher in the group treated with osimertinib (adjusted subdistribution HR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.81-8.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In addition, CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival (HR, 4.02; 95% CI, 2.44-6.63; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In this cohort study of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, osimertinib was associated with a higher incidence of CTRCEs compared with other EGFR TKIs; CTRCEs were independently associated with overall survival. These findings highlight the need for ongoing cardiac monitoring in these patients, regardless of preexisting cardiac risk factors.",

Among the 16 examined injections, butorphanol tartrate injection significantly inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells and increased the sensitivity of the EGFR-TKI-resistant H1975 cell line to gefitinib. Benzethonium chloride (BC) is the main active antitumor ingredient of butorphanol tartrate injection.

However, inevitable acquired resistance to osimertinib limits its clinical utility, and there is a lack of effective countermeasures. Here, we established osimertinib-resistant cell lines and performed drug library screening. This screening identified ivacaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, as a synergistic enhancer of osimertinib-induced anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ivacaftor facilitated the colocalization of CFTR and PTEN on the plasma membrane to promote the function of PTEN, subsequently inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and suppressing tumor growth. In summary, our study suggests that activating CFTR enhances osimertinib-induced anti-tumor activity by regulating the PTEN-AKT axis. Furthermore, ivacaftor and osimertinib constitute a potential combination strategy for treating osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in precision medicine have shifted the treatment paradigm of brain metastases (BM) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and melanoma, especially through targeted therapies focused on specific molecular drivers. These novel agents have improved outcomes by overcoming challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resistance mechanisms, enabling more effective treatment of BM. In NSCLC, therapies such as osimertinib have improved efficacy in treating EGFR-mutant BM, with emerging combinations such as amivantamab and lazertinib offering promising alternatives for patients resistant to frontline therapies. In HER2-positive breast cancer, significant advancements with tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have transformed the treatment landscape, achieving improved survival and intracranial control in patients with BM. Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), novel therapies such as sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) offer new hope for managing BM. For melanoma, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and ipilimumab has proven effective in enhancing survival for patients with BM, both in BRAF-mutant and wild-type cases. Developing targeted therapies penetrating the BBB has revolutionized\u00a0BM treatment by targeting key drivers like EGFR, ALK, HER2, and BRAF.

The treatment landscape for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved substantially, especially with the introduction of targeted therapies such as osimertinib, a third-generation\u00a0EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This narrative review examines the impact of osimertinib on survival rates in early-stage lung cancer and underscores the importance of early diagnosis and treatment initiation. We explore the genetic underpinnings of NSCLC, focusing on the role of EGFR\u00a0mutations, and discuss the prevalence of early-stage lung cancer and the urgent need for timely intervention.\u00a0 Additionally, the review assesses osimertinib's safety and efficacy in patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated lung cancer, drawing from a wide range of studies and clinical trials. Findings suggest that osimertinib has the\u00a0potential to improve overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to traditional treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, and first-generation EGFR-TKIs. The therapeutic profile of osimertinib is comprehensively analyzed, including its associated adverse events, clinical outcomes, and its impact on quality of life. We also address potential challenges with osimertinib, such as resistance mechanisms and the need for personalized treatment approaches. Despite these challenges,\u00a0osimertinib emerges as a promising and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with\u00a0EGFR\u00a0mutations in early-stage lung cancer. The review highlights the importance of incorporating osimertinib into standard treatment regimens to improve patient outcomes and survival rates in early-stage lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "For patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who progress on osimertinib, the clinical benefit of continuing osimertinib with next line platinum pemetrexed chemotherapy remains unknown. In this international, multi-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 159 patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who progressed on osimertinib and received platinum-pemetrexed therapy on progression from 2013 to 2023 were included. The data cutoff was December 31, 2023. Data analysis was conducted from January 2024 to June 2024. The primary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariable Cox regression adjusting for patient-specific and cancer-specific factors was performed. 421 patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC with progression on osimertinib were identified, of which159 patients who met pre-specified inclusion criteria were divided into two groups: Cohort 1 (osimertinib\u00a0+\u00a0platinum-pemetrexed) included 50 patients (median [IQR] age, 59 [30 - 83] years; 36 [72.0\u00a0%] female; 11 [22.4\u00a0%] Asian) and Cohort 2 (platinum-pemetrexed alone) included 109 patients (median [IQR] age, 54 [25 - 80] years; 62 [56.9\u00a0%] female; 74 [64.9\u00a0%] Asian). Most patients were never smokers (Cohort 1, 37 [74.0\u00a0%]; Cohort 2, 66 [60.6\u00a0%]). One third of patients had baseline brain metastases (Cohort 1, 19 [38.0\u00a0%]; Cohort 2, 36 [38.3\u00a0%]). Both cohorts had a median of two prior lines of anti-cancer therapy. The addition of bevacizumab or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to next-line platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy was more common in Cohort 2 (bevacizumab use, 30.3\u00a0% vs 8.0\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; ICI use, 33.0\u00a0% vs 2.0\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). With a median duration of follow up of 30\u00a0months, there was a significant PFS benefit to continuing osimertinib with next line platinum pemetrexed chemotherapy (9.0 vs 4.5\u00a0months; HR 0.49, 95\u00a0% CI 0.32 - 0.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032), also seen in subset analyses of patients who received first line osimertinib (n\u00a0=\u00a055, 11.0 vs 6.2\u00a0months; HR 0.41, 95\u00a0% CI 0.25 - 0.73, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Among patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC without brain metastases after progression on osimertinib, we found that continuing osimertinib with next line platinum pemetrexed significantly reduced the median time to CNS progression (n\u00a0=\u00a038; 7.0 vs 4.1\u00a0months; HR 0.47, 95\u00a0% CI 0.48 - 0.98, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). After adjusted analysis, there was no significant OS difference between Cohorts 1 and 2 (19\u00a0months vs 13\u00a0months; HR 0.92, 95\u00a0% CI 0.60 - 1.39, p\u00a0=\u00a00.68). For patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who progress on osimertinib, there is a significant PFS, but not OS, benefit to continuing osimertinib with next line platinum pemetrexed chemotherapy. The continuation of osimertinib with next line platinum pemetrexed chemotherapy appears to reduce the risk of CNS progression.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer mortality, often involves epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, common in 17% of Caucasian and 40% of Asian non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. While the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation are prevalent, rare variants like L833V/H835L are less understood. This case reports a 75-year-old female with NSCLC harboring L833V/H835L mutations. Initial imaging showed a right upper lobe mass and nodularity in the left upper lobe. Biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, and genomic analysis identified EGFR L833V/H835L mutations. Based on these findings, the patient was treated with osimertinib 160 mg daily, reduced to 80 mg due to side effects. After 3 months, positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed significant tumor reduction, and brain metastasis remained stable. This case demonstrates the efficacy of osimertinib for rare EGFR mutations, aligning with literature suggesting its potential for managing such variants. Although large-scale trials are impractical due to the rarity of these mutations, this report adds valuable evidence supporting osimertinib's use, highlighting the need for comprehensive genomic profiling in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Although clinical trials of systemic chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have included both postoperative recurrence and de novo unresectable cases, postoperative recurrence is reported to have a better efficacy and prognosis. However, there are no efficacy data of first-line osimertinib for postoperative recurrence. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a multicenter, prospective, observational study that evaluated the efficacy of first-line osimertinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive NSCLC. The patients were divided into two groups: those with postoperative recurrence (recurrence group, n\u00a0=\u00a0167) and those with de novo unresectable disease (de novo group, n\u00a0=\u00a0385). The recurrence group had a significantly better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and fewer bone metastases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), brain metastases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), cancer pleurisy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), pleural dissemination (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), liver metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), and adrenal metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) at the start of osimertinib than the de novo group. The recurrence group had a significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than the de novo group (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.81, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; and HR = 0.58, 95\u00a0% CI, 0.43-0.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). In a 1:1 propensity score-matching analysis, the matched recurrence group had significantly better PFS and OS than the matched de novo group (HR = 0.72, 95\u00a0% CI, 0.52-0.99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034; and HR = 0.65, 95\u00a0% CI, 0.44-0.95, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). Patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC and postoperative recurrence have a better ECOG-PS and fewer distant metastases at the start of first-line osimertinib, and better PFS and OS than those with de novo unresectable disease. Postoperative recurrence should be considered as a stratification factor in future clinical trials for advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) frequently acquire resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) due to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or activation of the bypass pathway involving mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (Met). To address this challenge, a bispecific nanobody-aptamer chimera is designed to target mutated EGFR and Met simultaneously to block their cross-talk in NSCLC. The EGFR-Met chimera is cost-effectively engineered using microbial transglutaminase and click chemistry strategies. With enhanced binding affinity toward the target proteins, the as-developed chimera inhibits efficiently the cross-talk between signaling pathways associated with EGFR and Met. This inhibition leads to the suppression of downstream pathways, such as Erk and Akt, and induces upregulation of cell cycle arrest-related proteins, including Rb, p21, and p27. Additionally, the chimera activates the caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling pathway. Consequently, it inhibits cell migration, induces cell death, and causes cell cycle arrest in vitro. Moreover, the chimera exhibits significant antitumor efficacy in drug-resistant xenograft mouse models, showcasing improved tissue penetration and low toxicity. This study accentuates the potential of the bispecific EGFR-Met chimera as a promising therapeutic option for NSCLC resistant to EGFR TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 84% of all lung cancers and continues to remain the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The advent of gene targeted therapies has changed the landscape of NSCLC management. Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has activity against exon 19, exon 21 (L858R) mutations. It is also active against T790M mutation which is the most common resistant mechanism to earlier generation TKIs. Activity of osimertinib against rare EGFR mutations is largely unknown. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with metastatic NSCLC carrying an exceedingly rare deletion-insertion exon 19 EGFR mutation (p.E746_S752delinsV) who demonstrated sustained disease control with osimertinib, achieving a progression-free survival of 26 months. A 64-year-old nonsmoker female presented with back pain for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging spine showed pathological fracture secondary to multiple lytic lesions. She underwent FDG PET/CT that showed large left lower lobe mass, bilateral pulmonary nodules, widespread osteolytic lesions. She underwent iliac lytic lesion biopsy that was consistent with adenocarcinoma (TTF1- and CK7-positive). Tumor tissue next-generation sequencing showed EGFR exon 19 mutation (DNA change: c.2237_2255delinsT, amino acid change: p.E746_S752delinsV [Glu 746_Ser752delinsval]). She was started on osimertinib and showed clinical response within 2 weeks of starting therapy. She was able to maintain a response for 26 months since starting treatment. In summary, there are limited prospective data to guide therapy in patients with rare EGFR mutations. Prospective studies are required to evaluate the response to endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with rare EGFR mutations in order to ensure patient safety and response to treatment in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "For epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)gene mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, molecular targeted therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKIs)is the mainstay of treatment. In Japan, 5 EGFR-TKIs[gefitinib and erlotinib(first-generation), afatinib and dacomitinib(second-generation), and osimertinib(third-generation)]have been approved, and only ramucirumab, an anti-angiogenic agent, has been approved for use in combination with the first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Since only osimertinib is approved for use in second-line therapy in the patients with confirmed T790M mutation after EGFR-TKI treatment, any other EGFR-TKI than osimertinib has to be selected as the first-line therapy of sequential treatment using EGFR-TKIs both as first-line and second-line therapy. Treatment options vary widely, and it is therefore important to select an optimal treatment based on clinical information such as a subtype of the EGFR gene mutation, as well as the patient's preference to potentially use molecular targeted therapy for second-line therapy. This article outlines clinical study data on the use of EGFR-TKIs as first- and second-line therapies and the use in combination with anti-angiogenic agents. It also describes our clinical experience with a successful shift from first-line therapy with an EGFR-TKI to second-line therapy with EGFR-TKI in sequential treatment.",

The predictability of the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on survival outcomes depending on the generation of EGFR TKI is undetermined. 151 patients treated with EGFR TKIs in Los Angeles were grouped according to generation of TKI. Differences in progression free survival (PFS) by stratification by PLR was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Differences in median change in laboratory markers by generation of TKI was analyzed using Mann-Whitney tests. Cox Hazard Regression was used to perform multivariate analysis. Median PFS of those managed with 1st or 2nd generation TKIs was significantly lower in patients with a PLR\u2009\u2265\u2009180 (10.5\u00a0months) compared to those with PLR\u2009<\u2009180 (16.6\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.0163).

Patients managed with osimertinib had a significant decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at 6\u00a0weeks and in platelets at 6\u00a0weeks and 3\u00a0months compared to those managed with 1st or 2nd generation TKIs. The predictive value of PLR was more apparent in patients treated with 1st or 2nd generation TKIs compared to those treated with osimertinib.

Here, we describe our modified AB assay method to avoid that right shift in dose response curves.\u2022Removal of the drug containing medium prior to AB addition eliminated the falsely increased readings, giving comparable dose response curves as determined by Cell Titer Glo assay.\u2022Plate-to-plate variability can be minimized by adding an appropriate concentration of a common fluorescence calibration standard to the assay plates to calibrate fluorimeter sensitivity.\u2022Alamar Blue can be used as a continuous longitudinal assay to monitor cell growth or recovery from drug toxicity over time.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are effective for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with  This random-effect Bayesian framed network meta-analysis (NMA) only included exclusively randomized clinical trials with demonstrated evidence on safety of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutation. Pooled odds ratios and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) were calculated to depict the toxicity map of EGFR-TKIs. This review included 23 randomized clinical trials incorporating 7,006 patients and 11 treatments: erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, osimertinib, furmonertinib, aumolertinib, pemetrexed-free chemotherapy (PfCT), pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (PbCT) and placebo. Overall, chemotherapy and second-generation EGFR-TKIs exhibited higher toxicity. A toxicity sequence according to the likelihood of causing grade \u22653 adverse events (AEs) was identified as follows: PfCT > PbCT > afatinib > dacomitinib > erlotinib > aumolertinib > gefitinib > furmonertinib > osimertinib > placebo > icotinib. For discontinuation due to AEs, among EGFR-TKIs, icotinib and afatinib demonstrated best and second-best safety profiles according to pooled odds ratios and SUCRA. Regarding specific toxicity, EGFR-TKIs demonstrated variable toxicity intensity and different predominate toxicity spectrums. This is the first study to depict the difference in toxicity of EGFR-TKIs in a population with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In general, osimertinib and icotinib were associated with favorable safety compared with other EGFR-TKIs. Difference in safety between the third-generation EGFR-TKIs was also first investigated comprehensively. Furthermore, this review elaborated the varied predominate spectrum and ranked the toxicity of EGFR-TKIs for providing toxicity rationale for treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Overcoming resistance to Osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is clinically challenging because the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The murine double minute 2 (MDM2) has been extensively described as a tumor promotor in various malignancies, mainly through a negative regulatory machinery on the p53 tumor suppressor. However, the significance of MDM2 on the sensitivity to Osimertinib has not been described. Osimertinib resistant cells were generated by standard dose escalation strategy and individual resistant clones were isolated for MDM2 testing. The MDM2 and its mutant constructs (\u0394PBD, \u0394RING, C464A) were introduced into PC-9, HCC827 and H1975 cells and evaluated for the sensitivity to Osimertinib by MTT assay, colony formation, EdU assay and TUNEL assay. MDM2 expression in resistant cells was manipulated by pharmacological and molecular approaches, respectively. Proteins that were implicated in PI3K/Akt, MAPK/Erk and apoptosis signaling were measured by Western blot analysis. Candidate proteins that interacted with MDM2 were captured by immunoprecipitation and probed with indicated antibodies. In comparison with parental PC-9 cells, the PC-9 OR resistant cells expressed high level of MDM2. Ectopic expression of MDM2 in PC-9, HCC827 and H1975 sensitive cells generated an Osimertinib resistant phenotype, regardless of p53 status. MDM2 promoted resistance to Osimertinib through a PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk-independent machinery, in contrast, MDM2 selectively stabilized MCL-1 protein to arrest Osimertinib-induced cancer cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, MDM2 acted as a E3 ligase to ubiquitinate FBW7, a well-established E3 ligase for MCL-1, at Lys412 residue, which resulted in FBW7 destruction and MCL-1 stabilization. Targeting MDM2 to augment MCL-1 protein breakdown overcame resistance to Osimertinib in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the clinical relevance of MDM2-FBW7-MCL-1 regulatory axis was validated in mouse xenograft tumor model and in NSCLC specimen. Overexpression of MDM2 is a novel resistant mechanism to Osimertinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC. MDM2 utilizes its E3 ligase activity to provoke FBW7 destruction and sequentially leads to MCL-1 stabilization. Cancer cells with aberrant MDM2 state are refractory to apoptosis induction and elicit a resistant phenotype to Osimertinib. Therefore, targeting MDM2 would be a feasible approach to overcome resistance to Osimertinib in EGFR mutant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab in treating advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Up to May 26, 2024, the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature, China Science and Technology Journal, and Wanfang were searched, and the randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of osimertinib plus bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC were included. Two researchers independently screened the literature, assessed the quality of the included literature, and extracted the literature data. Revman5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. A total of 824 patients were included in 10 RCTs. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group (osimertinib alone), the experimental group (osimertinib plus bevacizumab) had a higher objective response rate (ORR) (relative risk [RR]\u2005=\u20051.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.47, P\u2005=\u2005.02), and the experimental group could significantly reduce the expression levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (mean difference [SMD]\u2005=\u20050.82, 95% CI = 0.30-1.35, P\u2005=\u2005.002), vascular endothelial growth factor (SMD\u2005=\u20050.43, 95% CI = 0.13-0.73, P\u2005=\u2005.005), neuron-specific enolase (SMD\u2005=\u20050.88, 95% CI = 0.60-1.17, P\u2005<\u2005.00001), cytokeratin 19 fragments (SMD\u2005=\u20051.33, 95% CI = 0.34-2.33, P\u2005=\u2005.009), and carbohydrate antigen 125 (SMD\u2005=\u20050.46, 95% CI = 0.15-0.77, P\u2005=\u2005.004) in serum. However, the experimental group did not significantly improve the disease control rate (DCR) (RR\u2005=\u20051.17, 95% CI = 1.00-1.36, P\u2005=\u2005.05), 1- and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates (RR\u2005=\u20051.15, 95% CI = 1.00-1.33, P\u2005=\u2005.05; RR\u2005=\u20051.02, 95% CI = 0.74-1.40, P\u2005=\u2005.92), 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates (RR\u2005=\u20051.11, 95% CI = 0.92-1.36, P\u2005=\u2005.28; RR\u2005=\u20050.99, 95% CI = 0.84-1.18, P\u2005=\u2005.95). Interestingly, the results of subgroup analysis showed that the experimental group significantly improved ORR, DCR, 1-year PFS, and OS rates in the Chinese population and patients under 65 years old (P\u2005<\u2005.05). In addition, when the dose of bevacizumab was 7.5\u2009mg/kg q3w in the experimental group, ORR, DCR, 1-year PFS, and OS rates were significantly better than those in the control group (P\u2005<\u2005.05). In terms of adverse events of drugs, the incidence of proteinuria, hypertension, oral mucositis, bleeding, nausea, and vomiting in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (P\u2005<\u2005.05). For patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, osimertinib plus bevacizumab has some clinical benefit compared with osimertinib alone. Still, it does not provide additional long-term survival benefits and has higher toxicity. More well-designed, multicenter RCTs are needed to identify the subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from this combination regimen and to validate the optimal dose of this combination regimen.",

However, the best option has yet to be determined. This study compares the efficacy and safety of various first-line EGFR-TKI monotherapies and combination treatments for advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials databases, and several international conferences to identify randomized controlled trials reporting on first-line EGFR-TKI treatments for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The study quality was assessed using the revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials. The efficacy and safety outcomes of the included treatments were compared by network meta-analysis based on a frequentist approach. We identified 26 trials (8,359 patients) investigating 14 treatment groups, including first, second, and third-generation EGFR-TKIs and their combination treatments. Osimertinib plus chemotherapy and lazertinib plus amivantamab showed the highest efficacy in improving progression-free survival. New third-generation EGFR-TKIs demonstrated comparable efficacy to osimertinib alone but did not surpass it. Subgroup analyses revealed slight variation in treatment efficacy based on mutation types and patient demographics. Combination treatments were associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. These results reveal that osimertinib plus chemotherapy and lazertinib plus amivantamab are superior first-line options for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However, these combinations are associated with higher adverse event rates.",

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and VIP databases were used to conduct extensive searches for relevant randomized controlled trials until January 30, 2024. Osimertinib monotherapy favored disease control rate, whereas the comparator treatment arm favored overall survival. Using subgroup analysis, the objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly elevated by Osimertinib monotherapy compared with pemetrexed combined with carboplatin or cisplatin. The comparator treatment arm receiving gefitinib or erlotinib significantly favored progression-free survival and overall survival compared with osimertinib monotherapy. In patients treated with osimertinib monotherapy, the incidence of all adverse events (AEs) decreased compared with comparator treatment arm. Anemia was the only AE associated with osimertinib monotherapy. Pemetrexed combined with carboplatin or cisplatin resulted in greater loss of appetite than osimertinib monotherapy. The most associated AE of osimertinib monotherapy was diarrhea, according to network analysis.

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being a primary contributor to cancer-related deaths. Traditional treatment strategies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy often present challenges, including severe side effects, drug resistance, and toxicity. Recent advancements in nanotechnology aim to enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapies by targeting drugs selectively and specifically to tumor cells. Among these innovations, exosomes, or small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), have emerged as promising carriers for drug delivery due to their natural origin and ability to encapsulate both small molecules and biologics. This study explores the use of exosomes derived from camel milk in Hail, Saudi Arabia, as a vehicle for delivering curcumin (CUR), a polyphenol with known chemopreventive properties but limited bioavailability. Camel milk was processed to isolate exosomes through differential centrifugation, followed by characterization using dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurements, and Western blot analysis to confirm exosomal markers. The encapsulation of CUR into camel milk-derived exosomes demonstrated a 20% loading efficiency as analyzed by UPLC. In vitro antiproliferative assays revealed that the exosomal formulation of CUR (ExoCUR) significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against drug-sensitive (A549) and taxol-resistant (A549TR) lung cancer cells compared to free CUR. Molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that CUR has a strong binding affinity for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), comparable to the established drug gefitinib. Furthermore, CUR effectively downregulated EGFR and STAT3 expression in lung cancer cells, suggesting its potential to disrupt key signaling pathways involved in tumor progression. Our findings highlight the potential of camel milk-derived exosomes as an effective and biocompatible delivery system for CUR, offering a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of current cancer therapies and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of chemopreventive agents.",

Inhibin beta A (INHBA) is a ligand of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. This study aimed to analyze the function of INHBA in NSCLC resistance cells. Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NSCLC resistance cells and patients. DEGs were further analyzed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. A colony formation assay was performed to determine cell growth. Cell migration and invasion were tested by Transwell assay. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Using bioinformatics tools, INHBA was demonstrated to be overexpressed in NSCLC resistant cells and patients. Gefitinib treatment affected NSCLC resistant cells. Additionally, INHBA silencing or X-ray treatment suppressed the growth and metastasis of NSCLC resistant cells. Moreover, the combined application of INHBA silencing and X-ray treatment enhances the therapeutic effects. Moreover, EMT has been confirmed to occur in NSCLC resistant cell lines. Both INHBA silencing and X-ray treatment inhibited EMT development. This study demonstrated that INHBA silencing ameliorates EGFR-TKI resistance and enhances the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy in NSCLC.",

This review aims to summarise the available evidence on these particularities, especially focusing on patient characteristics, treatment outcomes and safety with EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI). An exhaustive search of international bibliographic databases, as well as in abstracts of communications from major international congresses was performed for evidence related to EGFR-mutated NSCLC or early-stage NSCLC published in English before December 31st, 2023. Early-stage NSCLC with EGFR mutation presents with a variable incidence depending on geographical aspects. The clinical, radiological and molecular features differ slightly from both early-stage NSCLC without EGFR mutation and advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation. Adjuvant treatment with the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib has led to improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) in these patients, representing a practice changing and a new standard of care in clinical practice. No new safety signals have been reported with EGFR-TKI in the adjuvant setting. Clinical trials are ongoing to explore new therapeutic options in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting as well as the optimal duration of adjuvant osimertinib. Detection of EGFR mutation in early-stage NSCLC is an important goal due to the different characteristics and additional therapeutic options that improve patient outcomes and follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations are critical factors in the development of EGFR-driven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and molecular targeted therapies have focused on inhibiting these mutations. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have remarkable inhibitory effects on NSCLC with EGFR mutations. However, acquired resistance limits the clinical application of EGFR-TKIs, highlighting the need for discovery of novel therapeutic strategies. 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone is a natural product derived from Garcinia xanthochymus, has shown potential anti-tumor activity, but the underlying mechanism needs further elucidation. In this study, we developed Ba/F3 and NIH/3T3 cells harboring EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S mutation, and then found that 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone exerted inhibitory effects against cells with EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S mutation. Additionally, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against cells harboring the triple-mutant EGFR by promoting apoptosis and inducing changes in cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone was found to significantly reduce tumor growth via suppressing the phosphorylation of EGFR in tumor tissues. These effects are associated with binding of 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone to EGFR resulting in the suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-7,8-diprenylxanthone may be a potential novel candidate for further investigation and treatment of NSCLC with the triple-mutant EGFR.",

    "abstract": "Single-agent osimertinib has improved outcomes in EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BMs), but still, 40\u202f% of them will experience an intracranial progression. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the role of brain radiotherapy upfront plus osimertinib. We evaluated articles comparing the use of osimertinib versus osimertinib plus brain radiotherapy. We included 897 patients from nine retrospective studies. Patients treated with combination therapy had an improvement in intracranial progression-free survival (HR 0.76; 95\u202f% CI 0.61-0.94) and overall survival (HR 0.56; 95\u202f% CI 0.36-0.87) with an acceptable safety profile. Osimertinib with upfront brain radiotherapy may be a suitable first-line treatment option for EGFR mutated patients with BMs at diagnosis. The main limitations of this analysis are the retrospective nature and the inability to control for a single variable of interest. Despite that, the combination of osimertinib and upfront brain radiotherapy is a treatment strategy that deserves further prospective trials.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the first cause of cancer-related death. Thus, finding alternative therapeutic options is crucial. Drug repurposing offers therapeutic options in a simplified and affordable manner, especially to cancer patients in developing countries. Several drugs including antihistamines and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) display antiproliferative properties on cancer cells. Interestingly, NSCLC patients who had used either antihistamines or beta-blockers showed improved response to chemotherapy or reduced mortality in comparison to non-users of any of these drugs. However, combination therapy is gaining substantial interest in many cancers including non-EGFR mutated NSCLC. Here, we investigated the antineoplastic effect of the combination of the antihistamine loratadine, the beta-blocker nebivolol, and the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib on NSCLC cell lines. A-549 and NCI-H1975 cell lines were used. The effect of nebivolol, gefitinib, and loratadine on the metabolic activity was studied using the MTT assay. The inhibitory concentrations (IC The combination nebivolol-loratadine-gefitinib produced a significant synergistic effect on inhibiting the metabolic activity and colony formation, as well as on promoting apoptosis in both cell lines. Noteworthy, the effect on the cell line carrying the EGFR mutation (NCI-H1975) was very similar to the cell line that does not exhibit such mutation (A-549 cells). The nebivolol-gefitinib-loratadine combination may be a promising alternative for lung cancer treatment.",

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of a combination therapy consisting of gefitinib, bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations. Eligible patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-squamous NSCLC were recruited and received gefitinib combination with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed and carboplatin treatment. The primary endpoints were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS).

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a prevalent and fatal malignancy with a significant global impact. Recent advancements have introduced targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as osimertinib, which have improved patient outcomes, particularly in those with EGFR mutations. Despite these advancements, acquired resistance to TKIs remains a significant challenge. Hence, one of the current research priorities is understanding the resistance mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets to improve therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we identified high expression of c-Met in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells, and depletion of c-Met significantly inhibited the proliferation of osimertinib-resistant cells and prolonged survival in mice, suggesting c-Met as an attractive therapeutic target. To identify effective anti-tumor agents targeting c-Met, we screened a compound library containing 641 natural products and found that only xanthohumol exhibited potent inhibitory effects against osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Moreover, combination treatment with xanthohumol and osimertinib sensitized osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells to osimertinib both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, xanthohumol disrupted the interaction between USP9X and Ets-1, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Ets-1 at Thr38, promoting its degradation, thereby targeting the Ets-1/c-Met signaling axis and inducing intrinsic apoptosis in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Overall, the research highlights the critical role of targeting c-Met to address osimertinib resistance in NSCLC. By demonstrating the efficacy of xanthohumol in overcoming resistance and enhancing therapeutic outcomes, this study provides valuable insights and potential new strategies for improving the clinical management of NSCLC.",

While clinical studies have identified common co-mutations in TP53, LRP1B, STK11, KEAP1, and KRAS, actionable driver mutations such as EGFR or ALK are rarely reported in conjunction with SMARCA4 deficiency. This case presents a rare instance of NSCLC featuring both an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation and SMARCA4 deficiency, highlighting the challenges in treatment and the need for novel therapeutic strategies. A 79-year-old female patient presented with concerns of a lung mass, suspected to be peripheral lung cancer based on diagnostic imaging. Histopathological evaluation confirmed SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. Molecular genetic analysis further revealed an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation. The patient was initially treated with osimertinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Upon disease progression, treatment was adjusted to include anlotinib in combination with ongoing osimertinib. The initial treatment with osimertinib led to partial remission. However, disease progression necessitated a change in therapy. The combination treatment stabilized the disease temporarily, achieving a stable disease status. This case underscores the transient efficacy of targeted therapy in SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC with concurrent EGFR mutations. It highlights the need for continuous therapeutic adjustments and emphasizes the importance of further research into effective strategies for treating this complex and challenging subset of NSCLC, as current modalities have limitations in sustained efficacy.",

    "abstract": "For patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progress on first-line osimertinib, the optimal second-line treatment regimen after progression is not known. We sought to assess practice patterns and evaluate the association between different therapies and survival in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC following progression on first-line osimertinib. Retrospective cohort study of patients who received first-line treatment with osimertinib using a population-based, multicenter nationwide electronic health record-derived deidentified database. We identified 2373 patients who received first-line osimertinib. The majority (n = 2279) received osimertinib monotherapy. A total of 538 patients received first-line osimertinib and had second-line treatment data available. Second-line treatment regimens were varied: 65% (n = 348) included chemotherapy, 37% (n = 197) included an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and 44% (n = 234) included an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). We then analyzed the 333 patients with performance status 0-2 who received chemotherapy with osimertinib (n = 107, 32%) versus chemotherapy without osimertinib (n = 226, 68%). The continuation of osimertinib with chemotherapy was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS; median: 10.1 versus 5.9 months, Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: [0.34, 0.68], P < .001) and overall survival (OS; median: 17.0 versus 12.8 months, HR: 0.64, 95% CI: [0.44, 0.93], P = .018) compared to other chemotherapy approaches without osimertinib. This effect was most pronounced in patients with an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Following progression on osimertinib, a wide variety of treatment regimens were used. The continuation of osimertinib with chemotherapy in the second line was associated with increased PFS and OS.",

However, limited data exist for a comprehensive cardiotoxicity profile analysis for osimertinib use in NSCLC patients. The aim of this study was to report the entire profile of cardiotoxicities after the initiation of osimertinib in consecutive patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation at a single health system. The data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records for all patients who were started on osimertinib for NSCLC at West Virginia University Health System. Prevalence of heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation, and prolonged QT before and after starting osimertinib were calculated. This study had 116 participants and the median age was 72 years. The frequency of each new cardiotoxicity was between 6% and 9%, and the overall percentage of patients who had developed any of the four cardiotoxicities while on osimertinib was 19.9%. The median time of follow-up was 477 days and the median time on osimertinib for all patients was 390 days. The strongest risk factor in predicting a new onset cardiac event was hypertension with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.35 (confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 27.23, p=0.013) and HR 5.36 (CI 1.23 to 23.39, p=0.025) in univariate and multivariate analysis respectively. Osimertinib appears to be associated with an increase in cardiac abnormalities. Given the association between this medication exposure and the observed cardiac toxicities, use of osimertinib may entail closer cardiac monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram abnormalities.",

Recently, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) expression have been demonstrated to mediate NSCLC resistance to gefitinib, first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Here, we further investigated the effect of CyH on EGFR activation, PD-L1 expression, and gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC cell lines, A549 (wild-type EGFR), HCC827 (EGFR mutation), and NCI-H1975 (dual EGFR mutations and acquired gefitinib resistance) and animal model. Our results showed that CyH significantly inhibited EGFR activation and PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Additionally, CyH dramatically promoted the inhibitory effect of gefitinib on the proliferation of A549 and HCC827 cells, and enhanced the sensitivity to gefitinib in NCI-H1975 cells. Moreover, CyH increased the inhibitory effect of gefitinib on EGFR activation and PD-L1 expression in HCC827 and NCI-H1975 cells. Animal experiments further demonstrated that CyH significantly promoted the inhibitory effect of gefitinib on the growth of NSCLC and the expression of Ki-67, p-EGFR, and PD-L1 in NCI-H1975 NSCLC xenograft tumors of nude mice. Furthermore, CyH inhibited the activation of JAK3/STAT signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that CyH promotes the sensitivity to gefitinib in NSCLC cells through the inhibition of EGFR activation and PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "It has been confirmed that bee venom (BV) can inhibit tumor metastasis of lung cancer cells induced by epidermal growth factor, suggesting the inhibitory role of BV on the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and may synergistically promote the anti-lung cancer effect of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. This paper aims to ascertain the therapeutic potentials of BV combined with gefitinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vitro. As results, the content of the main component melittin in air-dried BV was determined by HPLC. Subsequently, it was found that BV significantly inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC PC-9 and NCI-H1299\u00a0cells, but not generated apparent toxicity to human normal lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Meanwhile, the combination of BV and gefitinib also significantly inhibited the proliferation of these two cells, and suppressed the migration and invasion of PC-9\u00a0cells. By bioinformatics analysis and molecular docking, it was predicted that the main component melittin in BV could act on the cell membrane and transmembrane protein EGFR. Ultimately, Western blot assays showed BV alone or combined with gefitinib significantly decreased the protein expression of phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) and the protein expression ratio of p-EGFR to EGFR, and increased the protein expression ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in PC-9\u00a0cells or epidermal growth factor-activated PC-9\u00a0cells. The results demonstrated that BV could prompt the inhibition of gefitinib on proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells via EGFR-mediated autophagy, showing the synergistic anti-NSCLC potential when combined with gefitinib.",

    "abstract": "Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have emerged as the mainstay of treatment for advanced EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), effectively overcoming the problems of acquired threonine-to-methionine (T790M) mutations associated with the first- or second-generation TKIs. Evidence from several studies suggests that these agents, including osimertinib and aumolertinib, also show potential benefits in T790M-negative or unknown populations, particularly those with brain metastases, where the high permeability of the blood-brain barrier allows effective control of intracranial lesions. Despite the encouraging results, further high-quality research, including prospective trials, is warranted to fully elucidate the efficacy profiles of these third-generation TKIs in T790M-negative or unknown NSCLC patients after first- or second-line TKI failure. The present expert consensus highlights the evolving role of third-generation EGFR-TKIs in overcoming therapeutic resistance and optimizing patient outcomes. Experts agree on treating lung cancer with specific gene changes using advanced medicines Newer medicines called third-generation EGFR inhibitors have become key treatments for a type of advanced lung cancer that has specific genetic changes. These drugs, such as osimertinib and aumolertinib, solve a problem encountered with older drugs: resistance caused by a mutation known as T790M. They\u2019re especially promising for patients whose cancer has spread to the brain, because they can pass through the brain\u2019s protective barrier and help control tumors there. While current evidence suggests these new drugs can help even when the T790M mutation isn\u2019t present or hasn\u2019t been tested for, more research is needed to fully understand how well they work in these situations. After other treatments have stopped being effective, using these advanced medicines may offer new hope by tackling treatment resistance and improving patients\u2019 chances. This expert agreement outlines how these newer drugs are changing the way we overcome therapy challenges and enhance patient care.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and the world. It is divided into two major types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) cancer-staging classification system (Stages I/II/III/IV), the severity of neoplastic growth is characterized by the size of the tumor (T1 to T4), the extent of lymph node involvement (N0 to N3), and whether (M1) or not (M0) distant metastasis has occurred. Surgery is the treatment of choice for medically fit patients with Stage I/II NSCLC. Combination chemoradiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy are used across all NSCLC types. Oncogene-addicted tumors with sensitizing EGFR or BRAF mutations or activating ALK, ROS1 or NTRK translocations are treated with their cognate orally active small molecule protein kinase blockers. On the order of 20\u202f% of NSCLCs bear activating mutations in EGFR and are treated with osimertinib and other kinase antagonists. SCLC, which accounts for approximately 15\u202f% of lung cancer cases, is a deadly high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with a poor prognosis. Limited-stage SCLC is confined to one hemi-thorax and one radiation port and extensive-stage disease signifies those cancers that do not meet the criteria for limited-stage disease. Local treatment options to control thoracic disease include radiotherapy and surgery. In patients with extensive-stage disease, a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) combined with etoposide and an anti-PDL1 inhibitor (atezolizumab or durvalumab) for four cycles followed by anti-PDL1 maintenance therapy is the recommended first-line regimen.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, the 3rd generation EGFR-TKI, has emerged as standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR mutated nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with exon 21 L858R mutation showed lower efficacy with EGFR-TKIs than those with 19Del mutation, even with osimertinib, it remains an unmet medical need to further improve the efficacy in L858R population. We present the rationale and design for FLAIR (NCT04988607), which will investigate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus osimertinib monotherapy in treatment-na\u00efve recurrent or metastatic NSCLC patients harboring EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation. FLAIR is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label study, which is initiated by Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group (CTONG2002). Patients age \u226518 years with primary recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who are treatment-na\u00efve with documented EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation is eligible. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive osimertinib 80 mg once daily plus bevacizumab 15mg/kg every 3 weeks or osimertinib monotherapy 80 mg once daily until progression or another discontinuation criterion is met. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include: overall survival rate at 24 months, time to treatment failure (TTF), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), central nervous system (CNS) PFS, CNS ORR and safety. FLAIR has completed the enrollment, and results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025 (depending on the actual event rate). This study will offer better perspectives on the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab combination therapy in treatment-na\u00efve recurrent or metastatic NSCLC patients harboring EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, providing valuable guidance for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "There has been significant improvement in treating metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) over the past 2 decades. The aim of this study is to describe the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Qatar. This study focuses on the objective response rate (ORR) and reported adverse drug events (ADEs) of TKIs used for the management of patients with mNSCLC. This is a descriptive retrospective cohort study. All non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations who received TKIs between 2015 and 2019 in Qatar were included. The TKIs used during this period include EGFR inhibitors such as afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and osimertinib and ALK inhibitors such as alectinib and crizotinib. The response on each TKI was identified by reporting the ORR (as the sum of the complete response [CR] and the partial response [PR]), in addition stable disease (SD) and disease progression (DP) were reported. While ADEs were reported using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). A total of 63 patients were included, of which 36 cases (57.1%) expressed EGFR mutation, and 27 patients (42.9%) expressed ALK rearrangement. The ORR in EGFR inhibitors was as follows: osimertinib 40%, gefitinib 33%, afatinib 22%, and erlotinib 18%. However, the response to the ALK-targeted therapy was 43% with alectinib and 40% with crizotinib. A total of 112 ADEs were reported. They were distributed as 63.4% (71 of 112) with the anti-EGFR and 36.6% (41 of 112) ADEs with the ALK inhibitors. In the anti-EGFR group, the most common types of ADEs were dermatological toxicity 30%, whereas, in the anti-ALK group, gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common (29%). The EGFR-targeted and ALK-targeted therapies appear to have acceptable clinical response rate and safety profile in our population. Close and frequent monitoring of adverse events is advised to ensure a good quality of life and prevent serious complications.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is approved as a standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation by FDA. However, the mechanisms of resistance for nearly half of patients after osimertinib progression are still unknown, and the optimal therapies for these patients are still controversial. In this retrospective study, we compared efficacy and safety between immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy, chemotherapy alone, and osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab in NSCLC patients after osimertinib progression with unknown resistance mechanisms. Advanced NSCLC patients with unknown resistance mechanisms after osimertinib progression were retrospectively reviewed and divided into immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy, chemotherapy alone, and osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab treatment groups according to the treatment they received after osimertinib progression. Clinicopathological features, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups. A total of 121 patients were enrolled in this study, 22 in the immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy group, 72 in the chemotherapy group, and 27 in the osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab group. The ORR was much higher in the immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy group compared with chemotherapy or osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab group (55.56% vs. 14.81% vs. 0% in patients after progression on 1st line osimertinib treatment; 30.77% vs. 6.67% vs. 13.33% in patients after progression on 2nd/3rd line osimertinib treatment). Median PFS was also significantly longer in the immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy group compared with other groups (8.2\u2009months vs. 4.0\u2009months vs. 6.0\u2009months in all patients, p\u2009=\u20090.0066). The median OS did not reach remarkable difference among groups, although osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab group had a numerically longer median OS (37.0\u2009months vs. 37.0\u2009months vs. 47.6\u2009months in all patients, p\u2009=\u20090.6357). Compared with immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy and chemotherapy, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab were milder, especially in AEs related to gastrointestinal and bone marrow suppression. Our study provides clinical evidence that NSCLC patients after osimertinib progression with unknown resistance mechanisms may benefit from immunotherapy\u2009+\u2009chemotherapy, with higher ORR and longer PFS compared with osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab or chemotherapy groups. Osimertinib\u2009+\u2009bevacizumab treatment was also an optional option for patients because OS was numerically longer and safer in this group.",

However, even the well-established EGFR inhibitors tend to promptly develop resistance over time. Moreover, strategies that could impede resistance development and be advantageous for both EGFR-Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive and mutant NSCLC patients are constrained. Based on the critical relationship between EGFR, c-MYC, and Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (K-Ras), simultaneous degradation of EGFR and Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) using \"Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs)\" could be a promising approach. PROTACs are emerging class of oncoprotein degraders but very challanging to deliver in vivo. Compared to individual IC50s, strong synergism was observed at 1:1 ratio of BPRO and EPRO in NSCLC cell lines with diverse mutation. Significant inhibition of cell growth with higher cellular apoptosis was observed in 2D and 3D-based cell assays in nanomolar concentrations. EGFR activation assay revealed 47.60\u00a0% EGFR non-expressing cells confirming EGFR-degrading potential of EPRO. A lung cancer specific nanoliposomal formulation of EGFR and BRD4-degrading PROTACs (EPRO and BPRO) was prepared and characetrized. Successful encapsulation of the two highly lipophilic molecules was achieved in EGFR-targeting nanoliposomal carriers (T-BEPRO) using a modified hydration technique. T-BEPRO revealed a particle size of 109.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.266\u00a0nm with enhanced cellular uptake and activity. Remarkably, parenterally delivered T-BEPRO in tumor-bearing mice showed a substantially higher % tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 77.6\u00a0% with long-lasting tumor inhibitory potential as opposed to individual drugs.",

Median duration of response was 9.0 (range, 4.2-22.3) months. Median progression-free and overall survivals were 2.7 and 9.3\u00a0months, respectively. Twenty-eight (100\u00a0%) plasma and/or 21 (75\u00a0%) histologic rebiopsies identified: 17 (61\u00a0%) TP53; 15 (54\u00a0%) T790M; 9 (32\u00a0%) uncommon EGFR; 9 (32\u00a0%) MET; 6 (21\u00a0%) C797S; 3 (11\u00a0%) BRAF; 2 (7\u00a0%) HER2; 2 (7\u00a0%) KRAS; and 2 (7\u00a0%) PI3K mutations. One (17\u00a0%) of 6 C797S patients showed complete response. Three (33\u00a0%) of 9 uncommon EGFR-mutated patients achieved radiographic response. Neither 15 T790M-positive nor 6 EGFR downstream signaling mutations: BRAF; KRAS; or PI3K-positive patients responded, but 5 (38\u00a0%) of 13 T790M-negative patients responded. Adverse events\u00a0\u2265\u00a0grade 3 and incidence\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0% were: hypertension (29\u00a0%); proteinuria (7\u00a0%); and diarrhea (7\u00a0%). There were neither treatment-related death nor interstitial lung disease. Selected population could obtain clinical benefit from afatinib plus bevacizumab, based on rebiopsy results after osimertinib resistance.",

In this phase 3 EVEREST trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03653546), patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations, advanced treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and non-irradiated symptomatic or asymptomatic CNS metastases were randomized (1:1) to zorifertinib or first-generation EGFR-TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib; control). The primary endpoint was blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST1.1. Overall, 439 patients were randomized (zorifertinib n\u00a0= 220; control n\u00a0= 219). Most patients had the EGFR L858R mutation (55%) or >3 CNS lesions (54%). Median PFS was significantly longer with zorifertinib versus control (9.6 versus 6.9\u00a0months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.719; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.580-0.893; p\u00a0= 0.0024). Zorifertinib significantly prolonged intracranial PFS versus control (BICR per modified RECIST1.1: HR, 0.467; 95% CI, 0.352-0.619; investigator per RANO-BM: HR, 0.627; 95% CI, 0.466-0.844). Overall survival (OS) was immature; the estimated median OS was 37.3\u00a0months with zorifertinib and 31.8\u00a0months with control (HR, 0.833; 95% CI, 0.524-1.283) in patients subsequently treated with third-generation EGFR-TKIs. Safety profiles were consistent with previously reported data for zorifertinib. Zorifertinib significantly improved systemic and intracranial PFS versus first-generation EGFR-TKIs; adverse events were manageable. Sequential use of zorifertinib and third-generation EGFR-TKIs showed the potential to prolong patients' survival. The results favor zorifertinib as a novel, well-validated first-line option for CNS-metastatic patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. This work was funded by Alpha Biopharma (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd., China.",

    "abstract": "Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations, with improved long-term outcomes compared to first-generation TKIs. Nevertheless, disease progression inevitably occurs, limiting osimertinib long-term efficacy. Indeed, the molecular biology underlying acquired resistance to first-line osimertinib is multifaceted and includes the emergence of on-target and off-target alterations. EGFR-C797S mutation represents the most frequent mechanism of on-target resistance and hinders drug binding to the target site. EGFR-independent resistance includes the activation of alternative signaling pathways, such as MET amplification and HER2 mutations, and histological transformation. In this setting, chemotherapy is the current therapeutic option, with modest clinical outcomes. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to osimertinib is a major challenge. In this setting, fourth-generation TKIs are emerging as an interesting therapeutic option to overcome on-target resistance. Preclinical drug development has led to the discovery of thiazole-amid inhibitors, which activity is mediated by the allosteric inhibition of EGFR, resulting in high specificity towards mutant-EGFR. Early phase 1/2 clinical trials are ongoing to elucidate their activity also in the clinical setting. Aim of this review is to provide a state-of-the-art analysis on preclinical development of fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs and promising preliminary clinical data.",

We retrospectively reviewed and compared data of 113 patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 2-4 who were administered OSI 80\u00a0mg/day or GEF 250\u00a0mg/day from May 2016 to March 2022.

    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) has been considered to mediate primary and acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, mechanisms underlying this process are not wholly clear and the effective therapeutic strategy remains to be determined. The gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines were induced by concentration increase method in vitro. Western blot and qPCR were used to investigate the relationship between MET and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathway. Double luciferase reporter gene and co-immunoprecipitation were used to further reveal the regulation mechanism between MET and VEGF/VEGFR2. The effect of combined inhibition of MET and VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway on the therapeutic sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in gefitinib resistant cell lines with MET aberration was verified ex vivo and in vivo. We successfully obtained two gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutation and abnormal activation of MET. We observed that MET formed a positive feedback loop with the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling, leading to persistent downstream signaling activation. Specifically, MET up-regulated VEGFR2 expression in a MAPK/ERK/ETS1-dependent manner, while VEGF promoted physical interaction between VEGFR2 and MET, thereby facilitating MET phosphorylation. A MET inhibitor, crizotinib, combined with an anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, enhanced the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib and synergistically inhibited the activation of downstream signaling in vitro. Dual inhibition of MET and VEGF combined with EGFR TKIs markedly restrained tumor growth in both human NSCLC xenograft models and in an EGFR/MET co-altered case. Our work reveals a positive feedback loop between MET and VEGF/VEGFR2, resulting in continuous downstream signal activation. Combined inhibition of MET and VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway may be beneficial for reversing EGFR TKIs resistance.",

In this study, we conduct a bibliometric analysis to elucidate evolving research hotspots and trends in EGFR-TKI resistance, offering insights for clinical interventions and scientific inquiries. Publications spanning from 1996 to 2024, focusing on EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC, were sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection. Utilizing VOSviewer 1.6.19, CiteSpace 6.2. R2, and Scimago Graphica 1.0.35, we analyzed these articles to identify countries/regions and institutions, Journals, publications, key contributors, collaborations, and emerging topics. An analysis of 8051 articles by 38,215 researchers from 86 countries shows growing interest in EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms. Since 1996, publications have steadily increased, surpassing 500 per year after 2016, with a sharp rise in citations. Research articles make up 84% of publications, emphasizing scholarly focus. Global collaboration, especially among researchers in China, the US, and Japan, is strong. Leading institutions like Dana-Farber and Harvard, along with journals such as \"Lung Cancer\", are key in sharing findings. Professors Yi-Long Wu and William Pao are prominent contributors. Keyword analysis reveals core themes, including first-generation EGFR-TKIs, emerging agents like osimertinib, and research on the T790M mutation. EGFR-TKI resistance remains a critical issue in NSCLC treatment, driving ongoing research efforts worldwide. Focusing future research on clear identification of resistance mechanisms will guide post-resistance treatment strategies, necessitating further exploration, alongside the validation of emerging drugs through clinical trials. Moreover, \"chemo+\" treatments following EGFR-TKI resistance require more clinical data and real-world evidence for assessing safety and patient outcomes. As research advances, a multidisciplinary approach will be key to overcoming these challenges. Continued innovation in treatment could greatly enhance patient survival and quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have emerged as a leading targeted cancer therapy, reducing the side effects often seen with non-targeted treatments, especially the damage to healthy cells. To tackle resistance, typically caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, four generations of TKIs have been developed. Each generation has shown improved effectiveness and fewer side effects, resulting in better patient outcomes. For example, patients on gefitinib, a first-generation TKI, experienced a progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 months compared to 5 months with conventional chemotherapy. Second-generation TKI afatinib outperformed erlotinib and extended PFS to 11.1 months compared to 6.9 months with cisplatin. Third-generation TKIs further increased survival to 38.6 months, compared to 31.8 months with first-generation TKIs. This progress demonstrates the ability of newer TKIs to overcome resistance, particularly the T790M mutation, while reducing adverse effects. Ongoing research focuses on overcoming resistance from newer mutations like C797S to further improve patient survival. These developments highlight the significant progress in TKI therapy and the continued effort to refine cancer treatment. Recent research in South Korea shows that third-generation TKIs are ineffective against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the C797S mutation. Several trials have started showing promising in vitro and in vivo results, but more trials are needed before clinical approval. This review underscores notable advancements in the field of EGFR TKIs, offering a comprehensive analysis of their mechanisms of action and the progression of various TKI generations in response to resistance.",

    "abstract": "Aumolertinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and a well-tolerated toxicity profile compared to gefitinib in front-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the AENEAS trial. However, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of aumolertinib have not been published. In this real-world study, the efficacy was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0. PROs were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) and the EORTC Quality of Life lung cancer-specific module (QLQ-LC13) in advanced NSCLC patients receiving aumolertinib as initial therapy. Pre-specified key symptoms were cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, sore mouth or tongue, dysphagia, hair loss, tingling in hands or feet, chest pain, arm or shoulder pain, and pain at other sites. A total of 33 patients were included, 23 of whom had efficacy information up to January 2024. The median follow-up time was 264 days (interval: 36-491 days). The objective response rate and disease control rate were 65.2% and 91.3%, respectively. The EORTC QLQ-LC30 general health status scale showed that functional scales increased and symptom scales decreased during aumolertinib treatment. Symptom scales assessed by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 showed that improvements in cough, sore mouth or tongue, tingling in hands or feet, chest pain, arm or shoulder pain, and other pain sites were both clinically and statistically significant after 6 months of aumolertinib treatment ( In this real-world study, aumolertinib showed comparable disease control and objective response rates as reported in the AENEAS trial for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations. Aumolertinib treatment improved PROs, further supporting it in first-line clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Despite targeted therapies like epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a clinical challenge due to drug resistance hampering their efficacy. Here, we designed an \"AND\" logic gate-based supramolecular therapeutic platform (HA-BPY-GEF-NPs) for the treatment of EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC. This system integrates both internal and external stimuli-responsive mechanisms that need to be activated in a preset sequence, enabling it to precisely control drug release behavior for enhancing therapeutic precision. By programming the system to respond to sequential near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and enzyme (cathepsin B) inputs, the release of gefitinib is effectively confined to the tumor region. Moreover, the NIR irradiation induces reactive oxygen species production, suppressing tumor growth and inhibiting bypass signaling pathways. The designed drug delivery system offers a highly controlled and targeted therapeutic approach, effectively inhibiting tumor growth, suppressing bypass signaling pathways, and overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance, thus offering a potential solution for maximizing therapeutic benefits.",

    "abstract": "Genomic alterations after resistance to osimertinib therapy in advanced T790M-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are complex and poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to detect these genomic alternations via comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue and liquid biopsies. From September 2020 to June 2021, 31 stage IIIB/IV T790M-mutated NSCLC patients who exhibited progressive disease after osimertinib therapy and provided written informed consent were recruited. Liquid and tissue biopsy samples for NGS testing were collected from 31 and 18 patients, respectively. Eighteen study patients had paired NGS data from tissue and liquid biopsies. With respect to the T790M mutation status, the preservation and loss rates were 33% and 67%, respectively, in both liquid and tissue biopsy samples. Five patients (16.1%) had the C797S mutation (4 liquid samples and 1 tissue sample). Two (6.5%) had MET mutations, 3 (9.7%) had BRAF-V600E mutations, and 1 (3.2%) had a KRAS-G12C mutation. Among the 18 patients who underwent tissue rebiopsies, those with preserved T790M mutation had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) with osimertinib therapy than those with T790M mutation loss (10.8 vs. 5.0\u00a0months, P\u2009=\u20090.045). Among all patients, those with T790M mutation loss in liquid biopsy samples had longer PFS after osimertinib therapy (10.8 vs. 7.5\u00a0months, P\u2009=\u20090.209) and postprogression survival (17.7 vs. 9.6\u00a0months, P\u2009=\u20090.132) than those with preserved T790M mutation based on liquid biopsies. NGS using either tissue or liquid biopsy samples from advanced T790M-mutated NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib therapy can detect various genomic alternations. Future studies focusing on subsequent tailored therapies on the basis of NGS results are warranted.",

While it is generally well tolerated, milder side effects of diarrhea, cytopenia, and cutaneous rashes are common. Osimertinib-induced myositis and rhabdomyolysis are exceedingly rare, and only a few cases have been documented in the literature to date. In this report, we present a case of a 59-year-old female with metastatic NSCLC who experienced myalgia following the initiation of osimertinib. Blood work revealed elevated creatine kinase (CK), serum creatinine (Cr), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Initially, her myalgia improved, and lab work normalized after drug discontinuation and supportive care. However, rechallenge with a 50% dose resulted in recurrence of symptoms and elevated serum CK, Cr, ALT, and AST. MRI findings suggested diffuse inflammation and a muscle biopsy revealed necrotizing myopathy. Symptoms ameliorated upon complete cessation of the drug and use of steroids. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this rare adverse effect of osimertinib and a guide for managing these associated symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-nuclear factor erythroid- 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway is a major regulator protecting cells from oxidative and metabolic stress. Studies have revealed that this pathway is involved in mediating resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunotherapy; however, its implications in oncogene-addicted tumors are largely unknown. This study aimed to elucidate whether this pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. We measured the baseline expression of NRF2 using EGFR-mutant parental cells and acquired gefitinib resistant cells. We investigated whether NRF2 inhibition affected cell death in vitro and tumor growth in vivo using a xenograft mouse model, and compared the transcriptional changes before and after NRF2 inhibition. Baseline NRF2 expression was enhanced in PC9 and PC9 with gefitinib resistance (PC9/GR) cells than in other cell lines, with a more prominent expression in PC9/ GR. The NRF2 inhibitor induced NRF2 downregulation and cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Cotreatment with an NRF2 inhibitor enhanced osimertinib-induced cell death in vitro, and potentiated tumor growth inhibition in a PC9/GR xenograft model. Finally, RNA sequencing revealed that NRF2 inhibition resulted in the altered expression of multiple genes involved in various signaling pathways. We identified that NRF2 inhibition enhanced cell death and inhibited tumor growth in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant lung cancer with EGFR-mutation. Thus, NRF2 modulation may be a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

Telomere maintenance via telomerase reactivation is linked to uncontrolled cell growth and is a cancer hallmark and an attractive cancer therapeutic target. Our effort toward understanding the action mechanisms, including resistance mechanisms, of osimertinib has led to the identification of a novel and critical role in maintaining c-Myc-dependent downregulation of hTERT, a catalytic subunit of telomerase, and subsequent inhibition of telomerase/telomere and induction of telomere dysfunction in mediating therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib. Consequently, osimertinib combined with the telomere inhibitor, 6-Thio-dG, which is currently tested in a phase II trial, effectively inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumors, regressed EGFRm NSCLC patient-derived xenografts, and delayed the emergence of acquired resistance to osimertinib, warranting clinical validation of this strategy to manage osimertinib acquired resistance.",

However, its superiority in terms of overall survival in the Asian population, especially Japanese patients, remains uncertain. To evaluate the survival benefit of\u00a0osimertinib over other EGFR-TKIs in Japanese patients, using real-world data. METHODS\u00a0: As part of the Tokushukai REAl-world Data project, a retrospective multi-institutional study across 46 hospitals in Japan was conducted to evaluate the overall survival of patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer using propensity score matching. The study involved patients receiving osimertinib as the first-line treatment (1L-Osi), those initially treated with other EGFR-TKIs (1L-non-Osi), and those receiving osimertinib after initial EGFR-TKI treatment (2L/later-Osi) between April 2010 and December 2022 and followed up until April 2023. Among 1062 Japanese patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, 416 (39.2%) received 1L-Osi, while 646 (60.8%) received 1L-non-Osi, including 139 (13.1%) who received 2L/later-Osi. Within these groups, 416 (39.2%), 293 (27.6%), and 75 (7.1%) patients received first-line EGFR-TKI treatment post-osimertinib approval as a later-line treatment in Japan (March 2016). After propensity score matching, the overall survival of the 1L-Osi group was comparable to that of the 1L-non-Osi group in the post-March 2016 subset (n = 283, 42.0 vs 42.4 months). Similar trends were observed in the Del19 and L858R subgroups. The median overall survival of the 2L/later-Osi group was notably long: 60.2 months post-March 2016 (n = 75). A subgroup analysis based on initial EGFR-TKI treatment in the 1L-non-Osi and 2L/later-Osi groups revealed no significant differences among the gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib groups. Based on real-world data, osimertinib did not show a significant improvement in overall survival compared to other EGFR-TKIs as a first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the Japanese (Asian) population.

Among these, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC remains the predominant oncogenic mutation, particularly prevalent in regions such as Asia and Latin America. This case study highlights the experience of a woman diagnosed with EGFR-sensitive (del exon 19) mutant NSCLC who demonstrated an extended duration of response to third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Upon disease progression, detection of MET gene amplification prompted the addition of a selective MET inhibitor to the existing EGFR-TKI regimen, resulting in a complete response for the patient. The molecular heterogeneity of this condition has significantly increased in complexity over recent years, marked by the identification of baseline co-alterations and development of a broad spectrum of resistance mechanisms post-EGFR-TKI therapy. This complexity poses a substantial challenge to clinicians. Despite the rapid advancement of targeted therapies and the implementation of treatment escalation through combination strategies, there remains an ongoing debate regarding which patients would benefit most from combination therapies, both in the initial treatment phase and in the setting of disease progression, particularly when off-target resistance mechanisms or co-alterations are identified.",

Patients without progression during/following definitive platinum-based CRT were randomised 2 : 1 to receive osimertinib (80 mg daily) or placebo until progression [by blinded independent central review (BICR)] or discontinuation. The primary endpoint was PFS by BICR. CNS PFS by neuroradiologist BICR and TTDM by BICR were secondary endpoints. Overall, 216 patients were randomised (143 osimertinib, 73 placebo). Median CNS PFS by neuroradiologist BICR was not reached [95% confidence interval (CI) not calculable (NC)-NC] with osimertinib versus 14.9 months (95% CI 7.4 months-NC) with placebo; hazard ratio (HR) for CNS PFS: 0.17 (95% CI 0.09-0.32). CNS PFS analysis by investigator assessment was consistent with BICR assessment. The cumulative incidence of CNS progression at 12 months was 9% (95% CI 5% to 14%) with osimertinib and 36% (95% CI 24% to 47%) with placebo. There was clinically meaningful improvement in TTDM with osimertinib versus placebo; HR for TTDM: 0.21 (95% CI 0.11-0.38). The cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 12 months was 11% (95% CI 6% to 17%) with osimertinib and 37% (95% CI 26% to 48%) with placebo. Osimertinib demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in CNS PFS and TTDM versus placebo, supporting osimertinib post-CRT as the standard of care in unresectable stage III EGFRm NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is known for its high efficacy against brain metastases (BM) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. This study aims to evaluate the use of brain MRI radiomics in predicting the intracranial efficacy to osimertinib in NSCLC patients with BM. This study analyzed 115 brain metastases from NSCLC patients with the EGFR-T790M mutation treated with second-line osimertinib. The primary endpoint was intracranial response, and the secondary endpoint was intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS). We performed tumor delineation, image preprocessing, and radiomics feature extraction. Using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy, we built radiomic models with eight feature selectors and eight machine learning classifiers. The models' performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. The dataset of 115 brain metastases was divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. The radiomic model utilizing the mRMR feature selector and stepwise logistic regression classifier showed the highest predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.879 for the training cohort and 0.786 for the validation cohort. This model outperformed a clinical-MRI morphological model, which included age, ring enhancement, and peritumoral edema (AUC: 0.794 for the training cohort and 0.697 for the validation cohort). The radiomic model also showed strong performance in calibration and decision curve analyses. Using a radiomic-score threshold of 199, patients were classified into two groups with significantly different median iPFS (3.0\u2009months vs. 15.4\u2009months,  This study demonstrates that MRI radiomics can effectively predict the intracranial efficacy of osimertinib in NSCLC patients with brain metastases. This approach holds promise for assisting clinicians in personalizing treatment strategies.",

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the complex molecular pathways of EGFR-mediated autophagy signaling in NSCLC. We identified naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene, an anthraquinolone derivative, to be a promising investigational drug that targets EGFR-mediated autophagy using a cellular model system. By utilizing systems biology, we developed a computational model that explained the signaling of EGFR-mediated autophagy and identified critical crosstalk sites that could be inhibited therapeutically. As a lead compound, naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene was confirmed by molecular docking experiments. It was found to be cytotoxic to NSCLC cells, impact migration, induce apoptosis, and arrest cell cycle, both on its own and when combined with standard drugs. The anticancer efficacy of naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene was validated in vivo on CDX nude mice. It showed synergistic activity against NSCLC when coupled with gefitinib, chloroquine, and radiation. Altogether, our study highlights naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene's therapeutic promise in NSCLC by focusing on EGFR-mediated autophagy and providing a new strategy to fight drug resistance and tumor survival.",

However, few cases have reported malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Here, we report a case of recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF) and Torsade de Pointes (TdP) secondary to QT prolongation and heart failure induced by osimertinib. A 70-year-old woman presented with chest tightness and dyspnea for 1 week and ventricular fibrillation upon admission, with a medical history of lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon 21 p.L858R mutation. She was under osimertinib for 3 months. Electrocardiography after defibrillation suggested QTc prolongation (655\u2005ms) and T wave alternans. Ultrasound cardiography displayed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 29% and severe mitral regurgitation. Laboratory tests indicated elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and hypokalemia. Genetic testing suggested no pathogenic mutations. We considered acquired long QT syndrome and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction induced by osimertinib as the chief causes of ventricular arrhythmia and hypokalemia as an important trigger. Despite intubation, sedation, and the administration intravenous magnesium and potassium and lidocaine, the patient presented with recurrent TdP, which was managed by a low dose of isoproterenol (ISO, 0.17\u2005ug/min). An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was declined. The patient is surviving without any relapse, with QTc of 490\u2005ms and LVEF of 42% after a 6-month follow up. Regular monitoring is required during osimertinib administration, considering the risk of life-threatening cardiac events, such as malignant arrhythmias and heart failure. ISO, with an individual dose and target heart rate, may be beneficial for terminating TdP during poor response to other therapies.",

    "abstract": "Some of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases enhance somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene within the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) domain. In such cases, first-line treatments are EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to assess the safety and efficacy of first-line targeted therapies for EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC patients, focusing on osimertinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib. A systematic electronic search was conducted on 3 electronic databases-Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science-from inception to May 2024 to locate relevant trials reporting the safety and efficacy of osimertinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib in treating EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. No language or data restriction was applied to the search strategy. The assessed effects were objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RoB 2 tool was utilized to determine the risk of bias while R programming language performed all the statistical synthesis. Out of 15,275 search results, only 19 trials were eligible for this meta-analysis. All the 3 EGFR-TKIs depicted effectiveness and safety among NSCLC patients, but osimertinib improved the ORR by 72% (95% CI: 65%, 78%) as compared with erlotinib (69% [95% CI: 58%, 79%]) and gefitinib (64% [95% CI: 64%, 78%]). Overall, the 3 EGFR-TKIs were effective by improving ORR 68% (95% CI: 63%, 73%). Similarly, osimertinib demonstrated highly effective impacts in disease control among NSCLC patients by 94% (95% CI: 91%, 97%) compared with gefitinib (68% [95% CI: 41%, 89%]). Overall, the 2 EGFR-TKIs were effective in disease control among NSCLC patients (82% [95% CI: 67%, 93%]). The pooled analyses have shown that erlotinib, gefitinib, and osimertinib are safe and effective first-line treatment options for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. The meta-analysis outcomes have demonstrated that osimertinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib positively impact overall response rate and disease control.",

This study was conducted as an exploratory analysis of a retrospective observational study that investigated the real-world data of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in Japan (CSPOR-LC03). Between 2008 and 2013, 1812 patients with completely resected adenocarcinoma diagnosed as pathologic stage I (T1\u00a0>\u00a02\u00a0cm, TNM classification, sixth edition) who have maintained organ function, and no history of other cancers were included. The primary endpoint was the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and we compared this rate between four groups classified based on the administration of adjuvant UFT and EGFR mutation status. Of the 933 (51%) patients with EGFR mutations, 394 underwent adjuvant UFT therapy. Of the 879 (49%) patients without EGFR mutations, 393 underwent adjuvant UFT therapy. The 5-year DFS of UFT+/EGFR+ and UFT-/EGFR+ patients were 82.0 and 87.1%, respectively, and those of UFT+/EGFR- and UFT-/EGFR- patients were 80.0 and 86.9%, respectively. DFS was significantly worse in the UFT+ group than in the UFT- group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Adjuvant UFT therapy was not an independent prognostic factor for DFS, regardless of the EGFR mutation status. In pathologic stage I (>2\u00a0cm) lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutation, the survival benefit of adjuvant UFT was not observed.",

We evaluated post-recurrence overall survival (PRS) and postoperative overall survival (POS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and identify any associations between the clinical variables at recurrence and PRS using univariate and multivariate analysis. We enrolled 162 patients. The median observation time for PRS was 4.95\u2009years (range, 0.82-13.25) and POS was 5.81\u2009years (range, 2.84-16.71).

A molecular docking model suggested that DB interacts with these kinases in the ATP-binding pockets. DB induces ROS generation and cell cycle arrest. DB treatment of HCC827 cells leads to mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The induction of apoptosis through caspase activation was confirmed by Z-VAD-FMK treatment. Taken together, DB inhibited the growth of both GEF-sensitive and GEF-resistant NSCLC cells by targeting EGFR, MET, and AKT and inducing ROS generation and caspase activation. Further studies on DB can improve the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC through the development of effective DB-based anticancer agents.",

    "abstract": "Transformation from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is rare and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the standard treatment protocols for patients with SCLC transformation remain unknown. Here, we report the case of a patient with advanced EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del) NSCLC who underwent SCLC transformation during targeted therapy. Biopsies and genetic testing were performed to adjust treatment regimens accordingly. The patient responded favorably to a combined treatment regimen comprising etoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy and adebrelimab plus osimertinib. This case highlights the critical importance of acknowledging tumor heterogeneity in clinical decision-making and identifying potentially effective treatment options for patients with SCLC transformation. Additionally, we reviewed cases of the transformation of NSCLC to SCLC from 2017 to 2023.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the standard treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations. Although the frequency of osimertinib-induced interstitial lung disease (osi-ILD) is high, the optimal cancer treatment after osi-ILD has not been established. This time, we focused on the safety and efficacy of gefitinib following osi-ILD. We experienced six cases (five women and one man; median age: 74 years) in which gefitinib was administered after osi-ILD. All six cases had grade 2 or higher osi-ILD and required steroid treatment. The computed tomography imaging pattern of osi-ILD revealed organizing pneumonia in three cases, diffuse alveolar damage in two cases, and hypersensitivity pneumonia in one case. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 in four cases, 2 in one case, and 3 in one case. EGFR mutation status was exon 19 deletion in two cases and exon 21 L858R in four cases. Only one patient experienced recurrence of ILD after receiving gefitinib. The best response to gefitinib was partial response in two cases and stable disease in three cases; one case was not evaluable. The median progression-free survival after treatment with gefitinib was 190 days (95% confidence interval: 33-328). The treatment with gefitinib after the development of osi-ILD was safe and effective. Gefitinib may be a promising option for patients who recovered from severe osi-ILD.",

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance is inevitable in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with osimertinib, and one of the primary mechanisms responsible for this resistance is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We identify upregulation of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) and functional inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) as drivers of EMT-associated osimertinib resistance. Upregulation of PIM1 promotes the growth, invasion, and resistance of osimertinib-resistant cells and is significantly correlated with EMT molecules expression. Functionally, PIM1 suppresses the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAIL) and snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SLUG) by deactivating GSK3\u03b2 through phosphorylation. The stability and accumulation of SNAIL and SLUG facilitate EMT and encourage osimertinib resistance. Furthermore, treatment with PIM1 inhibitors prevents EMT progression and re-sensitizes osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells to osimertinib. PIM1/GSK3\u03b2 signaling is activated in clinical samples of osimertinib-resistant NSCLC, and dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PIM1 blockade synergistically reverse osimertinib-resistant NSCLC in vivo. These data identify PIM1 as a driver of EMT-associated osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells and predict that PIM1 inhibitors and osimertinib combination therapy will provide clinical benefit in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC.",

To overcome the antagonism between Cis and Gef in anti-NSCLC therapy, here we demonstrated a self-targeted hyaluronan (HA) nanogel to facilitate the anticancer co-delivery by utilizing the HA's intrinsic targeting towards CD44, a receptor frequently overexpressed on lung cancer cells. The co-assembly between HA, Cis and Gef generated a HA/Cis/Gef nanogel of 177.8\u00a0nm, featuring a prolonged drug release. Unlike the Gef inhibited the Cis uptake, the HA/Cis/Gef nanogel efficiently facilitated the drug internalization through CD44-targeted delivery as verified by HA competition and CD44 knocking down in H1975 NSCLC model both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HA/Cis/Gef nanogel significantly improved the anticancer efficacy and meanwhile diminished the side effects in reference to the combination of free Cis and Gef. This CD44-targeted HA/Cis/Gef nanogel provided a potent strategy to advance the platinum-based combination therapy towards optimized NSCLC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as icotinib, osimertinib, and aumolertinib have emerged as promising treatment options for EGFR mutated Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Additionally, anlotinib, an anti-angiogenic agent targeting VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR, has been used in combination with EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cases. A method utilizing ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed and validated for quantifying icotinib, osimertinib, aumolertinib and anlotinib simultaneously in clinical TDM. The chromatographic separation was performed using a Kinetex C18 column (100\u202fmm \u00d7 2.1\u202fmm) and an elution gradient of ammonium acetate in water acidified with 0.1\u202f% formic acid and in acetonitrile. The assay was validated over a linear range of 4-2000\u202fng/mL for icotinib, 2-1000\u202fng/mL for osimertinib, 1-500\u202fng/mL for aumolertinib, and 0.8-400\u202fng/mL for anlotinib, following the guidelines on bioanalytical methods by FDA. The quantification method exhibited satisfactory performance in terms of selectivity, accuracy (from 91.3\u202f% to 107\u202f%), precision (intra- and inter-day coeffficients of variation ranged from 0.944\u202f% to 7.48\u202f%), linearity, recovery (from 86.0\u202f% to 91.9\u202f%), matrix effect (IS-normalized matrix factors were from 96.7\u202f% to 102\u202f%), and stability. Overall, the method proved to be sensitive, reliable, and straightforward, enabling successful simultaneous determination of blood concentrations of icotinib, osimertinib, aumolertinib, and anlotinib in patients. The validity of the method has been confirmed across various instruments.",

    "abstract": "First-line osimertinib plus chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival of patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to osimertinib, according to the FLAURA2 trial. We established a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib plus chemotherapy with that of osimertinib alone. Clinical data were obtained from the FLAURA and FLAURA2 trials, and additional data were extracted from online resources and publications. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the findings. We used A willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The main outcomes were QALYs, overall costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net monetary benefit, and incremental net health benefit. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to patients' mutation type and central nervous system (CNS) metastatic status. In a 20-year time horizon, the ICER of osimertinib plus chemotherapy versus osimertinib alone was $223,727.1 per QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses identified the cost of osimertinib and the hazard ratio for overall survival as the top 2 influential factors and a 1.9% probability of osimertinib plus chemotherapy to be cost-effective. The subgroup analyses revealed ICERs of $132,614.1, $224,449.8, $201,464.1, and $130,159.7 per QALY gained for L858R mutations, exon 19 deletions, CNS metastases, and no CNS metastases subgroups, respectively. From the perspective of the United States health care system, osimertinib plus chemotherapy is not cost-effective compared to osimertinib alone for treatment-na\u00efve patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, but more favorable cost-effectiveness occurs in patients with L858R mutations and patients without baseline CNS metastases.",

Osimertinib, an approved therapy for metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutations, highlights remarkable efficacy but also harbors the potential for severe adverse events, whose rarity or lack of precedence may mask their criticality. This article delves into the exploration of adverse events linked to osimertinib, shedding light on a rare yet life-threatening occurrence: severe myelosuppression. A case study detailing a patient with EGFR-mutated NSCLC exhibiting a robust treatment response but experiencing severe myelosuppression following osimertinib initiation is presented. Immediate discontinuation of osimertinib alongside concurrent blood transfusions facilitated toxicity recovery, prompting a successful reduction in myelosuppression severity upon re-administration at a lowered dosage.",

This study aimed to investigate the role of HDAC1/FOXK1/miR-33a signaling in EGFR-TKI resistance. The expression levels of miR-33a, HDAC1, and FOXK1 were examined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bioinformatics analysis. Cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were explored by cell number assay, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays, respectively. After overexpression or knockdown of HDAC1, miR-33a expression in the cells, cell functions were tested. Immunoprecipitation and correlation analyses were used to evaluate the interaction between HDAC1 and FOXK1 protein. The tumor-suppressive role of miR-33a was investigated by animal experiments. The suppression of miR-33a increased TKI resistance by affecting cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant cells. HDAC1 is the key upstream molecule that inhibits miR-33 expression. HDAC1 upregulation increased gefitinib resistance by its binding to FOXK1 in cells to silence miR-33a expression. MiR-33a overexpression exerts tumor-suppressive effects by negatively regulating ABCB7 and p70S6K1 expression. Moreover, overexpression of miR-33a inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model. HDAC1/FOXK1 upregulation and miR-33a silencing are new mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC.",

We aimed to investigate the relationship between patient characteristics, EGFR genotype, therapeutic agents, and the prognosis of the patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 198 Japanese patients with unresectable EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer who were treated with EGFR-TKIs at Toho University Sakura Medical Center from April 2006 to December 2021. Factors associated with overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Patients who received osimertinib had a significantly longer OS than did those not receiving it (median OS, 36.2 versus 20.7 months; p < 0.001).There were significant differences in OS between patients with EGFR mutation who received osimertinib as first-line treatment, T790M-positive patients who received osimertinib as second- or later-line treatment, and those who did not receive it (median OS, 28.2 versus 40.2 versus 20.7 months; p = 0.003). However, in T790M-negative patients, no significant difference in OS was noted between those who did and did not receive osimertinib as post-treatment (median OS, 28.0 versus 40.0 months; p = 0.619). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that osimertinib treatment was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.480; 95% confidence interval, 0.326-0.707; p < 0.001). The patients who were T790M-positive in the first-line treatment with first or second-generation EGFR-TKIs and were given osimertinib as the second or later line treatment had a better prognosis than the patients who were T790M-negative in the first-line treatment with first or second-generation EGFR-TKIs and could not receive osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages prevail in the microenvironment of several tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where they secrete pro-tumorigenic factors that contribute to cancer progression. This study investigated the role of macrophages on the resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR-mutated cell lines PC-9 and HCC827 were cocultured with macrophages and treated with TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib). The effects of the macrophage-conditioned medium (macrophage CM) on gefitinib resistance and cell migration were also evaluated. Co-culture with macrophages significantly enhanced the resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib in PC-9 and HCC827 cells compared to that in cells cultured independently. Macrophage CM markedly induced gefitinib resistance in PC-9 cells, with maximum resistance observed at 50% CM concentration. This resistance persisted for up to 48 h post-CM removal. Macrophage CM inhibited gefitinib-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3, PARP, and BIM. Additionally, macrophage CM increased the migration ability of PC-9 cells, as shown by the wound healing and transwell migration assays. Studies have shown that TonEBP is crucial in cancer metastasis and drug resistance; we found that inhibition of TonEBP/NFAT5 expression reduced gefitinib resistance and migration in macrophage CM-induced PC-9 cells, indicating its role as mediator of these effects. Macrophages contribute to TKI resistance and enhance the migration of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells through mechanisms involving TonEBP/NFAT5. Therefore, targeting TonEBP/NFAT5 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming macrophage-induced TKI resistance in NSCLC cells.",

In our study cohort, we found that the overall survival rates for real-world patients receiving osimertinib were less favorable than those observed in clinical trials (24.0 versus 38.6 months). The attrition rate after osimertinib was substantial and high HCRU persisted across many years after diagnosis and treatment. This study provides important real-world evidence on contemporary survival, treatment patterns, and healthcare use among cEGFRm NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib and suggests that further research efforts are needed to improve therapeutic options in both the first and subsequent line settings.",

Fifty-three patients received 1st/\u200a2nd generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and 13\u00a0received either 3rd generation TKI (osimertinib) or chemotherapy plus gefitinib. The baseline ct-DNA-positive group had more patients with extra thoracic disease (60.4\u00a0vs. 48.5%). For the entire cohort, there was no difference in median progression-free survival (PFS) among baseline ct-DNA-negative (13.57\u00a0months) vs. ct-DNA-positive patients (12.32\u00a0months) (HR 0.74). There was a\u00a0significant improvement of PFS among early ct-DNA clearers vs. non-clearers (12.32\u00a0vs. 9.92\u00a0months; HR 0.57). For those treated with 1st/\u200a2nd generation EGFR TKIs, this improvement in median PFS among early ct-DNA clearers vs. non-clearers was more apparent (11.76\u00a0vs. 6.8\u00a0months; HR 0.34). Baseline detection of the presence of ct-DNA of EGFR mutation in plasma was not predictive of first-line PFS, but is associated with extra thoracic disease. Patients with EGFR mutation and persistence of ct-DNA at first follow-up have worse PFS and overall survival (OS) in comparison to those clearing the same in plasma, especially among those treated with 1st/\u200a2nd generation EGFR TKIs.",

    "abstract": "For patients treated with osimertinib as first-line therapy, there have been no studies comparing both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) according to performance status (PS). Furthermore, no studies have examined differences in baseline genetic abnormalities between patients with poor and good PS. Therefore, we aimed to investigate differences in baseline genetic abnormalities and treatment effects between patients with poor and good PS who received osimertinib as the primary treatment. This is a secondary analysis of the ELUCIDATOR study, which is a multi-center prospective observational study in Japan that assessed mechanisms underlying resistance to osimertinib as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. There were 153 and 25 patients in the good and poor PS groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in PFS (hazards ratio [HR]: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-1.72, p\u2009=\u20090.946). Multivariate analysis of OS revealed that poor PS was a poor prognostic factor (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.43-4.73, p\u2009=\u20090.003). Regarding baseline genetic abnormalities, there was a significant increase in APC-positive cases (20.0% vs. 2.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and a trend toward more CTNNB1-positive cases in the poor PS group than in the good PS group (14.3% vs. 2.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.062). There was no between-group difference in PFS, although OS was significantly inferior in the poor PS group. Additionally, there was a significant increase in APC-positive cases and a trend toward more CTNNB1-positive cases in the poor PS group.",

    "abstract": "MS4A3 functions as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types. However, the roles of MS4A3 in lung cancer are still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the potentials of MS4A3 in lung cancer. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was carried out to determine mRNA expression. CCK-8 and colony formation assay are conducted to determine cell proliferation. Tube formation assay is performed to determine angiogenesis. Flow cytometry is used to determine cell apoptosis. JASPAR is used to analyze the binding motif of THAP1. Luciferase and ChIP assay are conducted to verify whether MS4A3 can interact with THAP1 to transcriptionally inactivate EGFR. The results showed that MS4A3 is downregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, which predicts poor clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients. Overexpressed MS4A3 enhances the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells to osimertinib, whereas MS4A3 knockdown exerts the opposite effects. MS4A3 suppresses the proliferation and angiogenesis and promotes the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Moreover, MS4A3 upregulates apoptosis-related THAP1 to inactivate EGFR. However, THAP1 knockdown attenuates the effects of MS4A3 and promotes the malignant behavior of NSCLC cells. In conclusion, MS4A3 functions as an anti-tumor gene in NSCLC. MS4A3/THAP1/EGFR signaling enhances the chemosensitivity of lung cancer to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85 % of all lung cancers. In NSCLC, 10-20 % of Caucasian patients and 30-50 % of Asian patients have tumors with activating mutations in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). A high percentage of these patients exhibit favorable responses to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Unfortunately, a majority of these patients develop therapeutic resistance with progression free survival lasting 9-18 months. The mechanisms that underlie the tumorigenic effects of EGFR and the ability of NSCLC to develop resistance to TKI therapies, however, are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is produced by EGFR activation of normal epithelial cells, transformed epithelial cells with wild type EGFR and cells with cancer-associated, activating EGFR mutations. We also demonstrate that CHI3L1 auto-induces itself and feeds back to stimulate EGFR and its ligands via a STAT3-dependent mechanism(s). Highly specific antibodies against CHI3L1 (anti-CHI3L1/FRG) and TKI, individually and in combination, abrogated the effects of EGFR activation on CHI3L1 and the ability of CHI3L1 to stimulate the EGFR axis. Anti-CHI3L1 also interacted with osimertinib to reverse TKI therapeutic resistance and induce tumor cell death and inhibit pulmonary metastasis while stimulating tumor suppressor genes including KEAP1. CHI3L1 is a downstream target of EGFR that feeds back to stimulate and activate the EGFR axis. Anti-CHI3L1 is an exciting potential therapeutic for EGFR mutant NSCLC, alone and in combination with osimertinib or other TKIs.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of lung cancer has made dramatic progress in the past decade, but due to the high cost of drugs, the total pharmaceutical cost has been rising explosively. There are currently no data available in Japan on which regimens are used, to what extent they are used, and what their total cost is. Sixty Japanese centers belonging to the Lung Cancer Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group were surveyed for information about the first-line treatment for advanced lung cancer in practice from July 2021 to June 2022. Three types of cancer were included: driver gene mutation-negative NSCLC, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Recent treatment costs for ICIs or ICI plus chemotherapy were about 20-55 times higher than those for conventional chemotherapy. Of the 3738 patients with driver gene aberration-negative NSCLC, 2573 (68.8%) received treatments with monthly cost of 500\u2009000 Japanese yen (JPY) or more; 2555 (68.4%) received ICI therapy. Of the 1486 patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, 1290 (86.8%) received treatments with a monthly cost of 500\u2009000 JPY or more; 1207 (81.2%) received osimertinib. ICI treatments with a monthly cost of 500\u2009000 JPY or more were administered to 607 (56.3%) of 1079 patients with ES-SCLC. Elderly NSCLC patients received slightly more high-cost treatment than younger patients. Recent treatments cost many times more than conventional chemotherapy. This study revealed that high-cost treatments were widely used in advanced lung cancer and some of high-cost treatments were used despite the lack of clear evidence. Physicians should pay attention to the cost of treatments they use.",

    "abstract": "EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-activating mutations in the first-line setting. Despite initial efficacy, resistance to EGFR-TKIs often develops, and platinum-based chemotherapy is the predominant subsequent treatment. For this study, we aimed to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving platinum-pemetrexed after progression on EGFR-TKIs. Our analysis specifically focuses on 1st-line treatments limited to 1st- or 2nd-generation EGFR-TKIs, while not restricting later-line treatments involving osimertinib prior to chemotherapy. From 2012 to 2017, 363 patients who received first-line treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib were enrolled. Some patients received different EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib, as later-line treatment before platinum-pemetrexed. Median OS from the initiation of platinum-pemetrexed was 22.0 months and median PFS with platinum-pemetrexed was 6.2 months. In the multivariate Cox model, we identified three independent prognostic factors for better OS: postoperative recurrence (HR: 0.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), first-line EGFR-TKI PFS \u226512 months (HR: 0.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and osimertinib treatment after platinum-pemetrexed (HR: 0.56, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) while BMI <18.5 indicated poor prognosis (HR:1.76, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). No statistically significant independent prognostic factors for PFS were found. Receiving osimertinib before platinum-pemetrexed treatment did not impact PFS with platinum-pemetrexed treatment (HR: 1.11, p\u00a0=\u00a00.64). Postoperative recurrence, first-line EGFR-TKI PFS \u226512 months and osimertinib treatment after platinum-pemetrexed predicted better OS, while BMI <18.5 predicted worse OS. Osimertinib treatment before platinum-pemetrexed treatment did not affect the efficacy of platinum-pemetrexed.",

However, transcriptomic changes between NSCLC and transformed SCLC (t-SCLC) remain unexplored. We conducted whole-transcriptome analysis of 59 regions of interest through the spatial profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from 10 patients (lung adenocarcinoma, 22; combined SCLC/NSCLC, 7; and t-SCLC, 30 regions of interests). Transcriptomic profiles and differentially expressed genes were compared between pre- and post-transformed tumors. Following EGFR-TKI treatment, 93.7% (15/16) of t-SCLC components evolved into neuroendocrine-high subtypes (SCLC-A or SCLC-N). The transition to t-SCLC occurred regardless of EGFR-TKI treatment and EGFR mutational status, with a notable decrease in EGFR expression (P < 0.001) at both mRNA and protein levels. Pathway analysis revealed that gene overexpression was related to epigenetic alterations in t-SCLC. Interestingly, histone deacetylase inhibitors restored EGFR expression in SNU-2962A cells and their organoid model. The synergistic effects of third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor fimepinostat were validated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our study demonstrated that most t-SCLC cases showed neuronal subtypes with low EGFR expression. Differentially expressed gene analysis and t-SCLC preclinical models identified an epigenetic modifier as a promising treatment strategy for t-SCLC.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without targetable driver mutation have limited treatment options. In this study, we aimed to explore a new therapeutic strategy by using established nine patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and two-dimensional (2D) /3D culture models with specific genetic alternations. The gene mutations and copy number aberrations were detected by next-generation sequencing and confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by DNA sequencing, and genomic DNA quantitative PCR. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Drug sensitivities of PDX/2D/3D models were evaluated by in vivo and in vitro antitumor assays. RNA interference was performed to silence gene expression. Our study found that 44.4 % (4/9) of cases had CDKN2A homozygous deletion (homdel), while 33.3 % (3/9) had CDKN2B homdel. Additionally, 22.2 % (2/9) had amplification (amp) in wildtype CDK4, 44.4 % (4/9) in CDK6, and 44.4 % (4/9) in EGFR. Among the cases, 77.8 % (7/9) lacked CDKN2A, and 33.3 % (3/9) had high CDK4, CDK6, and EGFR had high protein expression. Moreover, 33.3 % (3/9) had KRAS mutations, and 66.7 % (6/9) had TP53 mutations. Antitumor activity of osimertinib plus palbociclib was assessed in four PDX/2D/3D models, two of which had simultaneous EGFR amp and CDKN2A/2B homdel. The data showed that NSCLC with EGFR amp and CDKN2A/2B homdel were sensitive to combined drugs. Additional oncogenic KRAS mutation reduced the drug's antitumor effect. EGFR amp is responsible for osimertinib sensitivity. Osimertinib plus palbociclib effectively treat NSCLC with wildtype EGFR and CDK6 amp and CDKN2A/2B homdel in the absence of oncogenic KRAS mutation.",

    "abstract": "Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), exemplified by osimertinib, have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our previous work has identified ASK120067 as a novel third-generation EGFR TKI with remarkable antitumor effects that has undergone New Drug Application (NDA) submission in China. Despite substantial progress, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs remains a significant challenge, impeding the long-term effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing high-throughput proteomics analysis on established TKI-resistant tumor models, and found a notable upregulation of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) expression in both osimertinib- and ASK120067-resistant tumors compared with the parental TKI-sensitive NSCLC tumors. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 impaired the growth of resistant cells and partially re-sensitized tumor cells to EGFR TKIs. Mechanistically, upregulated BCAT1 in resistant cells reprogrammed branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism and promoted alpha ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG)-dependent demethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27) and subsequent transcriptional derepression of glycolysis-related genes, thereby enhancing glycolysis and promoting tumor progression. Moreover, we identified WQQ-345 as a novel BCAT1 inhibitor exhibiting antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo against TKI-resistant lung cancer with high BCAT1 expression. In summary, our study highlighted the crucial role of BCAT1 in mediating resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs through epigenetic activation of glycolysis in NSCLC, thereby supporting BCAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TKI-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by high recurrence rates in the early stages. In a German cohort, recurrence-free survival after 5 years was 62% (stage IA1), 40.7% (stage IIA) and 28% (stage IIIA). In addition to the perioperative use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted tumor therapy is also making inroads as an innovation from the palliative setting into the early stages. Of particular relevance is the use of the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib, which has been shown to improve overall survival in the adjuvant setting. In this practice-oriented review, we briefly describe the current status of adjuvant targeted therapy and the associated testing and provide an outlook on further developments.

    "abstract": "Limited data are available comparing the efficacy of osi versus earlier generation TKIs for mNSCLC with atypical EGFR mutations (AMs) such as L861Q, G719X, S768I and exon20. We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of patients with EGFR-mutated mNSCLC treated from 2007 to 2023 with 1L TKIs, comparing outcomes for AM patients treated with osi, afatinib, and erlotinib. Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, treatment history, toxicity, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record and compared between TKIs using independent sample t-tests and chi-square analyses. Median progression free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) were compared via Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis and Cox multivariable regression. Among 355 patients with EGFR-mutated mNSCLC, 36 (10\u00a0%) harbored AMs in G719X (N=21; 6\u00a0%), Exon 20 (N=11; 3\u00a0%), L861Q (N=7; 2\u00a0%), S768I (N=4; 1\u00a0%), C797S (N=1; 0.3\u00a0%); 6 patients had compound mutations. Patients with classical mutations (CMs) vs AMs had similar baseline demographic and disease characteristics and usage of TKIs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.124). Among AM patients, osi yielded superior mPFS (22\u00a0m) vs afatinib (12\u00a0m; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) or erlotinib (9\u00a0m; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). mOS was likewise superior for osi (32\u00a0m) vs afatinib (21\u00a0m; p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) or erlotinib (17\u00a0m; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Dose-reduction rates due to AEs were lower for osi (19\u00a0%) vs afatinib (24\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) or erlotinib (23\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Discontinuation rates due to AEs were lower for osi vs afatinib (1\u00a0% vs 2\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) or erlotinib (2\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations are prevalent in about 50% of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Highly effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the EGFR protein have revolutionized treatment for the prevalent and aggressive lung malignancy. However, the emergence of new EGFR mutations and the rapid development of additional drug resistance mechanisms pose substantial challenge to the effective treatment of NSCLC. To investigate the underlying causes of drug resistance, we utilized next-generation sequencing data to analyse the genetic alterations in different tumor genomic states under the pressure of drug selection. This study involved a comprehensive analysis of whole exome sequencing data (WES) from NSCLC patients before and after treatment with afatinib and osimertinib with a goal to identify drug resistance mutations from the post-treatment WES data. We identified five EGFR single-point mutations (L718A, G724E, G724K, K745L, V851D) and one double mutation (T790M/L858R) associated with drug resistance. Through molecular docking, we observed that mutations, G724E, K745L, V851D, and T790M/L858R, have negatively affected the binding affinity with the FDA-approved drugs. Further, molecular dynamic simulations revealed the detrimental impact of these mutations on the binding efficacy. Finally, we conducted virtual screening against structurally similar compounds to afatinib and osimertinib and identified three compounds (CID 71496460, 73292362, and 73292545) that showed the potential to selectively inhibit EGFR despite the drug-resistance mutations. The WES-based study provides additional insight to understand the drug resistance mechanisms driven by tumor mutations and helps develop potential lead compounds to inhibit EGFR in the presence of drug resistance mutations.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown significant clinical benefits in patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations or the EGFR T790M mutation. The homologous recombination (HR) pathway is crucial for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Rad51 plays a central role in HR, facilitating the search for homology and promoting DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules. Rad51 is overexpressed in numerous types of cancer cells. B02, a specific small molecule inhibitor of Rad51, inhibits the DNA strand exchange activity of Rad51. Previous studies have indicated that B02 disrupted Rad51 foci formation in response to DNA damage and inhibited DSBs repair in human cells and sensitized them to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo. However, the potential therapeutic effects of combining osimertinib with a Rad51 inhibitor are not well understood. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the downregulation of Rad51 expression and activity can enhance the osimertinib-induced cytotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We used the MTS, trypan blue dye exclusion and colony-formation ability assay to determine whether osimertinib alone or in combination with B02 had cytotoxic effects on NSCLC cell lines. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to measure the amounts of Rad51 mRNA. The protein levels of phosphorylated AKT and Rad51 were determined by Western blot analysis. We found that osimertinib reduced Rad51 expression by inactivating AKT activity. Rad51 knockdown using small interfering RNA or AKT inactivation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or si-AKT RNA transfection enhanced the cytotoxic and growth inhibitory effects of osimertinib. In contrast, AKT-CA (a constitutively active form of AKT) vector-enforced expression could mitigate the cytotoxic and cell growth inhibitory effects of osimertinib. Furthermore, B02 significantly enhanced the cytotoxic and cell growth inhibitory effects of osimertinib in NSCLC cells. Compared to parental cells, the activation of AKT and Rad51 expression in osimertinib-resistant cells could not be significantly inhibited by osimertinib treatment. Moreover, the increased expression of Rad51 is associated with the resistance mechanism in osimertinib-resistant H1975 and A549 cells. Collectively, the downregulation of Rad51 expression and activity enhances the cytotoxic effect of osimertinib in human NSCLC cells.",

Additionally, the review introduces a therapeutic strategy involving the combination of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and chemotherapy drugs, highlighting the potential role of CHMs in overcoming NSCLC resistance. Through systematic analysis, we elucidate the primary resistance mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC treatment, emphasizing CHMs as potential treatment medicines and providing a fresh perspective for the development of next-generation EGFR-TKIs. This comprehensive review aims to guide the application of CHMs in combination therapy for NSCLC management, fostering the development of more effective and comprehensive treatment modalities to ultimately enhance patient outcomes.",

A population of lipid-associated macrophages, namely RNASE1_M, were linked to osimertinib resistance and LM development, which was regulated by Midkine (MDK) from malignant epithelial cells. MDK exhibited significant elevation in both CSF and plasma among patients with LMs, with higher MDK levels correlating to poorer outcomes in an independent cohort. Moreover, MDK could promote macrophage M2 polarization with lipid metabolism and phagocytic function. Furthermore, malignant epithelial cells in CSF, particularly after resistance to osimertinib, potentially achieved immune evasion through CD47-SIRPA interactions with RNASE1_M. In conclusion, we revealed a specific subtype of macrophages linked to osimertinib resistance and LM development, providing a potential target to overcome LMs.",

The search for this mutation is sometimes difficult, especially in cases of intracranial relapse, through this case report we attempt to discuss the possibility of initiating treatment with osimertinib despite an unknown T790M mutation in such situation. We present the case of a 70-year-old Moroccan male patient diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma initially metastatic to the pleura with an epithelial growth factor receptor mutation who received gefitinib in first line with a complete response, he subsequently presented with cerebral oligo-progression with extra cranial stability. The patient was started on osimertinib with unknown T790M status, as it was impossible to perform a cerebral biopsy, the evolution was characterized by a partial response followed by stereotactic radiotherapy then a complete response for 2 years. We can discuss osimertinib as an option for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with brain oligo-progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors and unknown T790M status, further studies are needed in this area.",

    "abstract": "The most recommended treatment for stage IV EGFR-positive lung cancer is osimertinib monotherapy. The dosage of osimertinib is fixed at 80 mg/day regardless of body surface area (BSA), however some patients withdraw or reduce the dosage due to adverse events (AEs). We performed a retrospective cohort study of 98 patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who received 80 mg osimertinib as the initial treatment. We investigated the impact of BSA on efficacy and safety of osimertinib. The cut-off value of BSA was estimated using the receiver operating characteristics curve, and was determined to be 1.5 m Differences in BSA affected the optimal dose of osimertinib. However, the PFS with osimertinib treatment was not affected by BSA. Therefore, when using osimertinib as an initial treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, dose reduction to control AEs should be considered, especially in the BSA<1.5 group.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a significant cause of treatment failure and cancer recurrence in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 30% of patients with EGFR-activating mutations exhibit primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. However, the potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that increased expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is associated with EGFR-TKIs resistance. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of PD-L1 in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. We found that PD-L1 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD, while the combination of EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy could improve its therapeutic efficacy. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that PD-L1 promoted the proliferation and autophagy and inhibited the apoptosis of LUAD cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that upregulation of PD-L1 was critical in inducing autophagy through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which was beneficial for tumor progression and the development of gefitinib resistance. Furthermore, we found that gefitinib combined with pemetrexed could synergistically enhance antitumor efficacy in PD-L1-overexpression LUAD cells. Overall, our study demonstrated that PD-L1 contributed to primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant LUAD cells, which may be mediated by inducing autophagy via the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings not only help improve the prognosis of patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD but also provide a reference for the research of other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), which serves the critical pillar for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the acquired resistance remains a challenge for its clinical application, for which, practical strategies to reverse gefitinib resistance in NSCLC are necessary. Ferroptosis, a programmed cell death driven by ferritin-dependent lipid peroxidation, involves in NSCLC progression and related chemoresistance. In our previous work, the self-synthesised EGFR inhibitor Yfq07 (N4, N6-disubstituted pyrimidine-4,6-diamine derivatives) displayed a considerable inhibitory effect on NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we observed that Yfq07 suppressed the proliferation of PC-9GR and HCC827GR cells, two gefitinib resistance NSCLC cell lines. Mechanically, Yfq07 inhibited the phosphorylation of the Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) highly expressed in multiple cancers, accompanied by downregulated miR-3648 and upregulated SOCS2. Inhibition or knockdown of DDR1 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, and on the other hand, also downregulated miR-3648 and promoted SOCS2 expression. More specifically, miR-3648 targeted the 3'UTR segment of SOCS2 mRNA and thus affecting the P-ERK signalling pathway to regulate the malignant behaviors of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Yfq07 also indirectly induced the ferroptosis of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells via SOCS2 triggered inhibition of xCT-GPX4 pathway. In conclusion, our study indicates that DDR1 inhibitor Yfq07 promotes ferroptosis and reverses gefitinib-resistance of NSCLC through DDR1-miR-3648-SOCS2 signalling pathway, which provides insights for targeted therapy of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC and drug developments targeting ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MET amplification as a mechanism of resistance to first-line osimertinib have few treatment options. Here, we report the primary analysis of the phase 2 INSIGHT 2 study evaluating tepotinib, a highly selective MET inhibitor, combined with osimertinib in this population. This open-label, phase 2 study was conducted at 179 academic centres and community clinics in 17 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC of any histology, with MET amplification by tissue biopsy fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH; MET gene copy number of \u22655 or MET-to-CEP7 ratio of \u22652) or liquid biopsy next-generation sequencing (MET plasma gene copy number of \u22652\u00b73), following progression on first-line osimertinib. Patients received oral tepotinib 500 mg plus oral osimertinib 80 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was independently assessed objective response in patients with MET amplification by central FISH treated with tepotinib plus osimertinib with at least 9 months of follow-up. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one study drug dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03940703 (enrolment complete). Between Feb 13, 2020, and Nov 4, 2022, 128 patients (74 [58%] female, 54 [42%] male) were enrolled and initiated tepotinib plus osimertinib. The primary activity analysis population included 98 patients with MET amplification confirmed by central FISH, previous first-line osimertinib and at least 9 months of follow-up (median 12\u00b77 months [IQR 9\u00b79-20\u00b73]). The confirmed objective response rate was 50\u00b70% (95% CI 39\u00b77-60\u00b73; 49 of 98 patients). The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events were peripheral oedema (six [5%] of 128 patients), decreased appetite (five [4%]), prolonged electrocardiogram QT interval (five [4%]), and pneumonitis (four [3%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 16 (13%) patients. Deaths of four (3%) patients were assessed as potentially related to either trial drug by the investigator due to pneumonitis (two [2%] patients), decreased platelet count (one [1%]), respiratory failure (one [1%]), and dyspnoea (one [1%]); one death was attributed to both pneumonitis and dyspnoea. Tepotinib plus osimertinib showed promising activity and acceptable safety in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and MET amplification as a mechanism of resistance to first-line osimertinib, suggesting a potential chemotherapy-sparing oral targeted therapy option that should be further investigated.

However, most patients develop resistance to targeted therapy, and subsequent systemic chemotherapy is recommended. The aim of this study was to characterize the subsequent line of therapy (LOT) following osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mNSCLC. Medical and pharmacy claims of adults who initiated a subsequent LOT (index) after initial osimertinib discontinuation between November 2015 and September 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria. After metastatic diagnosis, 22.2% and 49.6% of patients were treated with osimertinib in the first and second line, respectively. After osimertinib discontinuation, most patients were treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (57%), of which 40.3% included immuno-oncology therapy. Reuse or continuation of EGFR TKIs was also common (24%). Overall, the median time to treatment discontinuation for the index LOT was 2.4\u00a0months. Proportions of patients with\u2009\u2265\u20091 inpatient or emergency department visit were 31.9% and 35.6%, respectively. The duration of the LOT following osimertinib was short and associated with tolerability issues underscoring a high unmet need for new therapies to address EGFR TKI resistance.",

In cancer, EGFR amplifications and hotspot mutations such as L858R that promote proliferation have been detected in a significant fraction of non-small cell lung carcinomas and breast adenocarcinomas. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that glycosylation at asparagine residue 361 (N361) promotes dimerization and ligand binding. We stably expressed glycosylation-deficient mutant EGFR N361A, with or without the oncogenic mutation L858R. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry demonstrated that the mutants were each well expressed at the cell membrane. N361A decreased proliferation relative to wild-type EGFR as well as decreased sensitivity to ligands. Proximity ligation assays measuring co-localization of EGFR with its binding partner HER2 in cells revealed that N361A mutations increased co-localization. N361A, located near the binding interface for the EGFR inhibitor necitumumab, desensitized cells expressing the oncogenic EGFR L858R to antibody-based inhibition.

A total of 268 patients with NSCLC treated with osimertinib in our hospital from June 2019 to December 2023 were selected to observe the occurrence of cardiotoxicity and were divided into cardiotoxicity group and non-cardiotoxicity group. The differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, tumor stage, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, antiangiogenic drugs, and osimertinib treatment time were recorded and analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for cardiotoxicity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer caused by osimertinib treatment. Among the 268 patients with NSCLC treated with osimertinib, 58 patients developed cardiotoxicity, and the incidence of cardiotoxicity was 21.64%. There were statistically significant differences between the cardiotoxicity group and the non-cardiotoxicity group in terms of smoking history, hyperlipidemia history, combined chemotherapy, and combined radiotherapy (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that patients with a smoking history were at increased risk of cardiotoxicity compared with non-smoking patients (OR = 2.569, 95% CI = 1.398-6.523).

We then used this model sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib across coexisting cell populations within the same tumor. Pathway-centered signaling dynamics associated with response to treatment and morphological characteristics of the MCPs were assessed using Reverse Phase Protein Microarray. Signaling nodes differentially activated in MCPs less sensitive to treatment were then pharmacologically inhibited to identify target signaling proteins putatively implicated in promoting drug resistance. MCPs demonstrated highly heterogeneous sensitivities to osimertinib. Cell viability after treatment increased\u2009>\u200920% compared to the parental line in selected MCPs, whereas viability decreased by 75% in other MCPs. Reduced treatment response was detected in MCPs with higher proliferation rates, EGFR L858R expression, activation of EGFR binding partners and downstream signaling molecules, and expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Levels of activation of EGFR binding partners and MCPs' proliferation rates were also associated with response to c-MET and IGFR inhibitors. MCPs represent a suitable model system to characterize heterogeneous biomolecular behaviors in preclinical studies and identify and functionally test biological mechanisms associated with resistance to targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that combined therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) osimertinib and AXL inhibitor ONO-7475 is effective in preventing the survival of drug-tolerant cells in high-AXL-expressing EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Nevertheless, certain residual cells are anticipated to eventually develop acquired resistance to this combination therapy. In this study, we attempted to establish a multidrug combination therapy from the first-line setting to overcome resistance to this combination therapy in high-AXL-expressing EGFR-mutated NSCLC. siRNA screening assay showed that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) knockdown induced pronounced inhibition of cell viability in the presence of the osimertinib-ONO-7475 combination, which activates FGFR1 by upregulating FGF2 via the c-Myc pathway. Cell-based assays showed that triple therapy with osimertinib, ONO-7475, and the FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 significantly increased apoptosis by increasing expression of proapoptotic factor Bim and reduced cell viability compared with that observed for the osimertinib-ONO-7475 therapy. Xenograft models showed that triple therapy considerably suppressed tumor regrowth. A novel therapeutic strategy of additional initial FGFR1 inhibition may be highly effective in suppressing the emergence of osimertinib- and ONO-7475-resistant cells.",

    "abstract": "Constitutively active mutant EGFR is one of the major oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is a first-line option in patients that have metastatic or recurring disease. However, despite the high response rate to TKI, most patients have a partial response, and the disease eventually progresses in 10 to 19 months. It is believed that drug-tolerant cells that survive TKI exposure during the progression-free period facilitate the emergence of acquired resistance. Thus, targeting the drug-tolerant cells could improve the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR mutations. We demonstrated here that EGFR-mutant patient-derived xenograft tumors responded partially to osimertinib despite near-complete inhibition of EGFR activation. Signaling in AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways could be reactivated shortly after initial inhibition. As a result, many tumor cells escaped drug killing and regained growth following about 35 days of continuous osimertinib dosing. However, when an antibody to hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was given concurrently with osimertinib, tumors showed complete or near-complete responses. There was significant prolongation of progression-free survival of tumor-bearing mice as well. IHC and Western blot analysis of tumors collected in the early stages of treatment suggest that increased suppression of the AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways could be a mechanism that results in enhanced efficacy of osimertinib when it is combined with an anti-HDGF antibody. These results suggest that HDGF could be critically involved in promoting tolerance to TKI in patient-derived xenografts of NSCLC tumors. Blocking HDGF signaling could be a potential means to enhance EGFR-targeted therapy of NSCLC that warrants further advanced preclinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance to osimertinib limits its clinical efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. The widespread recognition of Taxus chinensis var. Mairei (Lem\u00e9e et L\u00e9vl) Cheng et L.K. Fu (Chinese yew) as a natural anti-cancer medication is well-established. However, the specific contribution of Taxus chinensis var. Mairei (Lem\u00e9e et L\u00e9vl) Cheng et L.K. Fu in addressing resistance to osimertinib is still uncertain. Based on the biological behaviors and lipid metabolism, we investigated whether aqueous extract of Taxus chinensis var. Mairei (Lem\u00e9e et L\u00e9vl) Cheng et L.K. Fu (AETC) could enhance the antitumor effect of osimertinib in NSCLC with an investigation on the precise mechanisms. The effect of AETC on enhancing osimertinib sensitivity was assessed via cell viability measurements, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, and lipid levels. Western blotting was used to verify the mechanisms of AETC responsible for overcoming the resistance to osimertinib via ERK1/2 overexpression and knockdown models. In vivo validation was conducted using subcutaneous xenografts from osimertinib-resistant cells in nude mice. Osimertinib-resistant cells exhibited altered cholesterol biosynthesis, which was induced by ERK1/2 activation. The combination of AETC and osimertinib can synergistically decrease the levels of ROS in cells, enhance apoptosis, and inhibit the growth of osimertinib-resistant cells. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that AETC can downregulate the key regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis by regulating ERK1/2, inhibiting the endogenous synthesis rate of cholesterol, and suppressing the level of lipids in osimertinib-resistant cells and xenograft tumors when combined with osimertinib, ultimately reversing resistance to osimertinib. The resistance to osimertinib is significantly influenced by cholesterol biosynthesis, highlighting its pivotal role in this context. AETC can enhance osimertinib sensitivity via ERK/SREBP-2/HMGCR-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis. These results provide a promising therapeutic target and potential treatment option for resistance to osimertinib.",

Circulating tumor DNA level changes reflect alterations in tumor burden and could be a dynamic indicator of treatment effect. This analysis aimed to determine whether longitudinal EGFR-mutation ctDNA testing could detect progressive disease (PD) before radiologic detection. This was a retrospective, exploratory ctDNA analysis in two phase 3 trials (FLAURA, NCT02296125; AURA3, NCT02151981). Patients had treatment-na\u00efve (FLAURA) or EGFR-TKI pre-treated (AURA3) advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations and on-study PD (RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors]), with a baseline ctDNA result and EGFR-mutation ctDNA monitoring beyond Cycle 3 Day 1. Patients received osimertinib versus comparator EGFR-TKIs (FLAURA) or chemotherapy (AURA3). Outcomes included time from ctDNA PD to RECIST PD and the first subsequent treatment (FLAURA only). Circulating tumor DNA PD preceded or co-occurred with RECIST-defined PD in 93 out of 146 patients (64%) in FLAURA and 82 out of 146 patients (56%) in AURA3. Median time from ctDNA PD to RECIST-defined PD (mo) was 3.4 and 2.6 in the osimertinib and comparator EGFR-TKI arms (FLAURA) and 2.8 and 1.5 in the osimertinib and chemotherapy arms (AURA3).

    "abstract": "Treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients possessing EGFR-activating mutations with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can confer an initial promising response. However, TKI resistance inevitably arises. Numerous TKI resistance mechanisms are identified including EGFR secondary mutations, bypass receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, and cellular transition e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To increase the knowledge of TKI resistance we performed an epigenetic screen to identify small non-coding (nc) genes with DNA methylation alterations in HCC827 NSCLC EGFR-mutated cells with acquired TKI resistance. We analyzed Infinium Methylation EPIC 850K Array data for DNA methylation changes present in both TKI-resistant HCC827\u00a0cells with EMT and MET-amplification. Hereby, we identified that the polymorphic maternal imprinted gene nc886 (vtRNA2-1) has a decrease in promoter DNA methylation in TKI-resistant cells. This epigenetic change was associated with an increase in the expression of nc886. The induction of EMT did not affect nc886 expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated distortion of the nc886 sequence increased the sensitivity of HCC827\u00a0cells towards TKI. Finally, nc886 sequence distortion hindered MET RTK activation and instead was EMT the endpoint TKI resistance mechanism. In conclusion, the expression of nc886 contributes to TKI resistance in the HCC827 NSCLC cell line by supporting cell survival and selection of the endpoint TKI resistance mechanism. We propose DNA methylation and expression changes for nc886 to constitute a novel TKI resistance contributing mechanism in NSCLC.",

This was a retrospective observational multicentric study aimed to describe the efficacy (objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) and toxicity of osimertinib 80 mg orally administered less frequently than daily (ranging from every other day to once-a-week) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Between January 2021 and August 2023, we enrolled 22 patients. Six received osimertinib 80 mg once-a-week, nine received 80 mg once-in-3-days and seven received 80 mg on alternate days. Responses included 0 complete responses, 7 (31.8%) partial responses, 9 (40.9%) stable disease and 5 (22.7%) progressive disease. ORR was 31.8%, and DCR was 72.7%.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of aumolertinib versus gefitinib among patients with baseline CNS metastases in the ANEAS study. Eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to orally receive either aumolertinib or gefitinib in a double-blinded fashion. Patients with asymptomatic, stable CNS metastases were included. Follow-up imaging of the same modality as the initial CNS imaging was performed every 6 weeks for 15 months, then every 12 weeks. CNS response was assessed by a neuroradiological blinded, independent central review (neuroradiological-BICR). The primary endpoint for this subgroup analysis was CNS progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 429 patients enrolled and randomized in the ANEAS study, 106 patients were found to have CNS metastases (CNS Full Analysis Set, cFAS) at baseline by neuroradiological-BICR, and 60 of them had CNS target lesions (CNS Evaluable for Response, cEFR). Treatment with aumolertinib significantly prolonged median CNS PFS compared with gefitinib in both cFAS (29.0 vs. 8.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.56; P < 0.001) and cEFR (29.0 vs. 8.3 months; HR = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.57; P < 0.001). The confirmed CNS overall response rate in cEFR was 85.7% and 75.0% in patients treated with aumolertinib and gefitinib, respectively. Competing risk analysis showed that the estimated probability of CNS progression without prior non-CNS progression or death was consistently lower with aumolertinib than with gefitinib in patients with and without CNS metastases at baseline. No new safety findings were observed. These results indicate a potential advantage of aumolertinib over gefitinib in terms of CNS PFS and the risk of CNS progression in patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC with baseline CNS metastases.

    "abstract": "Recent development in perioperative treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have changed the landscape of early lung cancer management. The ADAURA trial has demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant osimertinib treatment in resectable NSCLC patients; however, studies are required to show which subgroup of patients are at a high risk of relapse and require adjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. This study evaluated risk factors for postoperative relapse among patients who underwent complete resection. Data were obtained from the Korean Association for Lung Cancer Registry (KALC-R), a database created using a retrospective sampling survey by the Korean Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) and the Lung Cancer Registration Committee. A total of 3,176 patients who underwent curative resection was evaluated. The mean observation time was approximately 35.4 months. Among stage I to IIIA NSCLC patients, the EGFR-mutant subgroup included 867 patients, and 75.2%, 11.2%, and 11.8% were classified as stage I, stage II, and stage III, respectively. Within the EGFR-mutant subgroup, 44 (5.1%) and 121 (14.0%) patients showed early and late recurrence, respectively. Multivariate analysis on association with postoperative relapse among the EGFR-mutant subgroup showed that age, pathologic N and TNM stages, pleural invasion status, and surgery type were independent significant factors. Among the population that underwent complete resection for early NSCLC with EGFR mutation, patients with advanced stage, pleural invasion, or limited resection are more likely to show postoperative relapse.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant improvements that have been made in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival rates brought about by targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the emergence of drug resistance remains a limiting factor. However, a previous study has shown promising results by combining local microwave ablation (MWA) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. The current study presented the case of a Chinese female patient who was identified as having lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions (Del) in January 2014, and who experienced multiple instances of oligoprogression but showed a positive response to a combination of chemotherapy, MWA and a TKI drug. First, the patient was treated with four cycles of chemotherapy (120 mg docetaxel on day 1 and 40 mg cisplatin on days 1, 2 and 3; every three weeks as one cycle) and gefitinib (Iressa; 250 mg/day), maintaining a partial response for 17 months. In August 2015, a new solitary lesion was identified in the right lung and erlotinib (Tarceva; 150 mg/day) was administered for 3 months thereafter. In response, the patient underwent ablation of both the new right lung lesion and the primary left lung lesion in January 2016. Subsequently, a treatment course consisting of six cycles of chemotherapy (0.8 g pemetrexed on day 1 and 70 mg nedaplatin on days 1 and 2; every three weeks as one cycle) resulted in stable disease. In May 2016, the patient began treatment with osimertinib (AZD9291; 80 mg/day), resulting in a rapid shrinkage of the mediastinal lymph node after one month, which has been providing a benefit for the patient for 82 months and counting. Of note, the patient also developed metachronous colon cancer in January 2020, followed by the identification of right posterior liver metastases in February 2020 and lung metastases in May 2021 and in February 2022. To address this, the patient underwent radical resection of colon cancer and liver metastasectomy and received a combination of chemotherapy with bevacizumab, along with MWA for lung metastases. Remarkably, the patient has achieved long-term survival of 110 months. In conclusion, this case highlights the promising potential of combining MWA with systemic therapy for a patient with advanced LADC harboring EGFR exon 19 Del and metachronous lung and liver-metastasized colon adenocarcinoma.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are key drivers in a significant portion of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. While third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as osimertinib have demonstrated efficacy, the management of patients who continue to experience disease progression during treatment remains challenging. The emergence of drug resistance, including the development of secondary mutations, necessitates exploration of alternative treatment strategies. This study aims to evaluate and observe the efficacy and safety of almonertinib combined with anlotinib in patients after cancer progression during third-generation EGFR-TKI therapy. In this retrospective analysis, we included EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who were resistant to third-generation EGFR-TKIs. All patients were treated with almonertinib combined with anlotinib. The clinical characteristics, treatment history, clinical benefits, and adverse events of these patients were retrospectively collected. A total of 16 eligible patients were included in the analysis. The results revealed that combination therapy with almonertinib and anlotinib was effective in this patient cohort. The overall response rate was 25% and the disease control rate was 93.75%. The 6 and 12\u2009months of PFS rates were 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.3%, 100.0%) and 84.4% (95% CI 66.6%, 100.0%), respectively. Moreover, this combination therapy was generally well-tolerated, with manageable adverse events. Our retrospective analysis suggests that almonertinib and anlotinib combination therapy may represent a viable option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who have progressed on third-generation EGFR-TKIs, especially for those with posterior lines and no standard treatment options. Further investigation and larger clinical trials are warranted to validate these observations and refine treatment guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertions account for up to 10% of all EGFR mutations. Clinical outcomes in patients receiving approved EGFR exon 20 insertion-specific inhibitors have been variable. Although osimertinib has demonstrated antitumor activity in clinical trials, its clinical efficacy and translational potential remain to be determined in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion. In this multicenter phase II study, patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions for whom the standard chemotherapy failed received 80\u00a0mg osimertinib once daily. The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile. Among 15 patients enrolled at stage 1, the best response was most commonly disease stabilization (73.3\u00a0%), which did not meet the stage 1 threshold (objective response\u00a0\u2265\u00a02/15). As of data cutoff, two patients remained on the treatment. The median PFS and OS were 3.8 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.7-5.5) months and 6.5 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.9-not reached) months, respectively. Adverse events (\u2265grade 3) were anemia, hypercalcemia, and pneumonia (13.3\u00a0% each), and asthenia, femur fracture, increased alkaline phosphate, hyperkalemia, bone pain, and azotemia (6.7\u00a0% each). Pre-existing EGFR C797S mutation detected in plasma limited the efficacy of osimertinib. Osimertinib at 80\u00a0mg once daily had limited efficacy and mostly showed disease stabilization with an acceptable safety profile in advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertions. govIdentifier: NCT03414814.",

Following 6 weeks of treatment, the tumor assessment showed partial response (PR), making the patient eligible for surgery. The patient underwent single-port thoracoscopic left upper lobectomy + mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Intraoperatively, the left hilar lymph nodes were found to be tightly adherent to the apical-anterior branch of the left upper pulmonary artery. The main trunk of the left pulmonary artery was temporarily occluded with a vascular clamp to safely dissect the left upper pulmonary artery. The procedure was completed without conversion to open thoracotomy, achieving an R0 resection.

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often benefit from EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib. However, drug resistance remains a significant challenge in treatment. The unique properties of 1,2,3-triazole, a nitrogen-based compound, hold promise as potential solutions due to its versatile structural attributes and diverse biological effects, including anticancer properties. Our synthesis process involved the huisgen cycloaddition chemical method, which generated diverse icotinib derivatives. We evaluated the anticancer capabilities of these derivatives against various cancer cell lines, with a specific focus on NSCLC cells that exhibit drug resistance. Additionally, we investigated the binding affinity of selected compounds, including 3l, towards wild-type EGFR using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. Notably, icotinib derivatives such as derivative 3l demonstrated significant efficacy against different cancer cell lines, including those resistant to conventional therapies. Compound 3l exhibited potent activity with IC Icotinib derivative 3l, featuring a 1,2,3-triazole ring, demonstrates potent anticancer effects against drug-resistant NSCLC cells. Its enhanced binding affinity to EGFR and modulation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway position 3l as a promising candidate for the future development of anticancer drugs.",

However, higher tumor programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression is associated with a poor response to EGFR-TKIs, and information on the comparison between afatinib and osimertinib in PD-L1-positive EGFR-mutant NSCLC is scarce. We retrospectively analyzed data of patients with PD-L1-positive EGFR-mutant NSCLC to compare the effectiveness of afatinib and osimertinib. A total of 177 patients were included in the study. The Cox proportion hazard model was adjusted for age, sex, performance status, EGFR mutation status, PD-L1 expression level, and brain metastasis, revealing that there was no significant difference in risk for progression [hazard ratio (HR)=0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.64-1.53] or death (HR=0.96, 95% CI=0.54-1.73) between afatinib and osimertinib. In conclusion, the EGFR-TKI treatment duration and overall survival after the treatment with afatinib or osimertinib were similar in patients with PD-L1-positive EGFR-mutant NSCLC in the present study.",

At 17\u00a0months after the administration of gefitinib, left choroidal metastasis appeared. Stereotactic irradiation and ruthenium small-beam radiation were effective; however, the metastatic lesion showed regrowth 7\u00a0months after these treatments. Because the patient's choroidal oligometastasis was resistant to conservative therapy, left ophthalmectomy was performed. EGFR mutations (L858R and E709K) were detected in the resected choroidal tumor. The patient continued to take gefitinib. However, a neoplastic lesion developed on the optic nerve adjacent to the resected posterior eye segment. The lesion was treated with stereotactic radiation, gefitinib was switched to afatinib 30\u00a0mg, and the patient remains alive and disease free for 11\u00a0months.",

    "abstract": "For patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) locally advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) whose disease has progressed on or after osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC), no uniformly accepted standard of care exists. Moreover, limited efficacy of standard treatments indicates an unmet medical need, which is being addressed by ongoing clinical investigations, including the HERTHENA-Lung01 (NCT04619004) study of patritumab deruxtecan (HER3\u2011DXd). However, because limited information is available on real-world clinical outcomes in such patients, early-phase trials of investigational therapies lack sufficient context for comparison. This study describes the real-world clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes for patients with EGFRm mNSCLC who initiated a new line of therapy following previous osimertinib and PBC, including a subset matched to the HERTHENA-Lung01 population. This retrospective analysis used a US database derived from deidentified electronic health records. The reference cohort included patients with EGFRm mNSCLC who had initiated a new line of therapy between November 13, 2015 and June 30, 2021, following prior osimertinib and PBC. A subset of patients resembling the HERTHENA-Lung01 population was then extracted from the reference cohort; this matched subset was optimized using propensity score (PS) weighting. Endpoints were real-world overall survival (rwOS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS). Confirmed real-world objective response rate (rwORR; partial/complete response confirmed \u2265\u200928\u00a0days later) was calculated for the response-evaluable subgroups of patients (with \u2265\u20092 response assessments spaced \u2265\u200928\u00a0days apart). In the reference cohort (N\u2009=\u2009273), multiple treatment regimens were used, and none was predominant. Median rwPFS and rwOS were 3.3 and 8.6\u00a0months, respectively; confirmed rwORR (response evaluable, n\u2009=\u2009123) was 13.0%. In the matched subset (n\u2009=\u2009126), after PS weighting, median rwPFS and rwOS were 4.2 and 9.1\u00a0months, respectively; confirmed rwORR (response evaluable, n\u2009=\u200957) was 14.1%. The treatment landscape for this heavily pretreated population of patients with EGFRm mNSCLC is fragmented, with no uniformly accepted standard of care. A high unmet need exists for therapeutic options that provide meaningful improvements in clinical benefit.",

    "title": "METTL14-Mediated Bim mRNA m6A Modification Augments Osimertinib Sensitivity in EGFR-Mutant NSCLC Cells.",
    "abstract": "Resistance to osimertinib represents a significant challenge for the successful treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating mutations in EGFR. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNAs is critical for various biological processes, yet whether m6A regulates osimertinib resistance of NSCLC remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that developing osimertinib-resistant phenotypes depends on m6A reduction resulting from downexpression of m6A methyltransferase METTL14 in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that specific knockdown of METTL14 was sufficient to confer osimertinib resistance and that elevated expression of METTL14 rescued the efficacy of osimertinib in the resistant NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, METTL14 promoted m6A methylation of pro-apoptotic Bim mRNA and increased Bim mRNA stability and expression, resulting in activating the Bim-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling and thereby promoting osimertinib-induced cell apoptosis. Analysis of clinical samples revealed that decreased expression of METTL14 was observed in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC tissues and significantly associated with a poor prognosis. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism by which METTL14-mediated m6A methylation of Bim mRNA inhibited osimertinib resistance of NSCLC cells. It offers more evidences for the involvement of m6A modification in regulation of osimertinib resistance and provides potential therapeutic targets for novel approaches to overcome the tolerance of osimertinib and other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Implications: This study offers more evidences for the involvement of METTL14-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification in regulation of osimertinib resistance and provides potential therapeutic targets for novel approaches to overcome the tolerance of osimertinib and other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has emerged as a significant obstacle in managing patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is a kind of Chinese patent medicine known for its heat-clearing and detoxifying properties. Studies have shown a correlation between tumor drug resistance and enrichment of cancer stem cells (CSCs). We aim to investigate the feasibility of TRQ enhancing sensitivity to gefitinib by targeting CSCs and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In our study, TRQ significantly inhibited cell proliferation in gefitinib-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models including 2D cell lines, 3D cell spheres, tumor-bearing animal and organoids. Compared with the gefitinib group alone, addition of TRQ elevated ROS levels, attenuated upregulation of the protein levels of sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) induced by gefitinib treatment, and inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Scavenging ROS could restore tumor stemness, attenuate the inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of STAT3, and promote cell proliferation. These results suggested that TRQ could enhance sensitivity of NSCLC models to gefitinib, providing a new combined treatment strategy.",

Patients with TP53 co-mutations, detectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), baseline liver metastases, and those without ctDNA clearance on treatment have poor prognoses. We evaluated outcomes in these high-risk subgroups. This analysis included patients with treatment-naive, EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC randomized to amivantamab-lazertinib (n\u00a0= 429) or osimertinib (n\u00a0= 429) in MARIPOSA. Pathogenic alterations were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of baseline blood ctDNA with Guardant360 CDx. Ex19del and L858R ctDNA in blood was analyzed at baseline and cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1) with Biodesix droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Baseline ctDNA for NGS of pathogenic alterations was available for 636 patients (amivantamab-lazertinib, n\u00a0=\u00a0320; osimertinib, n\u00a0= 316). Amivantamab-lazertinib improved median PFS (mPFS) versus osimertinib for patients with TP53 co-mutations {18.2 versus 12.9 months; HR 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.87]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003} and for patients with wild-type TP53 [22.1 versus 19.9 months; HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.52-1.07)]. In patients with EGFR-mutant, ddPCR-detectable baseline ctDNA, amivantamab-lazertinib significantly prolonged mPFS versus osimertinib [20.3 versus 14.8 months; HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.53-0.86); P\u00a0= 0.002].

    "abstract": "Osimertinib induces a marked response in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. However, acquired resistance to osimertinib remains an inevitable problem. In this study, we aimed to investigate osimertinib-resistant mechanisms and evaluate the combination therapy of afatinib and chemotherapy. We established osimertinib-resistant cell lines (PC-9-OR and H1975-OR) from EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-9 and H1975 by high exposure and stepwise method. Combination therapy of afatinib plus carboplatin (CBDCA) and pemetrexed (PEM) was effective in both parental and osimertinib-resistant cells. We found that expression of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was upregulated in resistant cells using cDNA microarray analysis. We demonstrated that TSP-1 increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases through integrin signaling and promotes tumor invasion in both PC-9-OR and H1975-OR, and that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was involved in H1975-OR. Afatinib plus CBDCA and PEM reversed TSP-1-induced invasion ability and EMT changes in resistant cells. In PC-9-OR xenograft mouse models (five female Balb/c-Nude mice in each group), combination therapy strongly inhibited tumor growth compared with afatinib monotherapy (5\u2009mg/kg, orally, five times per week) or CBDCA (75\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally, one time per week)\u2009+\u2009PEM (100\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally, one time per week) over a 28-day period. These results suggest that the combination of afatinib plus CBDCA and PEM, which effectively suppresses TSP-1 expression, may be a promising option in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients after the acquisition of osimertinib resistance.",

    "abstract": "Lazertinib is a recently developed third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for patients with advanced EGFR T790M-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. We evaluated the effectiveness of lazertinib compared with osimertinib using an external control. We obtained individual patient data for the lazertinib arm from the LASER201 trial and the osimertinib arm from registry data at the Samsung Medical Center. In total, 75 and 110 patients were included in the lazertinib and osimertinib groups, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group had 60 patients and all baseline characteristics were balanced. The median follow-up duration was 22.0 and 29.6\u00a0months in the lazertinib and osimertinib group, respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) were 76.7% and 86.7% for lazertinib and osimertinib, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.08). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.3\u00a0months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.5-19.1) and 14.4\u00a0months (95% CI 11.8-18.1) for the lazertinib and osimertinib group, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97; 95% CI 0.64-1.45, p\u2009=\u20090.86). The median overall survival with lazertinib was not reached and that with osimertinib was 29.8\u00a0months (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25-0.77, p\u2009=\u20090.005). Our study suggests that lazertinib has an ORR and PFS comparable to those of osimertinib and has the potential for superior survival benefits.",

    "abstract": "There is a paucity of comprehensive knowledge pertaining to the underlying mechanisms leading to gefitinib resistance in individuals diagnosed NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations who inevitably develop resistance to gefitinib treatment within six months to one year. In our preceding investigations, we have noted a marked upregulation of IGFBP2 in the neoplastic tissues of NSCLC, predominantly in the periphery of the tissue, implying its plausible significance in NSCLC. Consequently, in the current research, we delved into the matter and ascertained the molecular mechanisms that underlie the participation of IGFBP2 in the emergence of gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells. Firstly, the expression of IGFBP2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung cancer tissues of 20 NSCLC patients with gefitinib tolerance was found to be significantly higher than that of non-tolerant patients. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that IGFBP2 plays a significant role in the acquisition of gefitinib resistance. Mechanistically, IGFBP2 can activate STAT3 to enhance the transcriptional activity of CXCL1, thereby increasing the intracellular expression level of CXCL1, which contributes to the survival of lung cancer cells in the gefitinib environment. Additionally, we identified ITGA5 as a key player in IGFBP2-mediated gefitinib resistance, but it does not function as a membrane receptor in the process of linking IGFBP2 to intracellular signaling transduction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the promoting role and mechanism of IGFBP2 in acquired gefitinib resistance caused by non-EGFR secondary mutations, suggesting the potential of IGFBP2 as a biomarker for gefitinib resistance and a potential intervention target.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, EGFR-TKI-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), a well-known adverse effect, can seriously affect the treatment outcome. There is currently no international consensus on the efficacy and safety of re-administration of EGFR-TKI after EGFR-TKI-induced ILD. We report a case of a 62-year-old male with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR L858R mutation who was treated with osimertinib at a dose of 80\u00a0mg/day as first-line therapy. On the sixth day of treatment, the patient developed grade 4 ILD, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and paroxysmal dry cough. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated the presence of type I respiratory failure, while the chest CT scan revealed newly developed ground-glass opacities in both lungs and a considerable amount of pleural effusion on the left side. Subsequently, the patient was administered methylprednisolone for anti-inflammatory therapy, in conjunction with oxygen therapy, anti-infection treatment, and closed thoracic drainage, which resulted in a favourable recovery and discharge after 18 days. During this period, the patient adhered to third-generation EGFR-TKI oral targeted therapy. Nevertheless, within a week of discharge, the patient was readmitted due to the recurrence of chest tightness and shortness of breath. A chest CT scan indicated a recurrent ILD. Despite the administration of high-dose methylprednisolone for 9\u00a0days, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in death. It is of the utmost importance to conduct a meticulous evaluation of the severity of osimertinib-induced ILD in order to ascertain the potential risks and benefits of EGFR-TKI rechallenge. Particularly, for patients with grade 4 ILD, firm drug discontinuation should be considered.",

However, many patients are hesitant to commence chemotherapy upfront. We describe outcomes to Pem-Plat-Osi after first-line osimertinib failure. Patients with advanced EGFR-mutated (ex19del/L858R) NSCLC who had Pem-Plat-Osi between 1/7/2018-30/9/2023 after progression on first-line osimertinib at National Cancer Centre Singapore, Prince of Wales Hospital and Chinese University of Hong Kong were identified. Key endpoints were time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS). A total of 60 patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 62, 53.3\u00a0% (32/60) were male and 76.7\u00a0% (46/60) were never smokers. Ex19del comprised 56.7\u00a0% (34/60) and L858R 43.3\u00a0% (26/60). Baseline central nervous system (CNS) metastases were present in 66.7\u00a0% (40/60). Median TTF on osimertinib (TTF1) was 14.4\u00a0months(m) and median time to initiation of Pem-Plat-Osi was 41\u00a0days(d) (range 0-652) after progression on osimertinib. Partial response (PR) or stable disease to Pem-Plat-Osi was achieved in 81.7\u00a0%(49/60). Intracranial disease control was achieved in 90.6\u00a0% (29/32) of patients with measurable CNS metastases, including those who did not undergo brain radiotherapy. At median follow up of 31.2\u00a0m, median TTF on Pem-Plat-Osi (TTF2) was 6.6\u00a0m. Median TTF1\u00a0+\u00a0TTF2 was 23.4\u00a0m and median OS was 34.2\u00a0m. Survival outcomes were similar comparing ex19del and L858R (median TTF1\u00a0+\u00a0TTF2 21.8\u00a0m vs 23.5\u00a0m, p\u00a0=\u00a00.90; median OS 34.2\u00a0m vs 36.8\u00a0m, p\u00a0=\u00a00.37) and in patients without/with baseline CNS metastases (median TTF1\u00a0+\u00a0TTF2 21.8\u00a0m vs 23.4\u00a0m, p\u00a0=\u00a00.44; median OS 36.2\u00a0m vs 31.9\u00a0m, p\u00a0=\u00a00.65). TTF1 duration was not significantly associated with TTF2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.76). Patients who started Pem-Plat-Osi within 20d of progression on osimertinib had significantly longer TTF2 as compared to patients who started after 20d (median 8.4\u00a0m versus 6.0\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), which remained statistically significant on multivariable analysis. Our real-world data supports the efficacy of Pem-Plat-Osi after progression on first-line osimertinib, including L858R and baseline CNS metastases. Chemotherapy initiation within 20d of Osi progression was predictive of superior TTF2.",

    "abstract": "The USFDA granted regular approval to Osimertinib (AZD9291) on March 2017, for treating individuals with metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer having EGFR T790M mutation. Clinically, Osimertinib stands at the forefront for the treatment of patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Osimertinib forms a covalent bond with the Cys797 residue and predominantly spares binding to WT-EGFR, thereby reducing toxicity and enabling the administration of doses that effectively inhibit T790M. However, a high percentage of patients treated with Osimertinib (AZD9291) developed a tertiary cysteine797 to serine797 (C797S) mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, rendering resistance to it. This comprehensive review sheds light on the chemistry, computational aspects, structural features, and expansive spectrum of biological activities of Osimertinib and its analogues. The in-depth exploration of these facets serves as a valuable resource for medicinal chemists, empowering them to design better Osimertinib analogues. This exhaustive study not only provides insights into improving potency but also emphasizes considerations for mutant selectivity and optimizing pharmacokinetic properties. This review acts as a guiding beacon for the strategic design and development of next-generation Osimertinib analogues.",

    "abstract": "The ADAURA trial confirmed adjuvant Osimertinib's efficacy in EGFR-mutated Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the limited mature overall survival (OS) data at approval poses a challenge. This study explores patient preferences in the absence of complete OS information, hypothesizing that disease-free survival (DFS) benefit alone may influence adjuvant Osimertinib pursuit. At Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (Jan-Dec 2021), patients assessed for adjuvant therapy received a survey probing OS and DFS preferences. Scenarios were (a) minimum OS justifying Osimertinib, (b) minimum DFS improvement justifying 3-years of adjuvant Osimertinib, (c) minimum 5-year DFS percent change, and (d) minimum OS justifying copay changes. Results were analyzed. Of 524 NSCLC patients, 51 participated. Scenario 1 saw 56% requiring a 12-month OS benefit for Osimertinib justification. In scenario 2, 72% deemed a 12-month DFS benefit sufficient. Scenario 3 revealed 31% opting out despite a 10% OS increase. Scenario 4 showed varied willingness to pay, with 33% unwilling to any shoulder copayment even with a 10-year OS benefit. This study explores patient preferences without complete OS data, revealing diverse thresholds. Factors include employment, education, and willingness to pay. Findings underscore shared decision-making importance. Limitations include sample size, potential biases, and regional focus; larger cohorts are needed for validation.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib represents the standard of care for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring classical epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, constituting 80%-90% of all EGFR alterations. In the remaining cases, an assorted group of uncommon alterations of EGFR (uEGFR) can be detected, which confer variable sensitivity to previous generations of EGFR inhibitors, overall with lower therapeutic activity. Data on osimertinib in this setting are limited and strongly warranted. The ARTICUNO study retrospectively evaluated data on osimertinib activity from patients with advanced NSCLC harboring uEGFR treated in 21 clinical centers between August 2017 and March 2023. Data analysis was carried out with a descriptive aim. Investigators collected response data according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. The median duration of response, progression-free survival (mPFS), and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Eighty-six patients harboring uEGFR and treated with osimertinib were identified. Patients with 'major' uEGFR, that is, G719X, L861X, and S768I mutations (n\u00a0= 51), had an overall response rate (ORR) and mPFS of 50% and 9 months, respectively. Variable outcomes were registered in cases with rarer 'minor' mutations (n\u00a0= 27), with ORR and mPFS of 31% and 4 months, respectively. Among seven patients with exon 20 insertions, ORR was 14%, while the best outcome was registered among patients with compound mutations including at least one classical EGFR mutation (n\u00a0= 13). Thirty patients presented brain metastases (BMs) and intracranial ORR and mPFS were 58% and 9 months, respectively. Amplification of EGFR or MET, TP53 mutations, and EGFR E709K emerged after osimertinib failure in a dataset of 18 patients with available rebiopsy. The ARTICUNO study confirms the activity of osimertinib in patients with uEGFR, especially in those with compound uncommon-common mutations, or major uEGFR, even in the presence of BMs. Alterations at the E709 residue of EGFR are associated with resistance to osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse reactions of metronomic oral vinorelbine and its combination therapy as second- and later-line regimens for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC patients undergoing metronomic oral vinorelbine as second- and later-line regimens in Fujian Cancer Hospital from October 2018 to October 2022 were enrolled, and patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. The efficacy and safety of metronomic oral vinorelbine monotherapy and its combination therapy regimens were compared. Of 57 study subjects, 63.2% received third- and later-line therapy, with median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 4\u00a0months, overall response rate (ORR) of 10.5%, and disease control rate (DCR) of 80.7%. The incidence of therapy-related adverse events was 42.1%, and there was only one case presenting grades 3 and 4 adverse events (1.8%). Among driver gene-negative participants, vinorelbine combination therapy regimens achieved longer mPFS (4.6 vs. 1.2\u00a0months, hazards ratio\u2009=\u20090.11, P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and comparable toxicity in relative to metronomic oral vinorelbine, and metronomic oral vinorelbine combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors showed the highest response, with mPFS of 5.6\u00a0months (95% CI 4.8 to 6.4\u00a0months), ORR of 25%, and DCR of 81.3%. Among participants with gradual resistance to osimertinib, continuing osimertinib in combination with metronomic oral vinorelbine achieved mPFS of 6.3\u00a0months (95% CI 0.1 to 12.5\u00a0months) and DCR of 86.7%. Metronomic oral vinorelbine and its combination therapy regimens are favorable options as second- and later-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients, with acceptable efficacy and tolerable toxicity. Vinorelbine combination therapy regimens show higher efficacy and comparable toxicity in relative to metronomic oral vinorelbine, and metronomic oral vinorelbine may have a synergistic effect with immunotherapy and EGFR-TKI targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk is higher among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and specific subgroups, including the elderly, but little is known about the VTE risk of different generations of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and whether the risk differs by demographic characteristics. This study aims to compare the risk of VTE (deep venous thromboembolism [DVT]; pulmonary embolism [PE]) between a third-generation EGFR-TKI and first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and stratify VTE risk by sex, age, and race/ethnicity in third-generation EGFR-TKI users. Via the 2006-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, this retrospective cohort study included older patients (aged \u226565 years) with advanced NSCLC who initiated on a third-generation EGFR-TKI (n\u00a0=\u00a0493) and first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs (n\u00a0=\u00a01036). We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) with the Cox proportional hazards model. A third-generation EGFR-TKI had a significantly higher VTE risk than first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.01-1.57]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.037), with an elevated risk in males (HR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.47-3.19]; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), patients aged \u226575 years (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.026), and non-Hispanic Whites (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.10-1.95]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.010). Males consistently showed a significantly higher risk of DVT (HR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.29-4.80]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and PE (HR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.29-3.11]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.002).

    "abstract": "Based on the FLAURA and AURA III trials, compared to first- and second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), osimertinib provides a longer overall survival benefit for patients with untreated EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Similar to other EGFR-TKIs, drug resistance is, however, inevitable. The most common mechanism of acquired resistance to first-line osimertinib therapy is the C797S mutation, which accounts for 6% of cases. In view of the current challenges of the development of the next generation of EGFR inhibitors, the mechanism of third-generation targeted drug resistances and targeted strategies are key for further exploration. Our case report discusses a female patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma carrying the EGFR exon19 E746_A750delinsIP mutation who received osimertinib as first-line therapy and acquired C797S resistance during treatment. The patient was then treated with icotinib for 8\u2005months until the disease progressed. Icotinib may be effective in patients with the EGFR 19del-C797S resistant mutation acquired after osimertinib treatment.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastases (LMs) exhibit a high incidence in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) post-treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This investigation evaluates the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 80 mg once daily osimertinib in patients with LMs resistant to prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs. In this phase II multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, 80 mg osimertinib was administered to patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had developed LMs subsequent to treatment with prior EGFR TKIs. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), assessed alongside objective response rate by the blinded independent central review (BICR) and a pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the first day of cycles 3 and 6. A total of 73 patients diagnosed with LM were treated with osimertinib, including 64 patients evaluable for the LM efficacy set-T790M negative (n = 62) and T790M positive (n = 2). The median OS in the full-analysis set was 15.6 months (95% CI, 11.5 to 20.2). The objective response rate for LM was 51.6%, including a 15.6% complete response, and the disease control rate was 81.3% by BICR in the LM efficacy evaluable set. The median LM progression-free survival by BICR was 11.2 months (95% CI, 7.7 to 15.3), the duration of response was 12.6 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 17.7), and OS was 15.0 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 18.7). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the CSF to free plasma osimertinib ratio was 22%. Most safety profiles were grade 1 and 2. The study demonstrates significant intracranial efficacy and survival benefits of 80 mg once daily osimertinib in NSCLC patients with LMs. The data support considering daily 80 mg of osimertinib as a treatment option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with LMs, irrespective of T790M mutation status.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline vitamin D level on the outcome in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR)-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received either gefitinib or gefitinib with chemotherapy (pemetrexed and carboplatin) as first-line therapy in a prospective randomized study. This was a post hoc analysis of a phase III randomized trial comparing gefitinib with gefitinib with carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations in the first-line setting. As a part of regular practice, baseline vitamin D levels were measured using circulating 25(OH) levels in blood. We included 334 patients who had baseline vitamin D levels in the study and evaluated the effect of the vitamin D level on oncologic outcomes. There were 136 (40.7%) patients with a sufficient (>20\u2009ng/mL) baseline vitamin D level, and 198 (59.3%) patients who were deficient in vitamin D (<20\u2009ng/mL). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with normal vitamin D levels was 17\u2009months, whereas that in patients with deficient vitamin D levels was 15\u2009months, with a hazard ratio of 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.03-2.06).

On multivariate analysis, only 2 factors impacted the PFS, the baseline vitamin D level, and the treatment regimen; other factors like age, sex, disease stage, and performance status did not. Baseline vitamin D levels have a significant impact on PFS, whereas OS is not affected by the baseline vitamin D levels on patients receiving targeted therapy for EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

High Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression \u2265 50% demonstrated to be a negative prognostic factor, mostly among Asian populations treated with 1st/2nd generation TKI. We investigated the impact of PD-L1 expression on the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) within a cohort of patients receiving osimertinib as first-line treatment. Our bi-centre French retrospective study included all newly diagnosed patients with an advanced EGFRm (common and uncommon) NSCLC, between May 2018 and November 2022, treated with osimertinib. The primary endpoint was OS according to tumor proportion score PD-L1 expression (low/intermediate < 50% vs high \u2265 50%). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model for adjusted multivariate analysis. Of 96 patients, median age was 71 (IQR 62-76), 70 were women (72.9%), 81 had a performance status (PS) 0-1 (84.3%). Median follow-up was 22.6 months (95% CI 20.5-24.7). Twenty patients (20.8%) had high PD-L1 expression \u2265 50%. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed based on PD-L1 status. Patients with PD-L1 \u2265 50% had significant shorter PFS and OS than those with PD-L1 < 50%, respectively 9.3 vs 17.5 months (p = 0.044 months) and 14.3 vs 26.0 months (p = 0.025).

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain the frontline standard of care for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. An updated toxicity profile of EGFR-TKIs proves valuable in guiding clinical decision making. This study comprehensively assessed the risk of EGFR-TKI-related adverse events (AEs) involving different systems/organs. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library for phase III randomized controlled trials comparing EGFR-TKI monotherapy with placebo or chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The odds ratio (OR) of all-grade and high-grade adverse events (AEs) including dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, and respiratory events was pooled for a meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses based on the control arm (placebo or chemotherapy) and individual EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib) were conducted. Thirty-four randomized controlled trials comprising 15,887 patients were included. The pooled OR showed EGFR-TKIs were associated with a significantly increased risk of all-grade dermatologic AEs including paronychia, pruritus, rash, skin exfoliation, and skin fissures, gastrointestinal AEs including abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, mouth ulceration, and stomatitis, hepatic AEs including elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and respiratory AEs including epistaxis, interstitial lung disease and rhinorrhea. Furthermore, a significantly increased risk of high-grade rash (OR 7.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.11, 12.00), diarrhea (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.44, 3.05), elevated alanine aminotransferase (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.71, 9.03), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.05, 9.92) and interstitial lung disease (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.38, 4.01) was observed in patients receiving EGFR-TKIs. When stratified by individual EGFR-TKIs, gefitinib showed a significant association with all-grade and high-grade hepatotoxicity and interstitial lung disease. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors were associated with a significantly increased risk of various types of AEs. Clinicians should be vigilant about the risks of these EGFR-TKI-related AEs, particularly for severe hepatotoxicity and interstitial lung disease, to facilitate early detection and proper management.",

However, it is uncertain whether currently available EGFR-TKIs are effective against rare EGFR mutations and compound mutations. Herein, the effectiveness of almonertinib and alflutinib, the third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors developed in China, on rare EGFR S768I mutations and compound mutations is identified. In this study, using CRISPR method, four EGFR S768I mutation cell lines were constructed, and the sensitivity of EGFR to almonertinib and alflutinib was tested, with positive controls being the 1st (gefitinib), 2nd (afatinib), and 3rd (osimertinib) generation drugs. The present results indicate that almonertinib and alflutinib can effectively inhibit cell viability and proliferation in rare EGFR S768I mutations through the ERK or AKT pathways in a time-dependent manner, by blocking the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis. These findings suggest that almonertinib and alflutinib may be potential therapeutic options for non-small cell lung cancer patients with the EGFR S768I mutation.",

    "abstract": "The safety and feasibility of repeat biopsy after systemic treatment for non-small cell lung cancer have received extensive attention in recent years. The purpose of this research was to compare complication rates between initial biopsy and rebiopsy in non-small cell lung cancer patients with progressive disease and to assess complication risk factors and clinical results after rebiopsy. The study included 113 patients initially diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent lung biopsy at initial biopsy and rebiopsy after progression while on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and/or chemotherapy from January 2018 to December 2021. We compared the incidence of complications between the initial biopsy and rebiopsy and analyzed the predictors factors that influenced complications in patients who underwent rebiopsy. The successful rate of rebiopsy was 88.5% (100/113). With the exception of two cases where lung adenocarcinoma changed into small cell lung cancer with gefitinib treatment, 98 individuals retained their initial pathological type. The secondary EGFR T790M mutation accounts for 55.6% of acquired resistance. The total number of patients with complications in initial biopsy was 25 (22.1%) and 37 (32.7%) in the rebiopsy. The incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage increased from 7.1% at the initial biopsy to 10.6% at rebiopsy, while the incidence of pneumothorax increased from 14.2% to 20.4%. Compared with the initial biopsy, the incidence of overall complications, parenchymal hemorrhage, and pneumothorax increased by 10.6%, 3.5%, and 6.2%, respectively. In all four evaluations (pneumorrhagia, pneumothorax, pleural reaction, and overall complication), there were no significant differences between the rebiopsy and initial biopsy (all  Compared with the initial biopsy, the complication rates displayed a slight, but not significant, elevation in rebiopsy.

    "abstract": "Mutated BRAF is identified in 1%-5% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, with non-V600 mutations accounting for 50%-70% of these. The most common non-V600 mutation is BRAF G469V/A. Currently, there are no targeted therapies available for non-V600 mutated patients. A recent report provided interesting preclinical evidence revealing sensitivity of BRAF G469V to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, raising the possibility of repurposing anti-EGFR agents. It is therefore worthy to characterize the clinical and molecular features of BRAF G469V/A-mutant NSCLC to provide more insights for precision therapy. We conducted a retrospective screening of 25,694 Chinese patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC to identify individuals with mutated BRAF. Additionally, we performed similar screenings on patients with adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n\u2009=\u2009567) and the MSKCC cohort (n\u2009=\u20091152). Subsequently, we characterized the clinical and molecular features of the patients carrying BRAF mutations. BRAF G469V was identified in 28 (0.1%) patients from the Chinese NSCLC cohort and 5 (0.9%) from TCGA-LUAD. Notably, none was identified in the MSKCC cohort. G469A was found in 79 (0.3%) Chinese patients, 2 (0.4%) from TCGA-LUAD, and 9 (0.8%) from the MSKCC cohort. Relative allele frequency analysis suggested most BRAF mutations as driven clones. Tumor mutation burden (median 4 mutations/Mb) was not significantly different between patients carrying G469V, G469A, V600E, or other BRAF mutations. Surprisingly, KRAS mutations were found in approximately 50% of patients with G469V mutation and about 8% of patients with G469A mutation, representing a prominent potential resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors. Structural modeling suggested BRAF G469V and G469A as binding partners of gefitinib. Our large-scale analysis characterized the prevalence and mutational landscape of BRAF G469V/A-mutant NSCLC and proposed gefitinib as a potential option, providing a basis for further investigations on treating BRAF-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), addressing optimal treatment for uncommon EGFR mutations like G719X in exon 18, S768I in exon 20, and L861Q in exon 21 remains a pivotal yet challenging frontier. Contrary to the well-established efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in common EGFR mutations, these uncommon alterations pose unmet medical needs due to a lack of comprehensive evidence. While afatinib, a second-generation EGFR-TKI, has received FDA approval for patients with these uncommon EGFR mutations, the approval was based on a post-hoc analysis of randomized clinical trials. Recent developments include multiple clinical trials investigating the efficacy of both second- and third-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. A noteworthy example is a prospective phase II trial of osimertinib including the landmark UNICORN study, which has shown promising results in treating uncommon EGFR mutations. Despite various reports on the efficacy of afatinib and osimertinib in treating uncommon EGFR mutations, the appropriate use of these TKIs remains unclear. This review aims to consolidate the findings from the latest clinical trials focused on uncommon EGFR mutations, outlining variations in the therapeutic efficacy of these TKIs based on the specific genetic mutation. By synthesizing these findings, we aim to guide oncologists toward more informed decisions in employing TKIs for NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations other than exon 20 insertion. Additionally, we explore potential treatment strategies tailored to these patient populations to address the challenges posed by these mutations.",

Evidence has showed the major treatment failure is local relapses and limited metastases. Several studies have demonstrated the value of radiotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the EGFR T790M mutation after the development of TKI resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the role of radiation in T790M-mutant NSCLC and the value of early radiotherapy for NSCLC with T790M-mediated EGFR-TKI resistance. Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines were established via stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of gefitinib (PC-9-GR). Droplet digital PCR was used to determine the relative T790M subclone abundance.  PC-9-GR cells exhibited higher radiosensitivity than PC-9\u00a0cells (sensitivity enhancement ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.5). Salvage radiation reduced the number of T790M-mutant subclones, and the relative T790M abundance was significantly lower than that without radiation at 90 days (10.94% vs. 21.54%). Prophylactic radiation prevented the development of T790M subclones. These results were also confirmed  Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC with the T790M mutation had higher radiosensitivity than that without the mutation, possibly mediated by SPOCK1. Early radiotherapy can eliminate T790M subclones, providing evidence for the benefit of early local treatment in patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer patients with mutated EGFR. However, the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in wild-type EGFR tumors has been shown to be marginal. Methods that can sensitize EGFR-TKIs to EGFR wild-type NSCLC remain rare. Hence, we determined whether combination treatment can maximize the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. We established a focused drug screening system to investigate candidates for overcoming the intrinsic resistance of wild-type EGFR NSCLC to EGFR-TKIs. Molecular docking assays and western blotting were used to identify the binding mode and blocking effect of the candidate compounds. Proliferation assays, analyses of drug interactions, colony formation assays, flow cytometry and nude mice xenograft models were used to determine the effects and investigate the molecular mechanism of the combination treatment. Betulinic acid (BA) is effective at targeting EGFR and synergizes with EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and osimertinib) preferentially against wild-type EGFR. BA showed inhibitory activity due to its interaction with the ATP-binding pocket of EGFR and dramatically enhanced the suppressive effects of EGFR-TKIs by blocking EGFR and modulating the EGFR-ATK-mTOR axis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the combination strategy activated EGFR-induced autophagic cell death and that the EGFR-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway was essential for completing autophagy and cell cycle arrest. Activation of the mTOR pathway or blockade of autophagy by specific chemical agents markedly attenuated the effect of cell cycle arrest. In vivo administration of the combination treatment caused marked tumor regression in the A549 xenografts. BA is a potential wild-type EGFR inhibitor that plays a critical role in sensitizing EGFR-TKI activity. BA combined with an EGFR-TKI effectively suppressed the proliferation and survival of intrinsically resistant lung cancer cells via the inhibition of EGFR as well as the induction of autophagy-related cell death, indicating that BA combined with an EGFR-TKI may be a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming the primary resistance of wild-type EGFR-positive lung cancers.",

NSCLC cells can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by many factors in the tumour microenvironment (TME), which plays a crucial role in tumour drug resistance. In this study, a multicellular lung-on-a-chip that can realise the cell co-culture of the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line HCC827, human foetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) is prepared. The TME was simulated on the chip combined with perfusion and other factors, and the drug evaluation of osimertinib was performed to explore the drug resistance mechanism of EGFR-TKIs. In the early stages, a two-dimensional static cell co-culture was achieved by microchip, and the results showed that HFL-1 cells could be transformed into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and HCC827 cells could undergo EMT, both of which were mediated by Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Vimentin (VIM) and Alpha Skeletal Muscle Actin (a-SMA) expression of HFL-1 was upregulated, whereas E-cadherin (E-cad) expression of HCC827 was down-regulated. Further, N-cadherin (N-cad) expression of HCC827 was upregulated. In both the static cell co-culture and multicellular lung-on-a-chip, HCC827 cells with CAFs co-culture or IL-6 treatment developed resistance to osimertinib. Further use of the IL-6 antibody inhibitor tocilizumab could reverse EGFR-TKI resistance to a certain extent. Combination therapy with tocilizumab and EGFR-TKIs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance caused by EMT in NSCLC. Furthermore, the lung-on-a-chip can simulate complex TME and can be used for evaluating tumour resistance and exploring mechanisms, with the potential to become an important tool for personalised diagnosis, treatment, and biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib (Osi) is a widely used epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, the emergence of resistance is inevitable, partly due to the gradual evolution of adaptive resistant cells during initial treatment. Here, we find that Osi treatment rapidly triggers adaptive resistance in tumor cells. Metabolomics analysis reveals a significant enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Osi adaptive-resistant cells. Mechanically, Osi treatment induces an elevation of NCOA4, a key protein of ferritinophagy, which maintains the synthesis of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) proteins of electron transport chain and OXPHOS. Additionally, active ISC protein synthesis in adaptive-resistant cells significantly increases the sensitivity to copper ions. Combining Osi with elesclomol, a copper ion ionophore, significantly increases the efficacy of Osi, with no additional toxicity. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanisms of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in Osi adaptive resistance and introduces a promising new therapy of combining copper ionophores to improve its initial efficacy.",

    "abstract": "In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with negative or low programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, the acquisition rate of the T790M mutation is higher after treatment with first-/second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the progression-free survival (PFS) is longer in patients treated with osimertinib. The present study compared the clinical course after the initiation of each EGFR-TKI monotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 expression. Data of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 expression who were treated with EGFR-TKI monotherapy were retrieved and retrospectively analyzed. Between June 2013 and November 2023, 26 and 29 patients were treated with first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and osimertinib, respectively. The PFS time was longer in patients treated with osimertinib (median, 22.5 months) than in those treated with first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs (median, 12.9 months). However, the EGFR-TKI treatment duration, defined as the PFS for osimertinib, or the sum of the PFS for first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and sequential osimertinib therapy after the acquisition of the T790M mutation, was similar between patients treated with first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs (median, 23.0 months) and osimertinib (median, 22.5 months). The Cox proportional hazard model suggested that there was no significant difference in the EGFR-TKI treatment duration between patients treated with first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and patients treated with osimertinib (hazard ratio, 1.31, 95% CI, 0.55-3.13). In conclusion, first-/second-generation EGFR-TKIs and osimertinib were associated with a similar EGFR-TKI treatment duration in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 expression. The findings suggested that both treatments are promising for this population.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib has demonstrated efficacy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical trials. However, real-world data on its effectiveness remain scarce. Taiwanese patients with T790M-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and progressive disease following treatment with at least one EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were enrolled from the osimertinib early access program. Of the 419 patients (mean age, 63 years; female, 67%), 53% were heavily pretreated (\u2265 third-line [3L]), making osimertinib a fourth-line (4L) intervention. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.95-11.41); the 18-month PFS rate was 26.5%. The median overall survival (OS) was 19.0 months (95% CI: 16.30-20.95); the 24-month OS rate was 40.9%. The objective response rate was 32.46%, and the disease control rate was 86.38%. The median time to treatment discontinuation of osimertinib monotherapy was 11.9 months (95% CI: 10.49-13.11). Subgroup analyses of median PFS and OS in the chemotherapy combination group vs. the osimertinib monotherapy group yielded no difference. Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, number of prior lines of therapy, and types of initial EGFR-TKIs did not significantly impact outcomes. The median PFS values were 9.0 (95% CI: 5.18-11.34) and 10.9 (95% CI: 9.18-11.90) months with and without CNS metastasis, respectively, and 10.8 (95% CI: 8.59-12.69), 13.6 (95% CI: 10.89-16.3), and 9.2 (95% CI: 7.8-10.62) months for second-line (2L), 3L, and \u22654L therapy, respectively. In patients who received osimertinib as 2L therapy, the median PFS values in response to prior afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib treatment were 11.2 (95% CI: 4.85-4.79), 10.5 (95% CI: 8.59-20.26) and 8.7 (95% CI: 7.21-16.79) months, respectively.

    "title": "Mechanistic insights into Yifei Sanjie pill's regulation of EMT to enhance gefitinib treatment effect in NSCLC by in silico analysis and experimental validation.",
    "abstract": "The Yi-Fei San-Jie pill (YFSJ) is a well-known Chinese medicine that has been used to treat non-small cell lung cancer in China for decades. Previous studies have shown that YFSJ combined with gefitinib can effectively inhibit the proliferation of gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines by promoting apoptosis and autophagy, but the molecular biological mechanisms involved and whether YFSJ combined with gefitinib can have synergistic effects still need to be further explored. Thus, the present study aimed to establish an in silico and experimental framework to decipher the underlying mechanism by which YFSJ augments the efficacy of gefitinib in treating NSCLC. Integrated approaches, including microarray analysis, network pharmacology, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics algorithm analysis and in vivo and in vitro experiments, were applied to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Analysis of microarray datasets indicated that gefitinib may play a role in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC9 cells. EMT-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms and the MAPK pathway were found to be enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and a decreasing trend was observed in the EMT score. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that the potential NSCLC-related targets of YFSJ also showed enrichment in EMT-related GO terms and the MAPK pathway. Experimental findings demonstrated that combined YFSJ-treated serum and gefitinib treatment significantly inhibited PC9 cell migration and invasion. In addition, the combined treatment dramatically reduced the tumour volume in an animal model. The effectiveness of the combination treatment surpassed that of gefitinib alone in both cell and animal experiments. RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant enrichment of DEGs in EMT-related GO terms for the gefitinib treatment group, YFSJ treatment group, and combination treatment group compared to the control group. Notably, the negative regulation of EMT showed significant enrichment in the DEGs of the combination treatment group. The MAPK pathway was significantly enriched among the different groups. Moreover, combined treatment with YFSJ and gefitinib may exert synergistic anti-NSCLC effects by inhibiting the p-p38 MAPK/GSK3\u03b2 signalling axis, subsequently suppressing downstream EMT processes. Combined treatment with YFSJ and gefitinib could enhance the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib by suppressing EMT through the EGFR/p-p38 MAPK/GSK3\u03b2 signalling axis. YFSJ may serve as an important adjunctive medication for NSCLC patients receiving gefitinib treatment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous adverse reactions to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi) are some of the most common side effects that patients experience. However, cutaneous adverse reactions that cause dyspigmentation in patients have been rarely reported. Erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP) is a rare pigmentary condition that causes ashy-grey hyperpigmented macules and patches, with a few cases reported from EGFRi in the literature. The disfiguration caused by this condition may negatively impact patients' quality of life. Our study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of EDP induced by EGFRi to better recognize and manage the condition. We conducted a multicenter retrospective review at three academic institutions to identify patients with EDP induced by EGFRi from 2017 to 2023 and included sixteen patients in our study. The median age of patients was 66\u00a0years old, with 63% female and 37% male (Table\u00a01). The majority of our patients were Asian (88%). All patients had non-small cell lung cancer and most patients received osimertinib. Median time to EDP was 6\u00a0months. The most common areas of distribution were the head/neck region, lower extremities, and upper extremities. Various topical ointments were trialed; however, approximately less than half had improvement in their disease and most patients had persistent EDP with no resolution. All patients desired treatment except one with EDP on the tongue, and there was no cancer treatment discontinuation or interruption due to EDP.

    "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is subject to exportin 1 (XPO1)-dependent nuclear export, and it is involved in functions implicated in resistance to immunotherapy. We investigated whether HMGB1 mRNA expression was associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RNA was isolated from pretreatment biopsies of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICI. Gene expression analysis of several genes, including HMGB1, was conducted using the NanoString Counter analysis system (PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel). Western blotting analysis and cell viability assays in EGFR and KRAS mutant cell lines were carried out. Evaluation of the antitumoral effect of ICI in combination with XPO1 blocker (selinexor) and trametinib was determined in a murine Lewis lung carcinoma model. HMGB1 mRNA levels in NSCLC patients treated with ICI correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS 9.0 versus 18.0 months, P=0.008, hazard ratio=0.30 in high versus low HMGB1). After TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, HMGB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm of PC9 cells, but this accumulation can be prevented by using selinexor or antiretroviral drugs. Erlotinib or osimertinib with selinexor in EGFR-mutant cells and trametinib plus selinexor in KRAS mutant abolish tumor cell proliferation. Selinexor with a PD-1 inhibitor with or without trametinib abrogates the tumor growth in the murine Lewis lung cancer model. An in-depth exploration of the functions of HMGB1 mRNA and protein is expected to uncover new potential targets and provide a basis for treating metastatic NSCLC in combination with ICI.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inevitably develop resistance through several biological mechanisms. However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to suboptimal EGFR-TKI doses, due to pharmacodynamics leading to inadequate drug exposure. To evaluate the effects of suboptimal EGFR-TKI exposure on resistance in NSCLC, we obtained HCC827 and PC9 cell lines resistant to suboptimal fixed and intermittent doses of gefitinib and compared them to cells exposed to higher doses of the drug. We analyzed the differences in terms of EGFR signaling activation and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, whole transcriptomes byRNA sequencing, and cell motility. We observed that the exposure to low doses of gefitinib more frequently induced a partial EMT associated with an induced migratory ability, and an enhanced transcription of cancer stem cell markers, particularly in the HCC827 gefitinib-resistant cells. Finally, the HCC827 gefitinib-resistant cells showed increased secretion of the EMT inducer transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, whose inhibition was able to partially restore gefitinib sensitivity. These data provide evidence that different levels of exposure to EGFR-TKIs in tumor masses might promote different mechanisms of acquired resistance.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) characterized by poor prognosis and short survival. A variety of therapeutic approaches have been sought to improve the efficacy of LM. Here we present a clinical case and conduct a literature review to investigate the effectiveness and safety of double-dose osimertinib combined with a pemetrexed intrathecal injection. This is an older man who underwent thoracoscopic pneumonectomy and was diagnosed with stage IIA lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR21 L858R mutation. He experienced thoracic vertebral metastases 33 months postoperatively and received first-line treatment with gefitinib combined with radiotherapy for vertebral metastases. However, the patient developed a grade 3 rash with unacceptable toxicity and his CEA levels were significantly increased 22 months later, leading to a targeted treatment adjustment to 80 mg of osimertinib orally once daily. Four months later, the patient developed LM and osimertinib dosage was increased to 160 mg once daily; however, neurological symptoms did not improve, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor cells remained detected. Accordingly, the patient received an intrathecal injection of pemetrexed (dose 30 mg) every 2-3 months, 2-3 times per course (4-6 days each time), and continued to receive a double dose of osimertinib. After three courses of intrathecal chemotherapy, CSF tumor cells were eliminated, and neurological symptoms significantly improved. During the treatment, he experienced a one-degree rash, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. This patient has been alive and well with disease control for 28 months since the diagnosis of meningeal metastases. Combining double-dose osimertinib and an intrathecal injection of pemetrexed demonstrated therapeutic efficacy and manageable adverse effects in this patient with advanced NSCLC with EGFR-mutant and LM.",

    "title": "Therapeutic drug monitoring of osimertinib in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer by dried blood spot and plasma collection: A pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has led to significant improvements in individualized medical care, although its implementation in oncology has been limited to date. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a group of therapies for which TDM has been suggested. Osimertinib is one such therapy used in the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-driven lung cancer. Herein, we describe a prospective pilot study involving 21 patients on osimertinib primarily as a preliminary evaluation of drug levels in a real-world setting. Concentrations of the drug and its primary metabolites were measured with a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay across serial timepoints. As part of this study, inter-individual variability by dose and ethnicity as well as intra-individual variability across timepoints are explored. Furthermore, we attempted to validate dried blood spot (DBS)-based quantitation as an accurate alternative to plasma quantitation. Successful quantitation of osimertinib and primary metabolites was achieved for our subjects. Compound plasma levels were highly correlated to DBS levels. There was no significant difference in concentrations with ethnicity or dosing or intra-individual variability across timepoints. As such, we demonstrate that TDM for osimertinib is practical for future trials. We also validated the use of DBS as an alternative to conventional quantitation for exploration of TDM for osimertinib in larger trials and for other targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) caused more deaths in 2017 than breast cancer, prostate, and brain cancers combined. This is primarily due to their aggressive metastatic nature, leading to more fatal rates of cancer patients. Despite this condition, there are no clinically approved drugs that can target metastasis. The NSCLC with EGFR T790M-overexpressing HER2 shows the resistance to osimertinib and trastuzumab starting 10-18 months after the therapy, and thus prospects are grim to these patients. To target the recalcitrant ERBB2 driver oncogene, we developed two engineered destabilizing 3'UTR ERBB2 constructs that degrade the endogenous ERBB2 transcript and proteins by overwriting the encoded endogenous ERBB2 mRNA with the destabilizing message. When iron oxide nanocages (IO nanocages) were used as vehicles to deliver them to tumors and whole tissues in mice bearing tumors, it was well tolerated and safe and caused no genome rearrangement whereas they were integrated into genome deserts (non-coding regions). We achieved significant reduction of the primary tumor volume with desARE3'UTRERBB2-30, achieving 50% complete tumor lysis and inhibiting 60%-80% of liver metastasis, hepatomegaly, and 90% of lung metastasis, through ERBB2 downregulation. These constructs were distributed robustly into tumors, livers, lungs, kidneys, and spleen and mildly in the brain and not in the heart. They caused no abnormality in both short- and long-term administrations as well as in healthy mice. In summary, we accomplished significant breakthrough for the therapeutics of intractable lung cancer patients whose cancers become resistant and metastasize.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a selective third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), effectively targets the EGFR T790M mutant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the newly identified EGFR C797S mutation confers resistance to osimertinib. In this study, we explored the role of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) in osimertinib resistance. Patients exhibiting osimertinib resistance initially displayed elevated PDK1 expression. Osimertinib-resistant cell lines with the EGFR C797S mutation were established using A549, NCI-H292, PC-9, and NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells for both in vitro and in vivo investigations. These EGFR C797S mutant cells exhibited heightened phosphorylation of EGFR, leading to the activation of downstream oncogenic pathways. The EGFR C797S mutation appeared to increase PDK1-driven glycolysis through the EGFR/AKT/HIF-1\u03b1 axis. Combining osimertinib with the PDK1 inhibitor leelamine helped successfully overcome osimertinib resistance in allograft models. CRISPR-mediated PDK1 knockout effectively inhibited tumor formation in xenograft models. Our study established a clear link between the EGFR C797S mutation and elevated PDK1 expression, opening new avenues for the discovery of targeted therapies and improving our understanding of the roles of EGFR mutations in cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explored the clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR Exon20 in-frame insertions (Exon20ins), and the impact of the location of Exon20ins on these clinical outcomes. The efficacies of current systemic therapies in NSCLC patients harboring Exon20ins were investigated using a large-scale clinico-genomic database of LC-SCRUM-Asia, and compared with that of amivantamab in the CHRYSALIS trial. Of the 11,397 patients enrolled in LC-SCRUM-Asia, Exon20ins were detected in 189 patients (1.7\u00a0%). Treatment with classical EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (classical TKIs) was associated with a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients with Exon20ins as compared with Exon19 deletions and L858R. Post platinum-based chemotherapy, classical TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were associated with a shorter PFS than with docetaxel in patients with Exon20ins (HR [95\u00a0% CI]; TKIs vs docetaxel, 2.16 [1.35-3.46]; ICIs vs docetaxel, 1.49 [1.21-1.84]). Patients treated with amivantamab in the CHRYSALIS trial showed a risk reduction in PFS and overall survival as compared with LC-SCRUM-Asia patients treated with docetaxel, classical TKIs, or ICIs. Among the 189 patients, Exon20ins were classified as near-loop or far-loop insertions in 115 (61\u00a0%) and 56 (30\u00a0%) patients, respectively. Treatment with osimertinib was associated with a longer PFS in patients with Exon20ins in near-loop as compared with far-loop (median, 5.6 vs. 2.0\u00a0months; HR [95\u00a0% CI], 0.22 [0.07-0.64]). After platinum-based chemotherapy, classical TKIs and ICIs are less effective in NSCLC patients with Exon20ins, and amivantamab may be a promising targeted therapy. There is a possibility that the location of Exon20ins has an impact on the efficacy of TKIs.",

Now we recognize that the interactions between the tumor and the tumor microenvironment (TME) also account for drug resistance. Therefore, we provide a new sight into post-osimertinib management, focusing on the alteration of TME. We conducted a retrospective study on the prognosis of different treatments after osimertinib resistance. Next, we carried out in vivo experiment to validate our findings using a humanized mouse model. Furthermore, we performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tumor tissue from the above treatment groups to explore the mechanisms of TME changes. Totally 111 advanced NSCLC patients have been enrolled in the retrospective study. The median PFS was 9.84 months (95% CI 7.0-12.6 months) in the osimertinib plus anti-angiogenesis group, significantly longer than chemotherapy (P = 0.012) and osimertinib (P = 0.003).

The efficacy of osimertinib plus anlotinib in the osimertinib-resistant engraft tumors (R-O+A) group was significantly more potent than the osimertinib (R-O) group (P<0.05) in vitro. The combinational therapy could significantly increase the infiltration of CD4 In conclusion, osimertinib plus anlotinib could improve the prognosis of patients with a progressed disease on second-line osimertinib treatment, which may ascribe to increased T cell infiltration and TAM remodeling via VEGF-VEGFR blockage.",

    "abstract": "HER3 (ErbB3), a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers. Multiple HER3-targeting antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) were developed for the solid tumor treatment, however none of HER3-targeting agent has been approved for tumor therapy yet. We developed DB-1310, a HER3 ADC composed of a novel humanized anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a proprietary DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (P1021), and evaluate the efficacy and safety of DB-1310 in preclinical models. The binding of DB-1310 to Her3 and other HER families were measured by ELISA and SPR. The competition of binding epitope for DB-1310 and patritumab was tested by FACS. The sensitivity of breast, lung, prostate and colon cancer cell lines to DB-1310 was evaluated by in vitro cell killing assay. In vivo growth inhibition study evaluated the sensitivity of DB-1310 to Her3\u2009+\u2009breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer xenograft models. The safety profile was also measured in cynomolgus monkey. DB-1310 binds HER3 via a novel epitope with high affinity and internalization capacity. In vitro, DB-1310 exhibited cytotoxicity in numerous HER3\u2009+\u2009breast, lung, prostate and colon cancer cell lines. In vivo studies in HER3\u2009+\u2009HCC1569 breast cancer, NCI-H441 lung cancer and Colo205 colon cancer xenograft models showed DB-1310 to have dose-dependent tumoricidal activity. Tumor suppression was also observed in HER3\u2009+\u2009non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Moreover, DB-1310 showed stronger tumor growth-inhibitory activity than patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), which is another HER3 ADC in clinical development at the same dose. The tumor-suppressive activity of DB-1310 synergized with that of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib, and exerted efficacy also in osimertinib-resistant PDX model. The preclinical assessment of safety in cynomolgus monkeys further revealed DB-1310 to have a good safety profile with a highest non severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of 45\u00a0mg/kg. These finding demonstrated that DB-1310 exerted potent antitumor activities against HER3\u2009+\u2009tumors in in vitro and in vivo models, and showed acceptable safety profiles in nonclinical species. Therefore, DB-1310 may be effective for the clinical treatment of HER3\u2009+\u2009solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of EGFR-mutated (EGFRm)-driven lung adenocarcinomas. Osimertinib significantly improves progression-free survival in first-line-treated patients with EGFRm advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the durable disease control, the majority of patients receiving osimertinib eventually develop disease progression. ctDNA profiling analysis of on-progression plasma samples from patients treated with osimertinib in both first- (phase III, FLAURA trial) and second-line trials (phase III, AURA3 trial) revealed a high prevalence of PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alterations. In vitro and in vivo evidence using CRISPR-engineered NSCLC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models supports a functional role for PIK3CA and PTEN mutations in the development of osimertinib resistance. These alterations are functionally relevant as EGFRm NSCLC cells with engineered PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alterations develop resistance to osimertinib and can be resensitized by treatment with the combination of osimertinib and the AKT inhibitor capivasertib. Moreover, xenograft and PDX in vivo models with PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alterations display limited sensitivity to osimertinib relative to models without alterations, and in these double-mutant models, capivasertib and osimertinib combination elicits an improved antitumor effect versus osimertinib alone. Together, this approach offers a potential treatment strategy for patients with EGFRm-driven NSCLC who have a suboptimal response or develop resistance to osimertinib through PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alterations.

The expression of selected differentially expressed circRNAs was verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in paired osimertinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cell lines, and in plasma samples of osimertinib-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC patients. We found that circMYBL1(has_circ_0136924) was downregulated after acquired resistance to osimertinib, inhibiting circMYBL1 expression facilitated the proliferation, migration, and invasion in osimertinib-sensitive NSCLC cells.

    "title": "A Path to Persistence after EGFR Inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Residual cancer cells persist even after targeted therapies, serving as a reservoir for the subsequent acquisition of genetic alterations that lead to acquired drug resistance and tumor relapse. These initial drug-tolerant persisters (DTP) are phenotypically heterogenous with transient phenotypes attributed to epigenetic, metabolic, and cell-cycle changes. DTPs are responsible for the inevitable relapse seen in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite high initial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. While past in vitro studies identified diverse drivers of drug-tolerant persistence to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC, the resultant phenotypic plasticity is not well understood and in vivo models of persistence are lacking. In this issue of Cancer Research, Hu and colleagues used patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer treated with the third-generation TKI osimertinib to investigate mechanisms of persistence at the time of maximal response. Using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, the authors identified a DTP transcriptional cluster mediated by the key neuroendocrine lineage transcription factor ASCL1, which triggers an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcriptional program. ASCL1 overexpression increased osimertinib tolerance in vitro as well, apparently independent of its role in neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, the ability of ASCL1 to induce persistence was context dependent as this occurred only in epigenetically permissive cells. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of DTP heterogeneity seen after osimertinib treatment and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a standard treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is highly effective for brain metastases (BMs). However, it is unclear whether local treatment (LT) for BMs prior to osimertinib administration improves survival in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. We aimed to reveal the survival benefit of upfront local treatment (LT) for BMs in patients treated with osimertinib. This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive patients with EGFR mutation (19del or L858R)-positive NSCLC who had BMs before osimertinib initiation between August 2018 and October 2021. We compared overall survival (OS) and central nervous system progression-free survival (CNS-PFS) between patients who received upfront LT for BMs (the upfront LT group), and patients who received osimertinib only (the osimertinib-alone group). Inverse-probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to adjust for potential confounding factors. Of the 121 patients analyzed, 57 and 64 patients had 19del and L858R, respectively. Forty-five and 76 patients were included in the upfront LT group and the osimertinib-alone groups, respectively. IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the OS of the upfront LT group was significantly longer than that of the osimertinib-alone group (median, 95\u00a0% confidence intervals [95\u00a0%CI]: Not reached [NR], NR-NR vs. 31.2, 21.7-33.2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The hazard ratio (HR) for OS and CNS-PFS was 0.37 (95\u00a0%CI, 0.16-0.87) and 0.36 (95\u00a0%CI, 0.15-0.87), respectively. The OS and CNS-PFS of patients who received upfront LT for BMs followed by osimertinib were significantly longer than those of patients who received osimertinib alone. Upfront LT for BMs may be beneficial in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with osimertinib.",

We constructed lncRNA-mRNA co-expression networks and identified key modules and their enriched biological functions. Processes enriched in the selected modules included RHO (A, B, C) GTPase and regulatory signaling pathways, apoptosis, inflammatory and interleukin signaling pathways, cell adhesion, cell migration, cell and extracellular matrix organization, metabolism, and lipid metabolism.

Disease-free survival increased significantly with immunotherapy and chemotherapy registered in perioperative treatments, as well as adjuvant registered immunotherapy and targeted therapy (osimertinib) in case of EGFR mutation. In oncogenic-addictive metastatic NSCLC, primarily in adenocarcinoma, the range of targeted therapies is expanding, with which the expected overall survival increases significantly, measured in years. By 2021, the FDA and EMA have approved targeted agents to inhibit EGFR activating mutations, T790 M resistance mutation, BRAF V600E mutation, ALK, ROS1, NTRK and RET fusion. In 2022, the range of authorized target therapies was expanded. With therapies that inhibit KRASG12C, EGFR exon 20, HER2 and MET. Until now, there was no registered targeted therapy for the KRAS mutations, which affect 30% of adenocarcinomas. Thus, the greatest expectation surrounded the inhibition of the KRAS G12C mutation, which occurs in \u223c15% of NSCLC, mainly in smokers and is characterized by a poor prognosis. Sotorasib and adagrasib are approved as second-line agents after at least one prior course of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Adagrasib in first-line combination with pembrolizumab immunotherapy proved more beneficial, especially in patients with high expression of PD-L1. In EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation of lung adenocarcinoma, amivantanab was registered for progression after platinum-based chemotherapy. Lung adenocarcinoma carries an EGFR exon 20, HER2 insertion mutation in 2%, for which the first targeted therapy is trastuzumab deruxtecan, in patients already treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Two orally administered selective c-MET inhibitors, capmatinib and tepotinib, were also approved after chemotherapy in adenocarcinoma carrying MET exon 14 skipping mutations of about 3%. Incorporating reflex testing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) expands personalized therapies by identifying guideline-recommended molecular alterations.",

It is an epithelial lung cancer that affects about 2.2 million people across the globe, according to International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Non-small cell lung cancer is a malignant tumor caused by EGFR mutation that occurs in the in-frame deletion of exon 19 and L858R point mutation in exon 21. Presently, clinically available inhibitors of EGFR (including erlotinib, lapatinib, gefitinib, selumetinib, etc.) are not specific and responsible for undesirable adverse effects. Moreover, to solve this problem search for newer EGFR inhibitors is the utmost need for the treatment and/or management of increasing lung cancer burden. The discovery of therapeutic agents that inhibit the specific target in tumorous cells, such as EGFR, is one of the successful strategies in treating many cancer therapies, including lung cancer. The exhaustive literature survey (2018-2023) has shown the importance of medicinally privileged pyrimidine derivatives together, fused and/or clubbed with other heterocyclic rings to design and develop novel EGFR inhibitors. Pyrimidine derivatives substituted with phenylamine, indole, pyrrole, piperazine, pyrazole, thiophene, pyridine and quinazoline derivatives substituted with phenylamine, pyrimidine, morpholine, pyrrole, dioxane, acrylamide, indole, pyridine, furan, pyrimidine, pyrazole etc. are privileged heterocyclic rings shown promising activity by inhibiting EGFR and TKIs.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that loss of the EGFR T790M gene mutation may contribute to the development of resistance to Osimertinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aims to assess the relationship between the clinical effectiveness of Osimertinib in NSCLC patients and the T790M mutation status following resistance to Osimertinib and examine differences between plasma and tissue tests and between Asian and non-Asian groups. The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for studies on the association between T790M mutation status and the efficacy of Osimertinib between January 2014 and November 2023. Meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.4 software. After evaluating 2727 articles, a total of 14 studies were included in the final analysis. Positive correlations between EGFR T790M mutation status after Osimertinib resistance and longer PFS (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.30-0.66), longer OS (HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.10-0.86), longer TTD (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45-1.07), and improved clinical outcomes including PFS and TTD subgroups (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47-0.73) were observed. Subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with the blood tests, the results of the T790M mutation tests by the tissue are more significant (HR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.52 for tissue tests; HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-1.00 for plasma tests), and the PFS of Osimertinib were similar for Asian and non-Asian patients (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.68 for Asians; HR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.01-1.27 for non-Asians). Persistence of the T790M gene mutation after the development of Osimertinib resistance is associated with higher therapeutic benefits of Osimertinib in NSCLC patients. The results of tissue detection are more significant than those of plasma detection.",

    "abstract": "Current research in EGFR-mutated NSCLC focuses on the management of drug resistance and uncommon mutations, as well as on the opportunity to extend targeted therapies' field of action to earlier stages of disease. We conducted a review analyzing literature from the PubMed database with the aim to describe the current state of art in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC, but also to explore new strategies under investigation. To this purpose, we collected recruiting phase II-III trials registered on Clinicaltrials.govand conducted on EGFR-mutated NSCLC both in early and advanced stage. With this review, we want to provide an exhaustive overview of current and new potential treatments in EGFR-mutated NSCLC, with emphasis on the most promising newly investigated strategies, such as association therapies in the first-line setting involving EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy (FLAURA2) or drugs targeting different driver pathways (MARIPOSA). We also aimed at unearthing challenges to achieve in this field, specifically the need to fully exploit already available compounds while developing new ones, the management of new emerging toxicities and the necessity to improve our biological understanding of the disease to design trials with a solid scientific rationale and to allow treatment personalization such in case of uncommon mutations.",

    "abstract": "EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are the first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, which remarkably improve the clinical outcomes. However, drug resistance has greatly impaired the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs and contributes to cancer treatment failure. DUSP1, a negative regulator of MAPK signaling pathway, was discovered to mediate drug resistance in multiple types of cancers. Our study aimed to explore the role of DUSP1 in NSCLC cell resistance to osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI.\u00a0Human NSCLC cell lines PC-9 and HCC827 were exposed to increasing concentrations of osimertinib for over 6 months to generate osimertinib resistant cells (PC-9-OR and HCC827-OR). The viabilities of osimertinib-resistant and parental sensitive NSCLC cells in response to osimertinib stimulation were detected by MTS assay and the IC50 values for osimertinib were obtained. The differentially expressed genes in osimertinib-resistant and sensitive NSCLC cells were identified by analyzing the GEO dataset GSE106765 using bioinformatic tools. DUSP1 expression was knocked down by using the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Then, the effects of DUSP1 silencing on osimertinib-resistant and sensitive NSCLC cell resistance to osimertinib, viability, proliferation and apoptosis were assessed through loss-of-function experiments. The expression of key molecules (JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK) in the MAPK signaling pathway was detected through western blotting analysis.\u00a0DUSP1 was overexpressed in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells versus parental sensitive cells. DUSP1 silencing attenuated the resistance of NSCLC cells to osimertinib. DUSP1 silencing markedly inhibited osimertinib-resistant and sensitive NSCLC cell proliferation but enhanced cell apoptosis. Mechanically, DUSP1 knockdown increased phosphorylated-JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK levels in NSCLC cells. Treatment with SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, reversed the effects of DUSP1 silencing on osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell resistance to osimertinib, cell proliferation and apoptosis.\u00a0DUSP1 downregulation restores the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to osimertinib via activating the MAPK signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the clinical characteristics of bone metastasis (BoM) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and to identify the most effective treatment strategy using EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The study included patients with stage IV EGFR-mutated NSCLC who were receiving first-line treatment with EGFR-TKIs between January 2014 and December 2020. These patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of BoM at the time of initial diagnosis. The BoM group was further subdivided based on whether they received denosumab or not. The final analysis included 247 patients. Those with BoM at initial diagnosis had shorter progression-free survival (12.6 vs. 10.5\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and overall survival (OS) (49.7 vs. 30.9\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.002) compared to those without BoM. There was a difference in the location of metastatic sites between the two groups, with a higher incidence of extrathoracic metastasis in the BoM group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The incidence of T790M was higher in patients with BoM than in those without (47.4% vs. 33.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.042). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that sequential osimertinib treatment and the addition of antiangiogenic therapy (AAT) and denosumab therapy improved OS in patients with BoM. The presence of BoM is a negative prognostic factor for NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation, possibly due to the presence of extrathoracic metastases. However, adding AAT and denosumab, along with sequential osimertinib, to the treatment regimen for patients with BoM can improve survival outcomes.",

Molecular profiling was conducted in the tissue and plasma at the time of initial diagnosis, and subsequent repeated liquid biopsy examinations were planned after 10 days, 28 days, and at the time of radiological progression in the frame of the prospective translational study REM. These cases suggest that osimertinib may maintain its therapeutic effectiveness even in patients presenting with a baseline BRAF co-mutation.

In order to prevent or treat toxicity, the osimertinib dose may be reduced. However, data regarding the impact of dose reduction during treatment are limited. We aimed to compare the efficacy of osimertinib early dose reduction during the first 3\u2005months of treatment with late dose reduction in EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC. This retrospective study included patients with EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC who received osimertinib. We constituted two groups: 'early dose reduction' (early) with patients receiving a reduced dose of osimertinib from 80 to 40\u2005mg within the 3\u2005months of osimertinib initiation and 'late dose reduction' (late) with patients receiving a reduced dose after 3\u2005months of full-dose treatment.

    "abstract": "For critically ill patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in need of life-saving treatment, there is currently no reported evidence regarding the use of medication specifically targeting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) p.C797S mutation, which is known to cause resistance to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our report aims to investigate and explore treatment strategies to overcome resistance associated with EGFR p.C797S mutation in order to provide potential therapeutic options for these patients. Here, we reported two cases with NSCLC who initially harbored an EGFR -sensitive mutation and were both treated with osimertinib, a third-generation TKI. Next-generation sequencing tests conducted prior to the initiation of fifth-line therapy in critically ill patients revealed the presence of EGFR p.C797S mutations in both patients, suggesting acquired resistance. In the course of fifth-line therapy, the administration of a combination of brigatinib and cetuximab proved vital in saving critically ill patients, moderately extending their overall survival period. Our findings suggested that a combined regimen of brigatinib and cetuximab could serve as a potentially life-saving therapeutic strategy for critically ill patients with NSCLC, particularly those demonstrating EGFR p.C797S-mediated resistance. Further studies, however, are required to validate and expand upon these promising findings.",

To better understand the molecular basis for BI-4020 selectivity and potency, we have carried out biochemical activity assays and structural analysis with X-ray crystallography. Biochemical potencies agree with previous studies indicating that BI-4020 is uniquely potent against drug-resistant L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/C797S variants. X-ray structures with wild-type (2.4\u2005\u00c5) and T790M/V948R (3.1\u2005\u00c5) EGFR kinase domains show that BI-4020 is likely rendered selective due to interactions with the kinase domain hinge region as well as T790M, akin to Osimertinib. Additionally, BI-4020 is also rendered more potent due to its constrained macrocycle geometry as well as additional H-bonds to conserved K745 and T845 residues in both active and inactive conformations. These findings taken together show how this novel macrocyclic inhibitor is both highly potent and selective for mutant EGFR in a reversible mechanism and motivate structure-inspired approaches to developing targeted therapies in medicinal oncology.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting mutant EGFR, has received approval for initial treatment in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). While effective in both first- and second-line treatments, patients eventually develop acquired resistance. Metabolic reprogramming represents a strategy through which cancer cells may resist and adapt to the selective pressure exerted by the drug. In the current study, we investigated the metabolic adaptations associated with osimertinib-resistance in NSCLC cells under low glucose culture conditions. We demonstrated that, unlike osimertinib-sensitive cells, osimertinib-resistant cells were able to survive under low glucose conditions by increasing the rate of glucose and glutamine uptake and by shifting towards mitochondrial metabolism. Inhibiting glucose/pyruvate contribution to mitochondrial respiration, glutamine deamination to glutamate, and oxidative phosphorylation decreased the proliferation and survival abilities of osimertinib-resistant cells to glucose starvation. Our findings underscore the remarkable adaptability of osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cells in a low glucose environment and highlight the pivotal role of mitochondrial metabolism in mediating this adaptation. Targeting the metabolic adaptive responses triggered by glucose shortage emerges as a promising strategy, effectively inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death in osimertinib-resistant cells.",

In vitro experiment employing the H1975 cell line demonstrated a notable enhancement in cytotoxic efficacy when L-Methionine (10\u00a0mM) was combined with Gefitinib, as indicated by a substantial reduction in IC",

    "abstract": "The observational multicenter prospective FLOWER study (NCT04965701) confirmed effectiveness and safety of osimertinib in the real-world (RW) management of untreated EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients. Herein, we report updated survival data, post-progression management, cost/effectiveness and budget impact (BI) of osimertinib compared with a RW population receiving gefitinib or erlotinib. Overall, 189 Caucasian patients receiving first-line osimertinib were included. After a follow-up of 20.7 months, 74(39.2%) patients discontinued osimertinib, median time-to-treatment discontinuation (mTTD) was 27.9 months, overall survival 36.8 months. At progression, tissue biopsy was performed in 29 (56.9%), liquid biopsy in 15 (29.4%) and both in 7 (13.7%) cases. The most frequent resistant mechanism was MET amplification (N\u2005=\u200514, 29.8%). At data cutoff, 13 (6.9%) patients were continuing osimertinib beyond progression; 52 (67.5%) received second-line treatment; no further treatments were administered in 25 (32.5%) cases. Thirty-three (63.4%) patients received chemotherapy, 12(23.1%) TKIs combination. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a total cost per patient based on RW mTTD of 98,957.34\u20ac, 21,726.28\u20ac and 19,637.83\u20ac for osimertinib, erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)/month for osimertinib was 359,806.0\u20ac/life-year-gained (LYG) and 197,789.77\u20ac/LYG compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. For osimertinib, the BI-gap between RW-TTD and theoretical-TTD was 16,501.0\u20ac per patient. This updated analysis confirms the effectiveness of osimertinib in RW. Although the ICER of osimertinib seems not cost-effective, additional costs for the management of disease progression to old generation TKIs were not considered in this study. The BI-gap suggests RW mTTD as a more reliable measure for expense estimation.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the standard of care for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Dose-toxicity has been previously reported, but no dose-response data within the range of 20-240\u00a0mg daily (mg/d). Thus, the current 80\u00a0mg/d dosing might be too high for elderly Japanese patients with an average body weight of only 50\u00a0kg, resulting in excessive toxicity and cost. We therefore initiated a study to investigate whether osimertinib at 40\u00a0mg/d is non-inferior to 80\u00a0mg/d in patients with advanced or recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer aged \u226570\u00a0years, using a regression discontinuity design. Osimertinib is administered at 40\u00a0mg/d for body weight \u226450\u00a0kg, and 80\u00a0mg/d for body weight >50\u00a0kg. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival.

The proportion of NSCLC patients whose treatment was selected based on genomic testing is still unknown in many countries or needs further improvement. This survey aimed to assess perception of genomic testing and targeted therapy for NSCLC in clinical pathologists and physicians across China. The web-based survey was conducted with 150 clinical pathologists and 450 physicians from oncology, respiratory and thoracic surgery departments from May to September 2020, across 135 cities in China. The participants had >5 years of clinical experience in genomic testing, diagnosis or treatment of NSCLC. Clinical pathologists reported capability of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS-1) testing as 95.3%, 94.7%, and 84.7%, respectively, but only 81.9%, 75.5%, and 65.6% of physicians believed that the pathology department of the hospital is capable of performing the testing. The proportions of sending out specimens for testing were 21.0% and 49.7% as reported from clinical pathologists and physicians, respectively. Testing for EGFR mutation was recommended by physicians most often, followed by ALK and ROS-1 rearrangement. As first-line treatment, among the newly diagnosed patients with EGFR mutation, 77% received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) therapy (49% treated with gefitinib); among patients with ALK rearrangement, 71% received TKI (64% treated with crizotinib); among patients with ROS-1 fusion, 65% received TKI (88% treated with crizotinib). The improvement of the non-tertiary hospital pathology departments' detection capabilities and the physicians' awareness are needed for enhancing the rate of genomic testing and targeted therapy in NSCLC patients in China.",

    "abstract": "The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib has been approved for the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Despite its efficacy, patients develop resistance. Mechanisms of resistance are heterogeneous and not fully understood, and their characterization is essential to find new strategies to overcome resistance. Ceramides are well-known regulators of apoptosis and are converted into glucosylceramides (GlcCer) by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS). A higher content of GlcCers was observed in lung pleural effusions from NSCLC patients and their role in osimertinib-resistance has not been documented. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting GCS in NSCLC EGFR-mutant models resistant to osimertinib in vitro and in vivo. Lipidomic analysis showed a significant increase in the intracellular levels of glycosylceramides, including GlcCers in osimertinib resistant clones compared to sensitive cells. In resistant cells, the GCS inhibitor PDMP caused cell cycle arrest, inhibition of 2D and 3D cell proliferation, colony formation and migration capability, and apoptosis induction. The intratumoral injection of PDMP completely suppressed the growth of OR xenograft models. This study demonstrated that dysregulation of ceramide metabolism is involved in osimertinib-resistance and targeting GCS may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients progressed to osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Uncommon EGFR mutations represent a rare subgroup of NSCLC. Data on the efficacy of different generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in these rare mutations are scattered and limited to mostly retrospective small cohorts because these patients were usually excluded from clinical trials. This was a systematic review on the efficacy of TKIs in patients harboring uncommon EGFR mutations, defined as mutations other than exon 20 insertions mutations or T790M. Response rates (RRs) for different generations of TKIs were determined for individual uncommon mutations, compound mutations, and according to classical-like and P-loop alpha helix compressing mutations classes. This study was conducted in accordance with the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 1836 patients from 38 studies were included in the final analysis. Most available data (92.6%) were from patients treated with first- or second-generation TKIs. G719X, S768I, E709X, L747X, and E709-T710delinsD showed RRs ranging from 47.8% to 72.3% to second-generation TKIs, generally higher than for first- or third-generation TKIs. L861Q mutation exhibited 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.6%-88.5%) RRs to third-generation TKIs. Compound mutations with G719X, E709X, or S768I consistently showed RRs above 50% to second- and third-generation TKIs, although fewer data were available for third generations. For classical-like mutations, RRs were 35.4% (95% CI: 27.2%-44.2%), 51.9% (95% CI: 44.4%-59.3%), and 67.9% (95% CI: 47.6%-84.1%) to first-, second-, and third-generation TKIs, whereas for P-loop alpha helix compressing mutations classes mutations, RRs were 37.2% (95% CI: 32.4%-42.1%), 59.6% (95% CI: 54.8%-64.3%), and 46.3% (95% CI: 32.6%-60.4%), respectively. This systematic review supports the use of second-generation TKI afatinib for G719X, S768I, E709X, and L747X mutations and for compound uncommon mutations. For other uncommon mutations such as L861Q, third-generation TKI, such as osimertinib, could also be considered, given its activity and toxicity profile.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TKIs) are producing impressive benefits to responsive types of cancers but challenged with drug resistances. FHND drugs are newly modified small molecule inhibitors based on the third-generation EGFR-TKI AZD9291 (Osimertinib) that are mainly for targeting the mutant-selective EGFR, particularly for the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Successful applications of EGFR-TKIs to other cancers are less certain, thus the present pre-clinical study aims to explore the anticancer effect and downstream targets of FHND in multiple myeloma (MM), which is an incurable hematological malignancy and reported to be insensitive to first/second generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib/Afatinib). Cell-based assays revealed that FHND004 and FHND008 significantly inhibited MM cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. The RNA-seq identified the involvement of the MAPK signaling pathway. The protein chip screened PDZ-binding kinase (PBK) as a potential drug target. The interaction between PBK and FHND004 was verified by molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay with site mutation (N124/D125). Moreover, the public clinical datasets showed high expression of PBK was associated with poor clinical outcomes. PBK overexpression evidently promoted the proliferation of two MM cell lines, whereas the FHND004 treatment significantly inhibited survival of 5TMM3VT cell-derived model mice and growth of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. The mechanistic study showed that FHND004 downregulated PBK expression, thus mediating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the MAPK pathway. Our study not only demonstrates PBK as a promising novel target of FHND004 to inhibit MM cell proliferation, but also expands the EGFR kinase-independent direction for developing anti-myeloma therapy.",

We present a case report of a 63-year-old patient with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who developed aplastic anemia following adjuvant treatment with Osimertinib. Extensive investigations ruled out infectious etiology, and the absence of bone marrow involvement or other identifiable causes suggested a drug-induced etiology, specifically Osimertinib. This case report emphasizes the importance of recognizing this adverse event and considering it as a potential complication of Osimertinib therapy. Vigilant monitoring and prompt management are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the risk factors, underlying mechanisms, and management strategies for Osimertinib-induced aplastic anemia in the adjuvant settings.",

    "abstract": "Development of effective strategies to manage the inevitable acquired resistance to osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of EGFR-mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is urgently needed. This study reports that DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors, doxorubicin and etoposide, synergistically decreased cell survival, with enhanced induction of DNA damage and apoptosis in osimertinib-resistant cells; suppressed the growth of osimertinib-resistant tumors; and delayed the emergence of osimertinib-acquired resistance. Mechanistically, osimertinib decreased Topo II\u03b1 levels in EGFRm NSCLC cells by facilitating FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation, resulting in induction of DNA damage; these effects were lost in osimertinib-resistant cell lines that possess elevated levels of Topo II\u03b1. Increased Topo II\u03b1 levels were also detected in the majority of tissue samples from patients with NSCLC after relapse from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Enforced expression of an ectopic TOP2A gene in sensitive EGFRm NSCLC cells conferred resistance to osimertinib, whereas knockdown of TOP2A in osimertinib-resistant cell lines restored their susceptibility to osimertinib-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Together, these results reveal an essential role of Topo II\u03b1 inhibition in mediating the therapeutic efficacy of osimertinib against EGFRm NSCLC, providing scientific rationale for targeting Topo II to manage acquired resistance to osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and osimertinib have primarily been used as first-line treatments for patients with EGFR-activating mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Novel biomarkers are required to distinguish patients with lung cancer who are resistant to EGFR-TKIs. The aim of the study is to investigate the expression and functional role of YES1, one of the Src-family kinases, in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC. YES1 expression was elevated in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 (HCC827/GR) cells, harboring EGFR mutations. Moreover, HCC827/GR cells exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels compared to those of the parent cells, resulting in the phosphorylation/activation of YES1 due to oxidation of the cysteine residue. HCC827/GR cells showed elevated expression levels of YES1-associated protein 1 (YAP1), NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), cancer stemness-related markers, and antioxidant proteins compared to those of the parent cells. Knockdown of YES1 in HCC827/GR cells suppressed YAP1 phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Cyclin D1 expression. Silencing YES1 markedly attenuated the proliferation, migration, and tumorigenicity of HCC827/GR cells. Dasatinib inhibited the proliferation of HCC827/GR cells by targeting YES1-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, the combination of gefitinib and dasatinib demonstrated a synergistic effect in suppressing the proliferation of HCC827/GR cells. Notably, YES1- and Nrf2-regulated genes showed a positive regulatory relationship in patients with lung cancer and in TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that modulation of YES1 expression and activity may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, aumolertinib, and furmonertinib, have been recommended as the preferred treatment for EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among them, furmonertinib shows several advantages in terms of clinical efficacy. Firstly, compared to osimertinib and aumolertinib, furmonertinib was the first EGFR-TKI with median progression-free survival (mPFS) of over 20.0\u00a0m (20.8\u00a0m) for advanced NSCLC with classical EGFR-mutations. Furthermore, furmonertinib achieved a mPFS of 18.1\u00a0m in advanced NSCLC with unfavorable prognostic factors, such as the 21 L858R mutation and central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, which is unrivalled by osimertinib. Secondly, furmonertinib is the only FDA-approved EGFR-TKI for breakthrough therapy in newly-diagnosed advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins mutation. Thirdly, the relatively longer mPFS of 20.8\u00a0m was observed in furmonertinib compared to osimertinib and aumolertinib (15.2\u00a0m and 15.3\u00a0m) in EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC with CNS metastases. More importantly, the efficacy of furmonertinib increases within the dose range of 80-240\u00a0mg per day. Finally, furmonertinib can be an optional treatment for advanced NSCLC patients who develop resistance to osimertinib or aumolertinib. In conclusion, furmonertinib may be a glittering star in the field of EGFR-TKI, which requires further exploration and expansion.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the classical resistance mechanisms, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase AXL is a main mechanism of resistance to third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) osimertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Developing an effective AXL inhibitor is important to sensitize osimertinib in clinical application. In this study we assessed the efficacy of brigatinib, a second-generation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-TKI, as a novel AXL inhibitor, in overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib induced by AXL activation. We established an AXL-overexpression NSCLC cell line and conducted high-throughput screening of a small molecule chemical library containing 510 anti-tumor drugs. We found that brigatinib potently inhibited AXL expression, and that brigatinib (0.5\u2009\u03bcM) significantly enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of\u00a0osimertinib (1\u2009\u03bcM) in AXL-mediated osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro. We demonstrated that brigatinib had a potential ability to bind AXL kinase protein and further inhibit its downstream pathways in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, we revealed that brigatinib might decrease AXL expression through increasing K48-linked ubiquitination of AXL and promoting AXL degradation in HCC827OR cells and PC-9OR cells.

The primary endpoint is progression free-survival (PFS) rate at 12 months, and secondary endpoints include: feasibility of alternating therapy, overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. The 12-month PFS rate is 38% (95% CI 27.5-55), not meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Serial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis reveals decrease and clearance of the original activating EGFR and EGFR-T790M mutations which are prognostic of clinical outcomes. In 73% of participants, loss of T790M ctDNA is observed at progression and no participants have evidence of the EGFR C797S resistance mutation following the alternating regimen. These findings highlight the challenges of treatment strategies designed to modulate clonal evolution and the clinical importance of resistance mechanisms beyond suppression of selected genetic mutations in driving therapeutic escape to highly potent targeted therapies.",

This retrospective study evaluated patients with EGFR mutations in exon 19 or 21 who received targeted therapy with osimertinib (80 mg per day) before surgery between January 2019 and October 2023 in Henan Cancer Hospital. Twenty patients were evaluated, all of whom underwent surgery. The rate of R0 resection was 100% (20/20). The objective response rate was 80% (16/20), and the disease control rate was 95% (19/20). Postoperative pathological analysis showed a 25% (5/20) major pathological response rate and 15% (3/20) pathological complete response rate. In total, 25% (5/20) developed adverse events (AEs), and the rate of grades 3-4 AEs was 10% (2/20). One patient experienced a grade 3 skin rash, and 1 patient experienced grade 3 diarrhea.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib shows pronounced efficacy for EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including associated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Tumors inevitably develop resistance to the drug, however. Osimertinib is sometimes readministered after completion of standard chemotherapy. To clarify which patients might receive benefit from osimertinib readministration, we have retrospectively assessed its efficacy with a focus on CNS metastases. A retrospective analysis of medical records was performed for 21 patients who underwent osimertinib readministration at Kyushu University Hospital between March 2016 and April 2023. CNS metastases were evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Among the 21 enrolled patients, 16 individuals had target lesions on the basis of RECIST. One (6.3%) of these 16 patients achieved a partial response to osimertinib readministration, with the remaining 15 patients showing stable or progressive disease. The median overall progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival for all 21 patients were 3.8 and 13.9 months, respectively. The efficacy of osimertinib readministration for CNS metastases was evaluable in eight patients including five individuals with leptomeningeal metastases. The objective response rate for CNS metastases and the improvement rate for leptomeningeal metastases were both 100%. The median PFS with regard to CNS or non-CNS lesions for these eight patients was 24.7 and 10.5 months, respectively. Osimertinib readministration showed limited efficacy for non-CNS lesions but excellent efficacy for CNS metastases, suggesting that such treatment is an option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with CNS metastases.",

    "abstract": "The third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib is widely used in EGFR-mutated positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but drug resistance is inevitable. The currently known mechanisms only explain resistance in a small proportion of patients. For most patients, the mechanism of osimertinib resistance is still unclear, especially for EGFR-independent resistance. Herein, we thoroughly investigated the novel mechanism of osimertinib resistance and treatment strategies. We identified that ST3GAL4, a sialyltransferase, catalyzes terminal glycan sialylation of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, which induces acquired resistance to osimertinib in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ST3GAL4 is generally overexpressed in osimertinib-resistant patients with unknown resistance mechanisms. ST3GAL4 modifies MET glycosylation on N785 with sialylation, which antagonizes K48-related ubiquitin-dependent MET degradation and subsequently activates MET and its downstream proliferation signaling pathways. Meanwhile, ST3GAL4 knockdown or inhibition by brigatinib resensitizes resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells to osimertinib in vitro and in vivo This study suggests that ST3GAL4 can induce acquired resistance to osimertinib, which may be an important EGFR-independent resistance mechanism Furthermore, targeting ST3GAL4 with brigatinib provides new strategies to overcome osimertinib resistance.",

Inhibiting energy metabolism of lung cancer cells is an important strategy to overcome drug resistance. Based on the cellular energy metabolism pathway, this study observed the effect of combination of shikonin(SKN) and gefitinib(GFB) on the drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer and explored the underlying mechanism. The human non-small cell lung cancer line HCC827/GR resistant to gefitinib was used as the cell model in vitro. The CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were employed to investigate the cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. The high performance liquid chromatography was employed to measure the intracellular accumulation of GFB. A Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer was used to detect the changes of cellular energy metabolism. Western blot was employed to determine the expression of the proteins involved in the drug resistance. The tumor-bearing nude mouse model was used to verify the efficacy of SKN+GFB in overcoming drug resistance in vivo. The results showed that SKN+GFB significantly reduced the IC_(50) of GFB on HCC827/GR cells, with the combination index of 0.628, indicating that the combination of the two drugs had a synergistic effect and promoted cell apoptosis. SKN increased the intracellular accumulation of GFB. SKN+GFB lowered the oxygen consumption rate(OCR) and glycolytic proton efflux rate(GlycoPER) in cell energy metabolism, and down-regulated the overexpression of PKM2, p-EGFR, P-gp, and HIF-1\u03b1 in drug resistance. The results of reversing drug resistance test in vivo showed that GFB or SKN alone had no significant antitumor effect, while the combination at different doses induced the apoptosis of the tumor tissue and inhibited the expression of PKM2 and P-gp, demonstrating a significant antitumor effect. Moreover, the tumor inhibition rate in the high-dose combination group reached 64.01%. In summary, SKN+GFB may interfere with the energy metabolism to limit the function of HCC827/GR cells, thus reversing the GFB resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "This study combined network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro experiments to explore the potential mechanism of the active components of the n-butanol fraction of Wenxia Formula(NWXF) combined with gefitinib(GEF) in treating non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS) was employed to detect the main chemical components of NWXF. The active components of NWXF were retrieved from SwissADME, and the candidate targets of these active components were retrieved from SwissTargetPrediction. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man(OMIM) and GeneCards were searched for the targets of NSCLC. Cytoscape 3.9.0 and STRING were employed to build the protein-protein interaction(PPI) network with the common targets shared by NWXF and NSCLC. Gene Ontology(GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) enrichment were performed in DAVID to predict the potential mechanisms. Finally, molecular docking between the main active ingredients and key targets was conducted in SYBYL-X 2.0. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay was employed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of NWXF and/or GEF on the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer cells(A549 and PC-9). Additionally, the impact of NWXF on human embryonic lung fibroblast cells(MRC-5) was assessed. The effectiveness of the drug combination was evaluated based on the Q value. The terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick-end labeling(TUNEL) assay was employed to examine the apoptosis of A549 and PC-9 cells treated with NWXF and/or GEF. Quantitative real-time PCR(qRT-PCR) was employed to measure the mRNA levels of epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK), and Bcl2-associated X protein(Bax) in the A549 and PC-9 cells treated with NWXF and/or GEF. Western blot was employed to determine the protein levels of EGFR, p-EGFR, JNK, p-JNK, and Bax in the A549 and PC-9 cells treated with NWXF and/or GEF. A total of 77 active components, 488 potential targets, and 49 key targets involved in the treatment of NSCLC with NWXF were predicted. The results of GO annotation showed that NWXF may treat NSCLC by regulating the biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and protein phosphorylation. KEGG enrichment revealed that the key targets of NWXF in treating NSCLC were enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)-protein kinase B(AKT), hypoxia-inducible factor-1(HIF-1), and microRNA-related signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that 91.9% of the docking scores were greater than 5, indicating the strong binding capability between main active components and key targets. The cell experiments demonstrated that NWXF combined with GEF synergistically inhibited the proliferation, promoted the apoptosis, decreased p-EGFR/EGFR and p-JNK/JNK values, down-regulated the mRNA levels of EGFR and JNK, and up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of Bax in A549 and PC-9 cells. In conclusion, NWXF combined with GEF can regulate the EGFR/JNK pathway to promote the apoptosis of NSCLC cells, thus treating NSCLC.",

Recent studies have indicated that the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) increases following gefitinib treatment, correlating with a poor patient response in NSCLC. Our study revealed that gefitinib treatment stimulates the production of CCL2, which subsequently enhances monocyte (M)-MDSC migration to tumor sites. Chidamide, a selective inhibitor of the histone deacetylase subtype, counteracted the gefitinib-induced increase in CCL2 levels in tumor cells. Additionally, chidamide down-regulated the expression of CCR2 in M-MDSCs, inhibiting their migration. Furthermore, chidamide attenuated the immunosuppressive function of M-MDSCs both alone and in combination with gefitinib. Chidamide also alleviated tumor immunosuppression by reducing the number of M-MDSCs in LLC-bearing mice, thereby enhancing the antitumor efficacy of gefitinib. In conclusion, our findings suggest that chidamide can improve gefitinib treatment outcomes, indicating that MDSCs are promising targets in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The development of acquired resistance to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has hindered their efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our previous study showed that constitutive activation of the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) contributes to the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines and xenograft tumors in nude mice. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying S6K1 constitutive activation in TKI-resistant cancer cells have not yet been explored. In this study, we recapitulated this finding by taking advantage of a gefitinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established through a number of passages in mice treated with increasing doses of gefitinib. The dissociated primary cells from the resistant PDX tumors (PDX-R) displayed higher levels of phosphor-S6K1 expression and were resistant to gefitinib compared to cells from passage-matched parental PDX tumors (PDX-P). Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of S6K1 increased sensitivity to gefitinib in PDX-R cells. In addition, both total and phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (MTOR) levels were upregulated in PDX-R and gefitinib-resistant PC9G cells. Knockdown of MTOR by siRNA decreased the expression levels of total and phosphor-S6K1 and increased sensitivity to gefitinib in PDX-R and PC9G cells. Moreover, a transcription factor ELK1, which has multiple predicted binding sites on the MTOR promoter, was also upregulated in PDX-R and PC9G cells, while the knockdown of ELK1 led to decreased expression of MTOR and S6K1. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assay showed the direct binding between ELK1 and the MTOR promoter, and the luciferase reporter assay further indicated that ELK1 could upregulate MTOR expression through tuning up its transcription. Silencing ELK1 via siRNA transfection improved the efficacy of gefitinib in PDX-R and PC9G cells. These results support the notion that activation of ELK1/MTOR/S6K1 signaling contributes to acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC. The findings in this study shed new light on the mechanism for acquired EGFR-TKI resistance and provide potential novel strategies by targeting the ELK1/MTOR/S6K1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Digital platforms for mutation detection yield higher sensitivity than non-digital platforms but lack universal positive cut-off values that correlate with the outcome of osimertinib treatment. This study determined compared droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to the standard cobas assay for epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation detection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Study patients had EGFR-mutant tumours with disease progression on first/second generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and osimertinib treatment after T790M mutation detection. T790M status was tested by cobas assay using liquid biopsy, and only by ddPCR if an EGFR mutation was identified but T790M was negative. Clinical efficacy of osimertinib was compared between patients with T790M detected by cobas vs. only by ddPCR. A positive cut-off value for ddPCR was determined by assessing efficacy with osimertinib. 61 patients had tumors with an acquired T790M mutation, 38 detected by cobas and an additional 23 only by ddPCR. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the cobas- and ddPCR-positive groups was 9.5 and 7.8 months, respectively (p=0.43). For ddPCR, a fractional abundance (FA) of 0.1% was used as a cut-off value. The median PFS of patients with FA \u22650.1% and <0.1% was 8.3 and 4.6 months, respectively (p=0.08). FA \u22650.1% was independently associated with a longer PFS. Using ddPCR to follow up the cobas assay yielded more cases (38% of total) with a T790M mutation. A cut-off value of FA \u22650.1% identified patients who responded as well to osimertinib as those identified by cobas assay. This sequential approach should detect additional patients who might benefit from osimertinib treatment.",

    "abstract": "Patients with radically resected stage II and III NSCLC are exposed to a high risk of disease recurrence. Thus, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is routinely offered to this patient population, although it results in an absolute increase in 5-year survival rate of only 4%. This modest improvement in survival rate makes it challenging to communicate to our patients about the decision to be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Nowadays, the decision to administer adjuvant chemotherapy or not in resected NSCLC is almost never completely shared with patients because its role is very difficult to explain. The risk-benefit ratio becomes clearly unfavourable in elderly and unfit patients. Recently, the phase III ADAURA trial demonstrated a clinically significant disease-free survival and overall survival benefit with adjuvant osimertinib (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) versus a placebo in EGFR-mutated stage IB-IIIA resected NSCLC. In this patient population, the decision to administer chemotherapy or not is much more challenging given the great benefit offered by osimertinib alone. Thus, it is time now to improve our communication tools to explain the role of adjuvant chemotherapy to our patients, especially in the EGFR-mutated population, in order to undertake real shared decision making in a clinical context in which the opportunity to administer toxic chemotherapy is debatable and subjective.",

Current first-line standard treatment for advanced disease is commonly considered third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), osimertinib. The study of primary and acquired resistance to front-line osimertinib is one of the main burning issues to further improve patients' outcome. Great heterogeneity has been depicted in terms of duration of clinical benefit and pattern of progression and this might be related to molecular factors including subtypes of EGFR mutations and concomitant genetic alterations. Acquired resistance can be categorized into two main classes: EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent mechanisms and specific pattern of progression to first-line osimertinib have been demonstrated. The purpose of the manuscript is to provide a comprehensive overview of literature about molecular resistance mechanisms to first-line osimertinib, from a clinical perspective and therefore in relationship to emerging therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for one-third of all cancer deaths worldwide. The MET (c-MET) gene, as one of the therapeutic target spots of NSCLC, has become increasingly more important. MET amplification/overexpression was divided into primary (intrinsic) and secondary (acquired). Studies indicated that the combination of Osimertinib and Savolitinib was safe and showed promising antitumor effect in NSCLC patients with secondary MET amplification after EGFR mutations. However, NSCLC patients with primary MET amplification/overexpression and EGFR mutations are rare in clinics, and the efficacy of dual-target therapy combined with EGFR-TKI and Savolitinib for them has not been studied yet. Here, we reported two NSCLC patients with primary MET amplification/overexpression and EGFR mutation, who benefited from T+S therapy (the dual-target therapy of EGFR-TKI plus Savolitinib) and achieved a progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 5 months. The two cases indicated that T+S therapy has an acceptable safety profile and encouraging antitumor efficacy in NSCLC patients harboring concurrent primary MET amplification/overexpression and EGFR mutation. Meanwhile, the observation stresses the importance of genetic testing, and the MET gene needs to be detected at first diagnosis for the best choice of targeted therapies.",

There is no consensus on the optimal sequence of local therapy (LT) and EGFR-TKIs for symptomatic BM patients because patients suffering neurological symptoms were not enrolled in most clinical trials. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutation (EGFRm) and symptomatic BM receiving first-line osimertinib and aumolertinib from two medical centers were collected. All participants were allocated into the third-generation EGFR-TKIs (TKIs) group and the upfront LT (uLT) plus third-generation EGFR-TKIs (TKIs\u2009+\u2009uLT) group. Demographic data, survival outcomes, treatment failure patterns, and adverse events were evaluated between the two groups. We also conducted subgroup analyses to explore the impact of BM number on survival outcomes. 86 patients were enrolled, 44 in the TKIs group and 42 in the TKIs\u2009+\u2009uLT group. There were no significant differences in the short-term response between the groups. TKIs\u2009+\u2009uLT was associated with significantly longer overall survival (OS) (43 vs. 28\u00a0months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.77; p\u2009=\u2009.011). No differences in progression-free survival (PFS), intracranial PFS (iPFS), failure patterns, or safety were observed.

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly lethal tumor that often develops resistance to targeted therapy. It is shown that Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylates AGO2 at S417 (pS417-AGO2), which promotes NSCLC progression by increasing the formation of microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). High levels of pS417-AGO2 in clinical NSCLC specimens are positively associated with poor prognosis. Interestingly, the treatment with EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib can significantly induce pS417-AGO2, thereby increasing the formation and activity of oncogenic miRISC, which may contribute to NSCLC resistance to Gefitinib. Based on these, two therapeutic strategies is developed. One is jointly to antagonize multiple oncogenic miRNAs highly expressed in NSCLC and use TBK1 inhibitor Amlexanox reducing the formation of oncogenic miRISC. Another approach is to combine Gefitinib with Amlexanox to inhibit the progression of Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. This findings reveal a novel mechanism of oncogenic miRISC regulation by TBK1-mediated pS417-AGO2 and suggest potential therapeutic approaches for NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of membrane proteins from extracellular vesicles (EVs) has emerged as an important strategy for molecular cancer diagnosis. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the most well-known oncogenic membrane proteins, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are often addressed based on EGFR mutation status. Consequently, several studies aimed at analyzing oncogenic membrane proteins have been proposed for cancer diagnosis. However, conventional protein analysis still faces limitations due to the requirement for large sample quantities and extensive post-labeling processes. Here, we develop a nanoplasmonic detection method for EGFR mutations in the diagnosis of NSCLC based on interactions between EGFR loaded in EVs and TKI. Gefitinib is selected as a model TKI due to its strong signals in the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and mutation-dependent binding affinity to EGFR. We demonstrate an SERS signal attributed to gefitinib at a higher value in the EGFR exon 19 deletion, both in cells and EVs, compared to wild-type and exon 19 deletion/T790M variants. Furthermore, we observe a significantly higher gefitinib SERS signal in EGFR obtained from exon 19 deletion NSCLC patient plasma-derived EVs compared with those from wild-type and exon 19 deletion/T790M EVs. Since our approach utilizes an analysis of the SERS signal generated by the interaction between oncogenic membrane proteins within EVs and targeted drugs, its diagnostic applicability could potentially extend to other liquid biopsy methods based on EVs.",

Despite the sustained clinical benefits achieved through optimal EGFR-TKI treatments, including the third-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib, resistance inevitably develops. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic options available postprogression on osimertinib. Here, we assessed the preclinical efficacy of BI-4732, a novel fourth-generation EGFR-TKI, using patient-derived preclinical models reflecting various clinical scenarios. The antitumor activity of BI-4732 was evaluated using Ba/F3 cells and patient-derived cell/organoid/xenograft models with diverse EGFR mutations. Intracranial antitumor activity of BI-4732 was evaluated in a brain-metastasis mouse model. We demonstrated the remarkable antitumor efficacy of BI-4732 as a single agent in various patient-derived models with EGFR_C797S-mediated osimertinib resistance. Moreover, BI-4732 exhibited activity comparable to osimertinib in inhibiting EGFR-activating (E19del and L858R) and T790M mutations. In a combination treatment strategy with osimertinib, BI-4732 exhibited a synergistic effect at significantly lower concentrations than those used in monotherapy. Importantly, BI-4732 displayed potent antitumor activity in an intracranial model, with low efflux at the blood-brain barrier. Our findings highlight the potential of BI-4732, a selective EGFR-TKI with high blood-brain barrier penetration, targeting a broad range of EGFR mutations, including C797S, warranting clinical development.",

The current preferred tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for the first-line treatment of EGFRm metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is osimertinib. However, the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and TKI has produced discordant results. We aimed to assess the effects of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination in EGFRm metastatic NSCLC. Using eligibility criteria focused on patients with EGFRm metastatic NSCLC treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib, we searched databases including clinical trial randomized studies and reviews published until April 15, 2023 in Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Embase. Eight clinical trials (1,052 patients) were selected from 1,343 articles for quantitative and qualitative assessment. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

The bevacizumab and erlotinib combination significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) (log(HR) = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.73,  The bevacizumab and erlotinib combination significantly improved PFS and ORR in EGFRm metastatic NSCLC but were also associated with higher-grade (\u22653) adverse events. These results suggest that while the combination therapy may enhance progression-free survival and overall response, it does not improve the overall survival and is associated with higher toxicity.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is recommended by major guidelines for use in the adjuvant setting in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC following the significant improvement in disease-free survival observed in the Phase III ADAURA trials. Due to limited real-world data in the adjuvant setting, little guidance exists on how to approach potential recurrences either during or after the completion of the treatment. This study aimed to reach a broad consensus on key treatment decision criteria in the events of recurrence. To reach a broad consensus, a modified Delphi panel study was conducted consisting of two rounds of surveys, followed by two consensus meetings and a final offline review of key statements. An international panel of experts in the field of NSCLC (n=12) was used to provide clinical insights regarding patient management at various stages of NSCLC disease including patient monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment approach for specific recurrence scenarios. This study tested recurrences occurring 1) within or outside the central nervous system (CNS), 2) during or after the adjuvant-osimertinib regimen in NSCLC disease which is 3) amenable or not amenable to local consolidative therapy. Panellists agreed on various aspects of patient monitoring and diagnostics including the use of standard techniques (e.g., CT, MRI) and tumour biomarker assessment using tissue and liquid biopsies. Consensus was reached on 6 statements describing treatment considerations for the specific NSCLC recurrence scenarios. Panellists agreed on the value of osimertinib as a monotherapy or as part of the overall treatment strategy within the probed recurrence scenarios and acknowledged that more clinical evidence is required before precise recommendations for specific patient populations can be made. This study provides a qualitative expert opinion framework for clinicians to consider within their treatment decision-making when faced with recurrence during or after adjuvant-osimertinib treatment.",

This is a retrospective study that involved 213 patients with EGFR-NSCLC and BMs, with the patients divided into two groups: the upfront cranial RT (ucRT) group (n = 96) and the non-ucRT group (n = 117). All patients were administered with osimertinib, and those in the ucRT group also underwent RT. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and intracranial PFS (IPFS) of the two groups were compared. The ucRT group manifested a markedly higher IPFS than the non-ucRT group (29.65 months vs 21.8 months; P < 0.0001). The subgroup analysis revealed that patients with oligometastases (OLOGO-BMs; 1-3 BMs) demonstrated a notably longer OS (44.5 months vs 37.3 months; P < 0.0001), PFS (32.3 months vs 20.8 months; P = 0.6884) and IPFS (37.8 months vs 22.1 months; P < 0.0001) in the ucRT group than in the non-ucRT group. However, for patients with multiple BMs, there was no significant difference in OS (27.3 months vs 34.4 months; P = 0.0710) and PFS (13.7 months vs 13.2 months; P = 0.0516) between the ucRT group and the non-ucRT group; the ucRT group exhibited a higher IPFS (26.4 months vs 21.35 months; P = 0.0028). Cox's multivariate analysis of patients with OLOGO-BM indicated that the use of ucRT was linked to a better OS (heart rate [HR] = 0.392; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.178-0.863; P = 0.020) and PFS (HR = 0.558; 95% CI: 0.316-0.986; P = 0.044). Upfront cerebral cranial stereotactic radiosurgery can improve outcomes in EGFR-positive patients with NSCLC and OLOGO-BM. However, for patients with multiple BMs, the preferable strategy may be pre-treatment with EGFR-TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Frequent failures observed in some trials comparing the efficacy and safety of osimertinib plus bevacizumab to osimertinib monotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations have brought questions. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of these two treatment regimens in advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases were extensively searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 14 May 2023. Two researchers independently screened the literature, assessed quality, and extracted data. The primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). The secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs) and PFS stratified by patients' characteristics. STATA 17.0 software (StataCorp LLC, USA) was adopted for meta-analysis. A total of four RCTs involving 390 patients were included. Overall, the risk of bias across the studies was moderate to low. Pooled results showed that compared to osimertinib alone, the addition of bevacizumab to osimertinib failed to show prolongation of PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-1.27], OS (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.73-1.41), or improvement of the ORR (risk ratio = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.90-1.38), while an increased incidence of some AEs was observed, such as nausea, oral mucositis, hypertension, and proteinuria. Notably, combination treatment did significantly prolong the PFS in the subset of smokers (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.94). A mild trend toward PFS benefit under the combined regimen was also noted in patients with brain metastases and first-line treatment, though not reaching statistical significance. Based on the available evidence, the addition of bevacizumab to osimertinib could not provide additional survival benefits with higher but manageable toxicity for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Osimertinib monotherapy remains the prioritized treatment. Further investigation is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The role of neoadjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted therapy for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. Previous studies have shown that EGFR-TKIs have excellent anti-tumor activity. However, almost all studies on neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC have been non-randomized controlled trials with small sample sizes and different methods of statistical analysis, which may lead to a lack of valid metrics to assess the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI treatment. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI treatment for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. Relevant studies were systematically searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Results including objective response rate (ORR), complete resection rate (R0), downstaging rate, pathological complete response (PCR), major pathological response (MPR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) were used for further analysis. This meta-analysis ultimately included 11 studies involving 344 patients with EGFR-positive mutations in NSCLC. In terms of tumor response, the pooled ORR was 57% (95% CI: 42%-73%), and in the Osimertinib subgroup, the pooled ORR was 80% (95% CI: 63%-98%). Analysis of studies that reported a downstaging rate showed the pooled downstaging rate of 41% (95% CI: 9%-74%) and the pooled downstaging rate of 74% (95% CI: 22%-100%) in the Osimertinib subgroup. In terms of surgical outcomes, the pooled pCR rate was 3% (95% CI: 0%-7%), the pooled MPR rate was 11% (95% CI: 6%-17%), and the pooled R0 resection rate was 91% (95% CI: 85%-95%). The most common adverse events associated with neoadjuvant therapy were rash and diarrhea. The pooled incidence of any grade of rash was 47.1% (95% CI: 25.4%-69.3%), and the pooled incidence of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 rash was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.0%-2.5%). The pooled incidence of diarrhea of any grade was 28.8% (95% CI: 14.4%-45.4%), with the pooled incidence of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 diarrhea of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0%-1.6%). The pooled incidence of\u2009\u2265\u2009grade 3 adverse events was significantly lower. Our meta-analysis confirmed the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant EGFR-TKIs for the treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR-positive mutations and that third-generation EGFR-TKIs were superior to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs in terms of shrinking tumor volume and lowering tumor stage; however, future large-scale and multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this conclusion.

The patient had 6 months of remission before progression, after which bevacizumab was added again. To date, the disease has been under control. The brain lesion showed partial response again, and the side effects of bevacizumab were tolerable. The overall survival time exceeded 4 years.

This has increased the number of patients who seek treatment in the third line and beyond setting. We conducted this study to compare the quality of life (QoL), toxicity, and outcomes in patients receiving chemotherapy and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in this setting. In this phase 3, randomized, open-label study, patients with stage III or IV NSCLC with disease progression on at least two prior lines of chemotherapy, with a life expectancy of at least 3 months, without prior EGFR TKI exposure, and stable brain metastases (if any) were included. Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy (gemcitabine or docetaxel or paclitaxel or vinorelbine) or an EGFR TKI (erlotinib or gefitinib).

Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on pretreatment tumor tissue with matched normal samples from NSCLC patients with (n\u2009=\u200925, detected in tissue or blood rebiopsies) or without (n\u2009=\u200914, negative tissue rebiopsies only) subsequent EGFR p.T790M mutation after treatment with 1G/2G EGFR TKI. Several complex genetic biomarkers were assessed using bioinformatic methods. After treatment with first-line afatinib (44%) or erlotinib/gefitinib (56%), median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.1 and 33.7\u2009months, respectively. Clinical and tumor genetic characteristics, including age (median, 66\u2009years), sex (74% female), smoking (69% never/light smokers), EGFR mutation type (72% exon 19 deletions), and TP53 mutations (41%) were not significantly associated with T790M mutation (p\u2009>\u20090.05). By contrast, complex biomarkers including tumor mutational burden, the clock-like mutation signature SBS1\u2009+\u20095, tumor ploidy, and markers of subclonality including mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity, subclonal copy number changes, and median tumor-adjusted variant allele frequency were significantly higher at baseline in tumors with subsequent T790M mutation (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Each marker alone could predict subsequent development of T790M with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72-0.77, but the small number of cases did not allow confirmation of better performance for biomarker combinations in leave-one-out cross-validated logistic regression (AUC 0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.87). Extended molecular profiling with WES at initial diagnosis reveals several complex biomarkers associated with subsequent development of T790M resistance mutation in NSCLC patients receiving first-/second-generation TKIs as the first-line therapy. Larger prospective studies will be necessary to define a forecasting model.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib resistance is an urgent problem to be solved in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) is one of the main active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which exhibits significant antitumor effects. The aim of this study is to explore the reversal effect of Tan IIA on gefitinib resistance in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC and the underlying mechanism. CCK-8, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry were applied to detect the cytotoxicity, proliferation, and apoptosis, respectively. The changes in lipid profiles were measured by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Western blot, real-time q-PCR, and immunohistochemical were used to detect the protein and the corresponding mRNA levels. The in vivo antitumor effect was validated by the xenograft mouse model. Co-treatment of Tan IIA enhanced the sensitivity of resistant NSCLC cells to gefitinib. Mechanistically, Tan IIA could downregulate the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its downstream target genes, causing changes in lipid profiles, thereby reversing the gefitinib-resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Tan IIA improved gefitinib sensitivity via SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis. Tan IIA could be a potential candidate to enhance sensitivity for gefitinib-resistant NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a first-line or adjuvant therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. However, owing to the adverse events associated with treatment, certain patients cannot maintain a daily regimen of 80 or 40\u2009mg. In this study, we examined the efficacy of 40\u2009mg of osimertinib administered every other day. In this single-center, retrospective study, we evaluated patients with NSCLC harboring an EGFR mutation in whom treatment was initiated with 40\u2009mg osimertinib every other day at our institution between May 2016 and June 2023. The major outcome was the duration of administering 40\u2009mg osimertinib every other day. Six patients with NSCLC were evaluated. The median duration of 40\u2009mg osimertinib intake every other day was 12.6\u2009months. Four of the six patients weighed below 50\u2009kg, and four experienced weight loss. Additionally, four of the six patients had severe renal impairment upon receiving 40\u2009mg osimertinib every other day. Thus, our findings suggest the efficacy of administering 40\u2009mg osimertinib every other day in patients with low bodyweight, weight loss, or severe renal impairment.",

    "abstract": "Durvalumab improves survival when used as consolidation therapy after chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with stage III NSCLC. The optimal consolidation therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant (EGFRmut) stage III NSCLC remains unknown. In this multi-institutional, international retrospective analysis across 24 institutions, we evaluated outcomes in patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT followed by consolidation therapy with osimertinib, durvalumab, or observation between 2015 and 2022. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS, primary end point) and overall survival (secondary end point). Treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) during consolidation treatment were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used. Of 136 patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with definitive concurrent CRT, 56 received consolidation durvalumab, 33 received consolidation osimertinib, and 47 was on observation alone. Baseline characteristics were similar across the three cohorts. With a median follow-up of 46 months for the entire cohort, the median duration of treatment was not reached (NR) for osimertinib (interquartile range: NR-NR) and was 5.5 (interquartile range: 2.4-10.8) months with durvalumab. After adjusting for nodal status, stage III A/B/C, and age, patients treated with consolidation osimertinib had significantly longer 24-month rwPFS compared to those treated with durvalumab or in the observation cohorts (osimertinib: 86%, durvalumab: 30%, observation: 27%, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). There was no difference in rwPFS between the durvalumab and the observation cohorts. No significant difference in overall survival across the three cohorts was detected, likely due to the limited follow-up. Any-grade trAE occurred in 52% (2 [6.1%] grade \u22653) and 48% (10 [18%] grade \u22653) of patients treated with osimertinib and durvalumab, respectively. Of 45 patients who progressed on consolidation durvalumab, 37 (82%) subsequently received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of these, 14 (38%) patients developed trAEs including five patients with pneumonitis (14%; 2 [5.4%] grade \u22653) and five patients with diarrhea (14%; 1 [2.7%] grade \u22653). This study suggests that among patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, consolidation osimertinib was associated with a significantly longer rwPFS compared to durvalumab or observation. No unanticipated safety signals were observed with consolidation osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "MET pathway activation is one of the most common mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We previously demonstrated spatial and temporal heterogeneity in MET pathway activation upon osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC; however, the functional relevance of these findings is unclear. Here, we generated 19 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from 9 patients with multi-region and temporal sampling of osimertinib-resistant tumor tissue from patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. MET pathway activation was a putative mechanism of osimertinib resistance in 66% (n = 6/9) patients from whom PDXs were generated. Significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in MET pathway activation was evident. Osimertinib-resistant PDXs with MET amplification by FISH (defined as MET/CEP7 ratio \u22652.0 or mean MET \u2265 6.0 copies/cell) and high-level phospho-MET, but not c-MET expression, had better responses to osimertinib and savolitinib combination than to osimertinib alone. MET polysomy tumors by FISH from both PDXs and patients had evidence of subclonal phospho-MET expression. Select MET polysomy PDX tumors with phospho-MET expression responded better to osimertinib and savolitinib combination than MET polysomy PDX tumors without phospho-MET expression. Our results suggest osimertinib and savolitinib combination is most effective for osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant tumors with MET pathway activation as evidenced by phospho-MET. As subclonal MET amplification may be evident in MET polysomy tumor progression, MET polysomy warrants close clinical follow-up with phospho-MET IHC in parallel with FISH diagnostic. Using a novel cohort of in vivo PDX models of MET pathway activation with acquired resistance to osimertinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we demonstrate that phospho-MET may be a clinically relevant assay to guide treatment selection with osimertinib and savolitinib combination. In addition, our work shows that patients with MET polysomy tumors may have subclonal MET amplification and therefore require close follow up for the use of osimertinib and savolitinib combination.",

In this case report, the patient was treated with alternating months of osimertinib and olaparib to control her lung and ovarian cancers, respectively. When both diseases showed progression, the patient underwent a trial of concurrent therapy with both drugs, yet this was discontinued due to patient-reported adverse side effects. Combination targeted drug therapy may be required to treat complex diagnoses such as dual malignancies. However, combination drug therapy consisting of osimertinib and olaparib has not previously been explored. This case report represents the first to demonstrate osimertinib and olaparib combination therapy as a unique treatment regimen for concurrent lung and ovarian cancers. These two drugs can either be given in an alternating way or given together, short-term, with a higher but tolerable toxicity profile.",

    "abstract": "The long non-coding RNA HOTAIR and the Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling pathway are closely associated with tumor occurrence and drug resistance in various cancers. However, their specific roles in the development of EGFR-TKIs resistance in non-small cell carcinoma remain unclear. To address the issue of EGFR-TKIs resistance, this study utilized the electrospray method to prepare sodium alginate microspheres encapsulating HOTAIR siRNA (SA/HOTAIR siRNA) and investigated its effects on RNA interference (RNAi) in the gefitinib-resistant cell line PC9/GR. Furthermore, the study explored whether HOTAIR could modulate EGFR-TKIs resistance through the Hedgehog-GLi1 signaling pathway. The experimental results showed that sodium alginate (SA) microspheres demonstrated excellent biocompatibility with high encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading capacity, effectively enhancing the silencing efficiency of siRNA. HOTAIR siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of PC9/GR cells while promoting apoptosis. Additionally, HOTAIR siRNA effectively suppressed tumor growth and downregulated the Hedgehog-GLi1 pathway and anti-apoptotic proteins, which were confirmed in animal experiments. Moreover, SA/HOTAIR siRNA exhibited superior inhibition of cellular and tumor functions compared to using HOTAIR siRNA alone. Clinical research findings indicated that monitoring the expression level of HOTAIR in the serum and urine samples of NSCLC patients before and after receiving EGFR-TKIs treatment can predict the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs to a certain extent. This study provided evidence that HOTAIR siRNA effectively mitigated the development of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs by inhibiting the Hedgehog-GLi1 pathway. Furthermore, it introduced a reliable and long-lasting drug delivery system for combating acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Although somatic mutations were explored in depth, limited biomarkers were found to predict the resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). Previous studies reported N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels regulated response of EGFR-TKIs; whether the germline variants located in m6A sites affected resistance of EGFR-TKIs is still unknown. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutation were enrolled to investigate predictors for response of EGFR-TKIs using a genome-wide-variant-m6A analysis. Bioinformatics analysis and series of molecular biology assays were used to uncover the underlying mechanism. We identified the germline mutation USP36 rs3744797 (C > A, K814N) was associated with survival of patients with NSCLC treated with gefitinib [median progression-free survival (PFS): CC vs. CA, 16.30 vs. 10.50 months, P < 0.0001, HR = 2.45] and erlotinib (median PFS: CC vs. CA, 14.13 vs. 9.47 months, P = 0.041, HR = 2.63). Functionally, the C > A change significantly upregulated USP36 expression by reducing its m6A level. Meanwhile, rs3744797_A (USP36 MUT) was found to facilitate proliferation, migration, and resistance to EGFR-TKIs via upregulating MLLT3 expression in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, MLLT3 and USP36 levels are tightly correlated in patients with NSCLC, which were associated with prognosis of patients. Mechanistically, USP36 MUT stabilized MLLT3 by deubiquitinating MLLT3 in nucleoli and consequently activating its downstream signaling (HIF1\u03b1 and Snai). Furthermore, inhibition of MLLT3 alleviated USP36 variant-induced EGFR-TKIs resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. These findings characterized rs3744797 as an oncogenic variant in mediating EGFR-TKI resistance and tumor aggressiveness through deubiquitinating MLLT3, highlighting the variant as a predictive biomarker for EGFR-TKI response in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Rechallenge therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is known to confer some clinical benefit for patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the efficacy of EGFR-TKI rechallenge after resistance to first-line (1L) osimertinib. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI rechallenge therapy after resistance to 1L osimertinib in a Japanese clinical setting. Between April 2018 and August 2022, 26 patients who progressed after treatment with 1L osimertinib and received EGFR-TKI rechallenge were included in this multicenter retrospective analysis. Patients in whom 1L osimertinib was discontinued owing to toxicity and had subsequent disease progression were also included in the analysis. Overall, the objective response rate for rechallenge therapy was 23.1%. The disease control rate was 53.9%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.4 months. Patients who discontinued 1L osimertinib for toxicity had a higher response rate (42.9% vs. 15.8%) and longer PFS than those who discontinued it due to disease progression (median: 11.4 vs. 2.7 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Three patients (11.5%) developed rechallenge therapy-associated pneumonitis, two of which were grade \u22653. Rechallenge with EGFR-TKI after 1L osimertinib resistance showed limited clinical efficacy. However, it could be considered as a subsequent salvage therapeutic option for patients in whom 1L osimertinib was discontinued owing to toxicity.",

    "abstract": "To introduce a drug to the market, it's not mandatory for it to be more effective and safer than the current treatment for the same condition. Consequently, head-to-head studies between the two best treatments for the same condition are not required, and this could result in a lack of information for patients, clinicians, and decision-makers. This study aims to evaluate the presence of head-to-head studies among the drugs used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Taking into account the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines updated to 2022, which list all available treatments for each NSCLC subtype, the search engine Pubmed and the platform clinicaltrials.gov were consulted to find all completed and ongoing head-to-head studies among various treatments for NSCLC. Among the anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) drugs, 7 studies were found, with 6 completed and 5 registrational for drug commercialisation. No completed study to date has compared osimertinib and afatinib. For anti-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) drugs, 7 studies were found, with 5 completed. Alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib have no completed comparison studies, but all were compared with crizotinib. Among various immunotherapy-based regimens, 5 studies were found, with only 1 completed. Therapeutic regimens based on pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab have not been compared in studies published to date. There are few head-to-head studies comparing treatments for NSCLC; there are no such studies between the latest generation of drugs. Consequently, ambiguous areas exist due to the lack of comparative studies among the available evidence, preventing the clinician's choice of the most effective treatment and risking the patient receiving suboptimal therapy. Simultaneously, the price of the drug cannot be determined correctly, relying only on indirect evaluations from different trials. To dispel this uncertainty, it would be desirable to initiate a process that brings together the demands derived from clinical practice and clinical research to provide clinicians and patients with the best possible evidence.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the third-generation, pyrimidine-based, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that received approval from the FDA in November 2015 and has become the standard approach in patients with advanced, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially with brain metastases. Osimertinib is beneficial in terms of progression-free and overall survival in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However, the rarity of bilateral pneumothorax among adverse events necessitates further research on its potential fatality rate. A 72-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV (T2NxM1) NSCLC with the 21L858R mutation of the EGFR gene received osimertinib treatment. Unfortunately, 10 weeks after osimertinib treatment, the patient developed severe interstitial lung disease and pneumothorax. Thus, osimertinib treatment was discontinued, and prednisolone (160\u2009mg/day) and supportive treatment were administered. Osimertinib-induced severe interstitial lung disease and pneumothorax. Osimertinib treatment was discontinued, and prednisolone (160\u2009mg/day) and supportive treatment were administered. The bilateral pneumothorax was difficult to correct and the patient eventually died. Osimertinib-induced pneumothorax occurred approximately 10 weeks after receiving the drug and had severe cough and chest tightness as initial symptoms. In addition, the incidence of drug-induced pneumothorax increases in patients treated with osimertinib when combined with underlying respiratory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a promising and approved third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a standard strategy for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, developed resistance is unavoidable, which reduces its long-term effectiveness. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The PrognoScan database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were used to identify the key genes for clinical prognosis and gene correlation respectively. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. Cell viability assay and Ki67 staining were used to evaluate the effect of osimertinib on tumor cells. Finally, we screened out two hub genes, myelocytomatosis oncogene (Myc) and axis inhibition protein 1 (Axin1), upregulated in three osimertinib-resistant cell lines through RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Next, cell experiment confirmed that expression of C-MYC and AXIN1 were elevated in different EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to osimertinib, compared with their corresponding parental cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AXIN1 upregulated the expression of C-MYC and mediated the acquired resistance of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to osimertinib in vitro. In conclusion, AXIN1 affected the sensitivity of EGFR mutant NSCLC to osimertinib via regulating C-MYC expression in vitro. Targeting AXIN1/MYC signaling may be a potential new strategy for overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib.",

    "title": "Xie-Bai-San increases NSCLC cells sensitivity to gefitinib by inhibiting Beclin-1 mediated autophagosome formation.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy, a cellular process involving lysosomal self-digestion, plays a crucial role in recycling biomolecules and degrading dysfunctional proteins and damaged organelles. However, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cancer cells can exploit autophagy to survive metabolic stress and develop resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), which reduce treatment efficacies. Currently, most studies have found that late-stage autophagy inhibitors can hinder EGFR-TKIs resistance, while research on early-stage autophagy inhibitors is still limited. This study investigates the mechanism via which the Xie-Bai-San (XBS) formula enhances NSCLC cell sensitivity to gefitinib, revealing the relationship between XBS-induced cell death and the inhibition of autophagosome formation. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 and EdU assays, lentivirus transfection was utilized to generate PC9 cells harboring the PIK3CA E545K mutation (referred to as PC9-M), autophagic flux was monitored using mCherry-GFP-LC3 adenovirus. Protein expression and colocalization were observed through immunofluorescence staining. The interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 in PC9-GR and PC9-M cells was determined via co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and PI staining, and overall survival analysis of lung adenocarcinoma patients was conducted using the TCGA database. In vivo experiments included a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model with EGFR and PIK3CA mutations and subcutaneous mice xenografts of NSCLC cell lines (PC9 and PC9-GR). In addition, autophagic vesicles in mouse tumor tissues were observed via transmission electron microscopy analysis. XBS effectively inhibits the proliferation of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells and induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, XBS suppresses gefitinib-induced autophagic flux by inhibiting autophagy through the upregulation of p-mTOR and Bcl-2 and downregulation of Beclin-1. Additionally, XBS enhances the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, and the overexpression of Beclin-1 promotes NSCLC cell proliferation and counteracts XBS-induced cell death, while XBS demonstrates minimal impact on autophagosome-lysosome fusion or lysosome function. This study reveals a novel role for the XBS formula in impeding autophagy initiation and demonstrates its potential as a candidate drug to counteract autophagy-induced treatment resistance in NSCLC.",

However, the efficacy of osimertinib for malignant pleural effusion (MPE) remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of osimertinib on time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) in patients with EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC, comparing those with and without MPE. This retrospective analysis included patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with osimertinib at our hospital between April 2016 and June 2021. TTF was defined as the duration from osimertinib initiation to discontinuation, and OS as the duration until death, irrespective of the reason. Among 229 patients receiving osimertinib, 84 had MPE before administration, 39 acquired EGFR exon20 T790M mutation following previous EGFR-TKI therapy, and 45 were EGFR-TKI-naive. Among EGFR-TKI-naive patients, median TTF was 14.8 and 19.8\u2009months for those with and without MPE, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-2.18; p\u2009=\u20090.12).

    "abstract": "Both first and second-generation EGFR-TKIs are recommended in advanced NSCLC with common EGFR mutations. However, there are few data on the difference in efficacy of EGFR-TKIs based on the type of EGFR mutation and agents. This retrospective real-world study evaluated the outcomes and clinicopathologic characteristics, including the type of EGFR mutations, of 237 advanced NSCLC patients treated with first- or second-generation (afatinib) EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients were 11 months (M) and 25M, respectively. In the univariate analysis, patients with exon 19 deletion (del) (n=130) had significantly longer median OS compared to those with other mutations (L858R: 84, others: 23) (30 vs. 22 M, p=0.047), without a difference in PFS (p=0.138). Patients treated with afatinib (n=60) showed significantly longer median OS compared to those treated with first-generation TKIs (gefitinib: 159, erlotinib: 18) (30 vs. 23 M, p=0.037), without a difference in PFS (p=0.179). In patients with exon 19 del, there was no significant difference in median PFS (p=0.868) or OS (p=0.361) between patients treated with afatinib and those treated with first-generation TKIs, while significantly better PFS (p=0.042) and trend in OS (p=0.069) were observed in patients receiving afatinib in other mutations. Exon 19 del was independently associated with favorable OS (p=0.028), while age >70 years (p=0.017), ECOG performance status \u22652 (p=0.001), primary metastatic disease (p=0.007), and synchronous brain metastasis (p=0.026) were independent prognostic factors of poor OS. The EGFR exon 19 del was associated with favorable OS in advanced NSCLC patients receiving first-line EGFR-TKIs. Moreover, in patients with exon 19 del, first-generation TKIs seem to be a reasonable treatment option if osimertinib is unavailable.",

    "abstract": "MET and AXL dysregulations are implicated in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. But consensus on the optimal definition for MET/AXL dysregulations in EGFR-mutant NSCLC is lacking. Here, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of ningetinib (a MET/AXL inhibitor) plus gefitinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and evaluated the clinical relevance of MET/AXL dysregulations by different definitions. Patients in this phase 1b dose-escalation/dose-expansion trial received ningetinib 30\u00a0mg/40\u00a0mg/60\u00a0mg plus gefitinib 250\u00a0mg once daily. Primary endpoints were tolerability (dose-escalation) and objective response rate (dose-expansion). MET/AXL status were analyzed using FISH and IHC. Between March 2017 and January 2021, 108 patients were enrolled. The proportion of MET focal amplification, MET polysomy, MET overexpression, AXL amplification and AXL overexpression is 18.1\u00a0%, 5.6\u00a0%, 55.8\u00a0%, 8.1\u00a0% and 45.3\u00a0%, respectively. 6.8\u00a0% patients have concurrent MET amplification and AXL overexpression. ORR is 30.8\u00a0% for tumors with MET amplification, 0\u00a0% for MET polysomy, 24.1\u00a0% for MET overexpression, 20\u00a0% for AXL amplification and 27.6\u00a0% for AXL overexpression. For patients with concurrent MET amplification and AXL overexpression, ningetinib plus gefitinib provides an ORR of 80\u00a0%, DCR of 100\u00a0% and median PFS of 4.7\u00a0months. Tumors with higher MET copy number and AXL expression tend to have higher likelihood of response. Biomarker analyses show that MET focal amplification and overexpression are complementary in predicting clinical benefit from MET inhibition, while AXL dysregulations defined by an arbitrary level may dilute the efficacy of AXL blockade.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinically approved for first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although an impressive drug response is initially observed, in most of tumors, resistance occurs after different time and an alternative therapeutic strategy to induce regression disease is currently lacking. The hyperactivation of MEK/MAPKs, is one the most common event identified in osimertinib-resistant (OR) NSCLC cells. However, in response to selective drug pressure, the occurrence of multiple mechanisms of resistance may contribute to treatment failure. In particular, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the impaired DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways are recognized as additional cause of resistance in NSCLC thus promoting tumor progression. Here we showed that concurrent upregulation of ITGB1 and DDR family proteins may be associated with an increase of EMT pathways and linked to both osimertinib and MEK inhibitor resistance to cell death. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the existence of an interplay between ITGB1 and DDR and highlighted, for the first time, that combined treatment of MEK inhibitor with DDRi may be relevant to downregulate ITGB1 levels and increase cell death in OR NSCLC cells.",

    "abstract": "In this observational study, we analyzed the time on treatment (ToT) and overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in a 2.7-million-member public health provider in Israel. Newly diagnosed patients with mNSCLC who initiated first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy between Jan 2017-Dec 2020 were identified from the National Cancer Registry and Maccabi Healthcare Services database. Outcomes were assessed at a minimum of 23 months of follow-up (cutoff: 30th November 2022). All analyses compared first-line treatment osimertinib vs. standard TKIs (erlotinib, afatanib or gefitinib). A total of 165 patients (59% female, median age 68 years) were identified, including 58% smokers, 95% with adenocarcinomas, 33% with brain metastases, and 62%/15%/23% with 0-1/2-4/unknown performance status (PS). Of these, 77 (47%) were treated with standard TKI drugs and 88 (53%) with osimertinib as first-line treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 33.6 months (95%CI=29.9-37.3) and 58.5 months (95%CI=52.5-64.4) for patients who received osimertinib and standard TKIs, respectively. The median ToT (in months) was significantly (p<0.0001) longer with osimertinib (17.6; 95%CI=13.71-23.9) vs. standard TKIs (9.40; 95%CI=7.17-12.1). The 24-month survival rate was 58.0% among patients who received osimertinib and 50.6% among those who received standard TKI therapy (p=0.18). From second-line treatment initiation, 43.8% of those who received second-line osimertinib and 17.7% of those that received other second-line treatment were still alive at 24 months. Compared to standard TKIs, first-line osimertinib treatment was associated with a significantly longer ToT, and a longer OS. Our cohort also included patients with PS 2-4 who would not necessarily be included in clinical trials, allowing analysis of a real-world population.",

    "title": "Rapid Advances in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "A series of high-profile clinical trials for patients with resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have recently changed the standard of care in this setting. Specifically, studies have demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvements in efficacy with the targeted therapy for adjuvant osimertinib in patients with resected NSCLC harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genomic abnormality (GA), whereas trials with chemotherapy combined with nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting and others testing atezolizumab or pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy have all demonstrated improvements in event-free survival (EFS) (for neoadjuvant therapy) or disease-free survival (DFS) (for adjuvant therapy). These trials introduce many open questions about how to apply these findings in clinical practice. Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib for 3 years was associated with significant improvement in both DFS and overall survival (OS), but the erosion of the DFS benefit after the duration of treatment ends suggests a potential value for more longitudinal treatment. The potential value of highly effective targeted therapies as adjuvant therapy for other GAs has a compelling rationale but no data at this time. Adjuvant atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, generally administered for 1 year after postoperative chemotherapy, are appropriate considerations, but only atezolizumab for patients with tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) levels of 50% has demonstrated a benefit in OS. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nivolumab offers a strong EFS benefit, a shorter interval of treatment, and radiographic and pathologic feedback for patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, although very recent randomized clinical trials of perioperative immunotherapy both combined with chemotherapy preoperatively and administered postoperatively highlight the debatable value of adjuvant immunotherapy after prior chemoimmunotherapy. Improved tumor shrinkage rates with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy suggest the possibility that criteria for resectability may potentially be redefined in anticipation of a good response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Developments in resectable NSCLC have arrived so rapidly that they have also created practical challenges of identifying optimal patients and prioritizing options among these new competing standards. In some cases, practical management requires clinical judgment and discussion with the patient to cover the gaps in prospective data. Caution should be exerted when extrapolating beyond the available data.",

    "abstract": "The ADAURA trial demonstrated the superiority of osimertinib over a placebo with regard to disease-free survival, showing it to be indicated as an adjuvant therapy for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The aim of the present study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis and an analysis of the budgetary impact of adjuvant therapy with osimertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with mutated EGFR who had undergone resection surgery with curative intent. Analyses were based on the outcomes of the ADAURA clinical trial and were conducted through a Spanish National Health Service perspective. The outcome measures used were quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The average overall cost of adjuvant treatment with osimertinib over a period of 100 months in the overall sample of trial patients (stages IB-IIIA) was 220,961 \u20ac, compared with 197,849 \u20ac in the placebo group. Effectiveness, estimated according to QALY, was 6.26 years in the osimertinib group and 5.96 years in the placebo group, with the incremental cost-utility ratio being 77,040 \u20ac/QALY. With regard to the budgetary impact, it was estimated that, in 2021, approximately 1130 patients would be subsidiaries to receive osimertinib. This pertains to a difference of 17,375,330 \u20ac over 100 months to fund this treatment relative to no treatment. Taking into account a Spanish threshold of 24,000 \u20ac/QALY, the reduction in the acquisition cost of osimertinib will have to be greater than 10%, to obtain a cost-effective alternative.",

    "abstract": "Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC have a high incidence of brain metastases. The EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib has intracranial activity, making the role of local central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapies, such as radiation and surgery, less clear. Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and brain metastases who received osimertinib as initial therapy after brain metastasis diagnosis were included. Individual lesion responses were assessed using adapted RANO-BM criteria. CNS progression and local progression of brain metastasis from osimertinib start were analyzed using cumulative incidence treating death as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. There were 36 patients who had a median interval from brain metastasis diagnosis to first-line osimertinib initiation of 25 days. In total, 136 previously untreated brain metastases were tracked from baseline. Overall, 105 lesions (77.2%) had complete response and 31 had partial response reflecting best objective response of 100%. Best response occurred at a median of 96 days (range: 28-1113 d) from baseline magnetic resonance imaging. This reflects a best objective response rate of 100%. Two-year overall survival was 80%. CNS progression rates at 1-, 2-, and 3-years post-osimertinib were 21%, 32%, and 41%, respectively. Lesion-level local failure was estimated to be 0.7% and 4.7% at 1- and 2-years post-osimertinib, respectively. No clinicodemographic factors including brain metastasis number were associated with post-osimertinib progression. Intracranial response to osimertinib is excellent for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with de novo, previously untreated brain metastases. Very low local failure rates support a strategy of upfront osimertinib alone in selected patients.",

However, the majority of patients treated with Osi eventually relapse within a year. The mechanisms of Osi resistance remain largely unexplored, and efficient strategies to reverse the resistance are urgently needed. Here, we developed a lactoferrin-modified liposomal codelivery system for the combination therapy of Osi and panobinostat (Pan), an epigenetic regulator of histone acetylation. We demonstrated that the codelivery liposomes could efficiently repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) from the M2 to M1 phenotype and reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated drug resistance in the tumor cells, as well as suppress glycolysis, lactic acid production, and angiogenesis. Our results suggested that the combination therapy of Osi and Pan mediated by liposomal codelivery is a promising strategy for overcoming Osi resistance in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP2) is a non-receptor protein phosphatase that transduces signals from upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)/non-RTKs to Ras/MAPK pathway. Accumulating studies indicated that SHP2 is a critical mediator of resistance to current targeted therapies in multiple cancers. Here, we reported a novel SHP2 allosteric inhibitor JC-010a, which was highly selective to SHP2 and bound at the \"tunnel\" allosteric site of SHP2. The effect of JC-010a on combating RTK/non-RTK or MAPK inhibitors-induced acquired resistance was explored. Our study demonstrated that JC-010a monotherapy significantly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells with different oncogenic drivers via inhibiting signaling through SHP2. Importantly, JC-010a abolished acquired resistance induced by targeted therapies: in KRAS-mutant cancers, JC-010a abrogated selumetinib-induced adaptive resistance mediated by RTK/SHP2; in BCR-ABL-driven leukemia cells, we demonstrated JC-010a inhibited BCR-ABL T315I mutation-mediated imatinib resistance and proposed a novel mechanism of JC-010a involving the disrupted co-interaction of SHP2, BCR-ABL, and Hsp90; in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, JC-010a inhibited both EGFR T790M/C797S mutation and alternate RTK-driven resistance to gefitinib or osimertinib; importantly, we first proposed a novel potential therapeutic strategy for RET-rearranged cancer, we confirmed that JC-010a monotherapy inhibited cell resistance to BLU-667, and JC-010a/BLU-667 combination prolonged anticancer response both in vivo and in vitro cancer models by inhibiting the alternate MET activation-induced RAS/MAPK reactivation, thereby promoting cancer cell apoptosis. These findings suggested that JC-010a was a novel selective SHP2 allosteric inhibitor, and combing JC-010a with current targeted therapy agents provided a promising therapeutic approach for clinical resistant cancers.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Gefitinib is a first-line treatment for NSCLC. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the development of drug resistance. At present, Shenqi Fuzheng injection (SFI) is widely accepted as an adjuvant therapy in NSCLC. This study investigates the molecular mechanism of SFI when combined with gefitinib in regulating cell progression among EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC. We established gefitinib-resistant PC9-GR cells by exposing gefitinib escalation from 10\u2009nM with the indicated concentrations of SFI in PC9 cells (1, 4, and 8\u2009mg/mL). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess gene expression. PC9/GR and H1975 cells were treated with 50\u2009ng/mL of interleukin (IL)-22 alone or in combination with 10\u2009mg/mL of SFI. STAT3, p-STAT3, AKT, and p-AKT expression were evaluated using Western blot. The effects on cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and apoptosis in NSCLC cells were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation and flow cytometry assays. SFI treatment alleviated the development of gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. PC9/GR and H1975 cells treated with SFI significantly exhibited a reduction in IL-22 protein and mRNA overexpression levels. SFI effectively counteracted the activation of the STAT3/AKT signaling pathway induced by adding exogenous IL-22 to PC9/GR and H1975 cells. Moreover, IL-22 combined with gefitinib markedly increased cell viability while reducing apoptosis. In contrast, combining SFI with gefitinib and the concurrent treatment of SFI with gefitinib and IL-22 demonstrated the opposite effect. SFI can be a valuable therapeutic option to address gefitinib resistance in NSCLC by suppressing the IL-22/STAT3/AKT pathway.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib resistance is regarded as a major obstacle limiting survival bene\ufb01ts for patients undergoing treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying mechanisms of acquired resistance remain unclear. In this study, we report that estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) is highly expressed in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC and plays a pivotal role in promoting osimertinib resistance. We further identified ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) as a critical binding partner that deubiquitinates and upregulates ER\u03b2 in NSCLC. ER\u03b2 promotes osimertinib resistance by mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We found that ER\u03b2 mechanistically suppresses peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) SUMOylation and thus confers osimertinib resistance onto NSCLC. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that depletion of ER\u03b2 induces ROS accumulation and reverses osimertinib resistance in NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that USP7-mediated ER\u03b2 stabilization suppresses PRDX3 SUMOylation to mitigate ROS accumulation and promote osimertinib resistance, suggesting that targeting ER\u03b2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome osimertinib resistance in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) should always be considered when treating advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with atypical EGFR mutations. The first choice of TKI depends on the specific mutation(s) present and its effect on structure and function of the EGFR protein. Afatinib is the only EGFR TKI currently FDA approved for atypical EGFR mutations and has the strongest data to support its use in PACC mutations, a subgroup of atypical EGFR mutations which includes G719X and S7681. Dacomitinib may also be an option for these mutations given similar efficacy to afatinib. In contrast, for classical-like mutations such as L861Q, osimertinib should be considered the first choice given that their behavior mimics that of the classical mutations exon 19 deletion and L858R. Osimertinib should also be utilized in the setting of a concurrent T790M mutation. Superior CNS penetrance and well managed toxicity profile may also be reasons to consider osimertinib. Given that the choice of TKI may depend on the specific mutation, it is crucial that every patient diagnosed with NSCLC undergo comprehensive sequencing to identify these mutations.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation covalent EGFR inhibitor that is used in treating non-small cell lung cancer. First-generation EGFR inhibitors were found to elicit pro-differentiation effect on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in preclinical studies, but clinical trials yielded mostly negative results. Here, we report that osimertinib selectively induced apoptosis of CD34+ leukemia stem/progenitor cells but not CD34- cells in EGFR-negative AML and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Covalent binding of osimertinib to CD34 at cysteines 199 and 177 and suppression of Src family kinases (SFK) and downstream STAT3 activation contributed to osimertinib-induced cell death. SFK and STAT3 inhibition induced synthetic lethality with osimertinib in primary CD34+ cells. CD34 expression was elevated in AML cells compared with their normal counterparts. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling identified mutation and gene expression signatures of patients with AML with high CD34 expression, and univariate and multivariate analyses indicated the adverse prognostic significance of high expression of CD34. Osimertinib treatment induced responses in AML patient-derived xenograft models that correlated with CD34 expression while sparing normal CD34+ cells. Clinical responses were observed in two patients with CD34high AML who were treated with osimertinib on a compassionate-use basis. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of osimertinib for treating CD34high AML and CML and describe an EGFR-independent mechanism of osimertinib-induced cell death in myeloid leukemia. Osimertinib binds CD34 and selectively kills CD34+ leukemia cells to induce remission in preclinical models and patients with AML with a high percentage of CD34+ blasts, providing therapeutic options for myeloid leukemia patients.",

    "abstract": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) has been reported in older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following the use of osimertinib, the third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, there have not been analytic epidemiology studies on this topic. We aimed to compare the risk of LQTS between osimertinib and first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs in older patients with advanced NSCLC. This retrospective observational study used the 2006-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data and included older patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with either osimertinib or first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs during 2007-2017. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance the two groups with propensity scores estimated based on the patients' socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Crude incidence rate (IR) and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of the primary outcome, incident LQTS, were estimated. A total of 545 and 1,135 patients were included in the osimertinib and first/second-generation EGFR-TKI groups, which increased to 1,614 and 1,659, respectively, after IPTW. The osimertinib group had a higher IR of LQTS (2.62 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 2.03-3.38) compared to the first/second-generation EGFR-TKI group (1.33 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0.92-1.92). After adjusting for covariates, the osimertinib group had a higher risk of LQTS than the first/second-generation EGFR-TKI group, with an HR of 1.94 (95% CI 1.23-3.08). The increased LQTS risk in the osimertinib group was even higher in females, whites and patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200975. Given the elevated risk of LQTS associated with osimertinib user, close monitoring for cardiac rhythm irregularities of high-risk patients following initiation of EGFR-TKI is recommended. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) indicates a disorder of heart beats with prolonged QT intervals. There have been reports of LQTS in older patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). We conducted a retrospective study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, including older patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 with advanced NSCLC who were treated with EGFR-TKIs. Our results show higher incidence of LQTS after using osimertinib than first/second-generation EGFR-TKIs. After adjusting for patients\u2019 characteristics that might have affected the incidence of LQTS, the risk of LQTS was significantly higher in osimertinib users than in earlier generation EGFR-TKI users. Females, whites, and patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200975 had an even higher risk of LQTS when treated with osimertinib. Close monitoring for cardiac rhythm irregularities in high-risk patients after osimertinib initiation is recommended.",

An exploratory analysis of 26 patients in the IMpower150 study indicated that treatment with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel (ABCP) was effective in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. This phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of ABCP in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients after TKI treatment. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations were enrolled. ABCP therapy was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) according to extramural review (ER). Key secondary endpoints and preplanned analysis included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and differences in the efficacy of ABCP according to prior EGFR-TKI administration, liver metastases, and brain metastases. Sixty patients from 26 centers were enrolled. Median PFS was 7.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7-8.2). The median OS was 23.1 months (95% CI: 13.1-not reached), and the ORR was 55.9%.

    "title": "Uncovering the Structural and Binding Insights of Dual Inhibitors Simultaneously Targeting Two Distinct Sites on EGFR Kinase.",
    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the first growth factor receptor identified in normal cells that is related to the receptor tyrosine kinase, which causes regular cell division. A point mutation in EGFR intracellular kinase domain forces the abnormal cell divisions throughout time, leading to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) transformation. Thus, competitive inhibitors that bind to the ATP binding pocket have been developed as a targeted therapy for NSCLC. The third-generation kinase inhibitor Osimertinib is currently playing a very vital role in the treatment of NSCLC. However, it is not effective toward the C797S kinase domain mutation. For this reason, fourth-generation kinase noncompetitive inhibitors are introduced which work through binding to an allosteric pocket near the ATP binding region and act as a better binding agent for this mutated kinase domain. However, the problem is that these single fourth-generation kinase inhibitors may not be as effective as a single agent. The aim of this work was to apply combinations of these two inhibitors together in different binding regions of EGFR without overlapping the resistance mechanism to obtain the key direct and indirect interactions occurring between them. Moreover, the free energy of dissociation of an inhibitor from its binding sites in the presence of a second inhibitor immobilized in another binding site was also the focus of the study. To realize this aim, we performed conventional molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation matrices along with umbrella sampling. Our results demonstrated that binding of dual inhibitors triggered conformational changes of the protein more toward the inactive state. Furthermore, allosteric inhibitors bound more strongly to protein kinase EGFR than the orthosteric inhibitors in the presence of dual inhibitors. Finally, the binding mechanism and important hydrogen-bonding residues during unbinding of the inhibitors were fully elucidated. This study provides insight into the binding of the receptor-orthosteric inhibitor-allosteric inhibitor, which can be helpful for further design of novel inhibitors that have a better inhibitory action.",

In the cEFR, CNS ORRs (95% CI) were 88% (73 to 96) versus 87% (72 to 96); 48% versus 16% had CNS CR. Osimertinib plus platinum-pemetrexed demonstrated improved CNS efficacy compared with osimertinib monotherapy, including delaying CNS progression, irrespective of baseline CNS metastasis status. These data support this combination as a new first-line treatment for patients with ",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) result in improvement in survival for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Unfortunately, most patients who initially respond to EGFR-TKI ultimately develop resistance to therapy, resulting in cancer progression and relapse. Combination therapy is today a common strategy for the treatment of tumors to increase the success rate, improve the outcome and survival of patients, and avoid the selection of resistant cancer cells through the activation of compensatory pathways. In NSCLC, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been heavily implicated in both tumorigenesis and the progression of disease. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a PI3K \u03b4-sparing inhibitor, MEN1611, in models of NSCLC sensitive and resistant to EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib and gefitinib) with a wild-type  We performed functional, biochemical, and immunohistochemistry studies.

    "abstract": "Gefitinib, as the first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has achieved great advances in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but drug resistance will inevitably occur. Therefore, exploring the resistance mechanism of gefitinib and developing new combination treatment strategies are of great importance. In our study, the results showed that selumetinib (AZD6244) synergistically inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC with gefitinib. Selumetinib also enhanced gefitinib-induced apoptosis and migration inhibition ability in gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cell lines. Subsequently, the negative regulation between MIG6 and STAT3 was observed and verified through the STRING database and western blotting assays. Sustained activation of STAT3 was significantly downregulated when co-treatment with selumetinib in gefitinib-resistant cells. However, the downregulation of p-STAT3, resulting from the combination of selumetinib and gefitinib was counteracted by the deletion of MIG6, suggesting that selumetinib enhanced gefitinib sensitivity by regulating MIG6/STAT3 in NSCLC. In contrast, p-STAT3 was further inhibited after treatment with gefitinib and selumetinib when MIG6 was overexpressed. Furthermore, the combined administration of selumetinib and gefitinib effectively promoted the sensitivity of lung cancer xenografts to gefitinib in vivo, and the tumor inhibition rate reached 81.49%, while the tumor inhibition rate of the gefitinib monotherapy group was only 31.95%. Overall, MIG6/STAT3 negative regulation plays an important role in the sustained activation of STAT3 and the resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Our study also suggests that EGFR-TKIs combined with MEK1/2 inhibitors, such as selumetinib, may be beneficial to those NSCLC patients who develop a primary or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, providing theoretical support for combining TKIs and selumetinib in clinical cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective and valuable treatment option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations, such as T790M. However, acquired resistance ultimately limits its clinical application. In this study, we aimed to identify potential targets for overcoming osimertinib resistance. The H1975/OSI cell line was induced in vitro through intermittent induction. Cell activity was measured using a cell counting kit-8 assay. Uni-omics and multi-omics analyses were conducted on the transcriptomic and proteomic (4D label-free) expression profiles, which involved differential expression analysis, GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, as well as correlation analysis of transcription factors and PPI network. H1975/OSI cells showed resistance towards osimertinib with IC50 values approximately 5.25-fold higher than H1975 cells. A total of 2519 genes were found to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 1533 proteins were found to be differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Furthermore, 147 genes that were differentially expressed at both the transcription and protein levels (TPGs) were identified as being differentially expressed in both the transcriptome and proteome. It was revealed that many pathways related to the structure and function of ribosomes, as well as metabolites, were altered. The highest connectivity genes of 147 TPGs included NOP56, DDX21, PDCD11, CCNB1, and TOP2A. The hub genes of the transcriptional regulatory network included DDX21, KPNA2, DDX5, BRCA1, LMNB1, and HIF1A. Collectively, our high-throughput analysis uncovered functional properties that interacted with gene signatures of H1975/OSI cells, and highlighted certain pathways and eleven hub genes that may be the potential targets for improving clinical osimertinib resistance.",

GW4869 inhibited the expression of eHSP90\u03b1, EMT, invasion and migration abilities of HCC827 and PC9. GW4869 enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib in BALB/c nude mice bearing tumors of HCC827.

The prognostic usefulness of ctDNA after first-line epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are limited. Therefore, the present study evaluated ctDNA during osimertinib administration as a second-line or more setting to identify the relationship between EGFR mutation levels and outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Forty patients with EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC receiving osimertinib after prior EGFR-TKI treatment were registered. Plasma samples were collected at osimertinib pretreatment, after 1\u00a0month of treatment, and at the time of progressive disease (PD). ctDNA analysis was performed by digital polymerase chain reaction. The detection rate of copy numbers of exon 19 deletion, L858R, and T790M in plasma samples was significantly lower 1\u00a0month after osimertinib than at pretreatment, and significantly higher at PD than at 1\u00a0month, whereas that of C797S was significantly higher at PD than at 1\u00a0month. No statistically significant difference was observed in the copy numbers of exon 19 deletion, L858R, T790M, and C797S between complete response or partial response and stable disease or PD. The detection of T790M at PD after osimertinib initiation was a significant independent prognostic factor for predicting shorter prognosis, and the presence of major EGFR mutations at pretreatment and PD was closely linked to worse survival after osimertinib initiation. Molecular testing based on ctDNA is helpful for predicting outcomes of osimertinib treatment in T790M-positive NSCLC after previous EGFR-TKI treatment.",

Patients were randomized 1:1 and received osimertinib 80\u2009mg once daily (q.d.) or comparator EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib 250\u2009mg q.d. or erlotinib 150\u2009mg q.d.).

Patients with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) imaging data and detectable EGFR mutations (Ex19del/L858R) at baseline and \u2265\u20093 additional timepoints were evaluable. Joint modeling was conducted to characterize the relationship between longitudinal changes in ctDNA and probability of progression-free survival (PFS). A Bayesian joint model of ctDNA and PFS was developed solving differential equations with the ctDNA dynamics and the PFS time-to-event probability. Of 556 patients, 353 had detectable ctDNA at baseline.

However, acquired resistance is inevitable after 8-12\u2009months treatment. New agents or treatments are urgently required to resolve this problem. In this study, we identified that compound ZYZ384 can selectively inhibit the growth of gefitinib-resistant (G-R) lung cancer cells, without affecting that of normal lung epithelial cells. ZYZ384 induced G2 arrest in G-R NSCLC cells, decreasing the expression of Cyclin B1 and increasing the expression of P21. Meanwhile, ZYZ384 also induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells and correspondingly increased the expression of cleaved Caspase 3, 8, and 9 proteins. The expression of p-JNK, p-P38, and p-ERK were also increased in H1975 NSCLC cells treated with ZYZ384. Finally, we observed that the JNK inhibitor effectively reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of ZYZ384. In conclusion, ZYZ384 is a potential therapeutic agent to inhibit the growth of NSCLCs with EGFR mutations through activating JNK, which will help the development of related anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of new-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has afforded promising overall survival outcomes in clinical trials for non-small-cell lung cancer. We aim to investigate the current adoption rate of these agents and the real-world impact on overall survival among institutions. In a nationwide retrospective cohort study of 46 Tokushukai Medical Group hospitals in Japan, we analyzed clinical data of consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer receiving EGFR-TKIs between April 2010 and March 2020. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses examined the associations between overall survival and patient/tumor-related factors and first-line EGFR-TKIs. A total of 758 patients (58.5% females; median age, 73\u00a0years) were included. Of 40 patients diagnosed in 2010, 72.5% received gefitinib, whereas 81.3% of 107 patients diagnosed in 2019 received osimertinib as the first-line EGFR-TKI. With a median follow-up of 15.8\u00a0months, the median overall survival was 28.4\u00a0months (95% confidence interval, 15.3-31.0). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, age, body mass index, disease status, EGFR mutational status and first-line epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor were identified as significant prognostic factors after adjusting for background factors including study period, hospital volume and hospital type. The estimated 2-year overall survival rates for gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and osimertinib were 70.1% (95% confidence interval 59.7-82.4), 67.8% (95% confidence interval 55.3-83.2), 75.5% (95% confidence interval 64.7-88.0) and 90.8% (95% confidence interval 84.8-97.3), respectively. The median time to treatment failure of gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib and osimertinib were 12.8, 8.8, 12.0 and 16.9\u00a0months or more, respectively. Our real-world data revealed that the swift and widespread utilization of newer-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, and that these newer-generation EGFR-TKIs can prolong overall survival regardless of hospital volume or type. Therefore, osimertinib could be a reasonable first choice treatment for these patients across various clinical practice settings.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the primary treatment for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, evidence of the outcomes of osimertinib treatment in patients over 75\u00a0years of age in the real-world setting is limited. This retrospective study analyzed the data of 538 patients (203 elderly and 335 non-elderly) with EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer in whom osimertinib was initiated as first-line treatment between August 2018 and December 2019. Patients over 75\u00a0years of age were classified as elderly. The data cut-off date was February 28, 2022. The progression-free survival (PFS) did not significantly differ between the elderly and non-elderly groups [elderly group: median PFS, 16.9\u00a0months (95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI), 14.3-20.2); non-elderly group: median PFS, 22.1\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI: 19.5-26.3); hazard ratio (HR) for the elderly against the non-elderly: 1.21 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.98-1.50), p\u00a0=\u00a00.079]. However, the time to treatment failure (TTF) was significantly shorter in the elderly than in the non-elderly [elderly group: median TTF, 14.0\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI: 0.98-1.50); non-elderly group: median TTF, 21.8\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI: 18.2-24.6); HR for the elderly against the non-elderly: 1.46 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.20-1.77), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. Furthermore, the rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 28.6\u00a0% in the elderly and 14.9\u00a0% in the non-elderly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Among patients who discontinued treatment, the conversion rate to second-line treatment was 39.6\u00a0% in the elderly and 72.8\u00a0% in the non-elderly. In addition, the median overall survival was 30\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI: 25.8-37.7) in the elderly and not reached (NR) (95\u00a0% CI: NR-NR) in the non-elderly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In a real-world clinical setting, elderly patients receiving osimertinib as first-line treatment should be aware of the frequent inability to transition to second-line treatment due to adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with uncommon EGFR mutations is a rare subgroup, composing 14% of all EGFR mutations. To determine the usefulness of osimertinib in previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations, excluding exon 20 insertion mutations. This multicenter, open-label, single-group, phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial enrolled patients from April 10, 2020, to May 31, 2022, with a follow-up of 6 months from the date the last patient was enrolled. The study enrolled 42 patients with uncommon EGFR mutations, of whom 40 were eligible. Osimertinib, 80 mg once daily, was administered orally to patients. The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). The secondary end points were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), and safety of osimertinib. Patients were included in the study on an intention-to-treat basis. Of the 40 eligible patients, 22 were men (55.0%) and the median age was 72 years (range, 39.0-88.0 years). The most common mutations were G719X (20 [50.0%]), S768I (10 [25.0%]), and L861Q (8 [20.0%]). The ORR was 55.0% (90% CI, 40.9%-68.5%) and the DCR was 90.0% (95% CI, 76.3%-97.2%). The median PFS was 9.4 months (95% CI, 3.7-15.2 months) after a median follow-up of 12.7 months (range, 2.7-30.7 months). The median TTF was 9.5 months (95% CI, 5.6-30.3 months), median OS was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 19.3 months to NR), and median DoR was 22.7 months (95% CI, 9.5 months to NR). The ORR for patients with solitary or compound uncommon EGFR mutations was 45.5% (90% CI, 26.9%-65.3%) and 66.7% (90% CI, 43.7%-83.7%), respectively. Median PFS for patients with solitary or compound uncommon EGFR mutations was 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.6-22.7 months) and 9.8 months (95% CI, 5.1 months to NR), respectively. Median OS for patients with solitary or compound uncommon EGFR mutations was 23.0 months (95% CI, 12.3 months to NR) and NR, respectively. Median DoR for patients with solitary or compound uncommon EGFR mutations was 22.7 months (95% CI, 3.6-22.7 months) or NR (95% CI, 5.7 months to NR), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported by 11 patients (27.5%), and 5 patients (12.5%) developed interstitial lung disease. All adverse events were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Osimertinib showed clinical activity with manageable toxic effects among previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations other than exon 20 insertion mutations. The results support the use of osimertinib as a treatment option for this patient population. Japan Registry of Clinical Trials Identifier: jRCTs071200002.",

We determined the impact of this hallmark, along with EGFR subtype and generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, on patients' outcome. 553 metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients received front-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and secondary T790M rate were analysed. BM was observed in 211 (38.2%) patients. BM (HR 1.20 [95% CI 0.99-1.48]; p\u2009=\u20090.053), ECOG PS 0-1 (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.54-0.93]; p\u2009=\u20090.014) and afatinib treatment (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.66-0.99]; p\u2009=\u20090.045) were associated with PFS. Afatinib-treated patients without BM demonstrated a significantly longer PFS (16.3\u00a0months) compared to afatinib-treated patients with BM (13.7\u00a0months) and to gefitinib/erlotinib-treated patients with (11.1\u00a0months) or without BM (14.2\u00a0months; p\u2009<\u20090.001).

In BM patients, gefitinib/erlotinib-treated ones with 19 deletion mutation and afatinib-treated ones with L858R mutation had the highest and the lowest T790M rate (94.4% vs. 27.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. BM and generation of EGFR-TKI jointly impact PFS and secondary T790M rate in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, whereas OS was mainly associated with EGFR subtype.",

    "abstract": "The relative efficacies of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after surgery remain unclear. Among 801 patients with NSCLC who underwent pulmonary resection at Kanazawa Medical University between 2017 and 2021, sixty-four patients had recurrence. We retrospectively compared the efficacies of EGFR-TKIs and ICIs in these patients with recurrent NSCLC who underwent pulmonary resection. The 3-year overall survival rates after recurrence were 79.3% in patients who received EGFR-TKIs, 69.5% in patients who received ICIs, and 43.7% in patients who received cytotoxic agents. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients treated with EGFR-TKIs and ICIs (p = 0.14) or between patients treated with ICIs and cytotoxic agents (p = 0.23), but overall survival was significantly higher in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs compared with cytotoxic agents (p &lt; 0.01). The probabilities of a 2-year response were 88.5%, 61.6%, and 25.9% in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, ICIs, and cytotoxic agents, respectively. There was no significant difference in response periods between patients treated with EGFR-TKIs and ICIs (p = 0.18), but the response period was significantly better in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs (p &lt; 0.01) or ICIs (p = 0.03) compared with cytotoxic agents. Percent-predicted vital capacity (p = 0.03) and epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation (p &lt; 0.01) were significant factors affecting the overall response to chemotherapy in multivariate analysis. EGFR-TKIs and ICIs are effective for treating recurrent NSCLC after surgery. Although adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected pathological stage II to IIIA NSCLC, atezolizumab or osimertinib, has also been recently approved as adjuvant chemotherapy, there is a risk that patients who relapse after adjuvant chemotherapy will have less choice.",

    "abstract": "EGFR C797X (C797S or C797G) mutation is the most frequent on-target mechanism of resistance to osimertinib. The hypothesis that the allelic context of C797X/T790M has implications for treatment is on the basis of sporadic reports and needs validation with larger cohorts. We identified patients with EGFR C797X-mutant NSCLC from nine centers who progressed on osimertinib, all analyzed in a single laboratory through next-generation sequencing. We analyzed genomic profiles and assessed associations between clinical outcomes and C797X status. A total of 365 EGFR C797X-mutant cases were categorized into four subtypes on the basis of allelic context: in cis (75.3%), in trans (6.4%), cis&trans (10.4%), and C797X-only (7.9%). Genomically, the cis&trans subtype displayed the highest frequency of concurrent alterations at osimertinib resistance sites (21.1%), while the in cis subtype had the lowest (8.4%). Clinically, cis&trans patients exhibited the worst progression-free survival (PFS) on both previous (median 7.7 mo) and subsequent treatment (median 1.0 mo) and overall survival (median 3.9 mo). In subsequent treatments, in cis patients exhibited superior PFS with combined brigatinib and cetuximab (median 11.0 mo) compared with other regimens (p\u00a0= 0.005), while in trans patients exhibited variable outcomes with combined first or second- and third-generation EGFR inhibitor (PFS range: 0.7-8.1 mo, median 2.6 mo). Notably, subtype switching was observed after subsequent treatments, predominantly toward the in cis subtype. Allelic context could define four EGFR C797X-mutant NSCLC subtypes with heterogeneous genetic landscapes and distinct clinical outcomes. Subsequent treatments further complicate the scenario through subtype switching.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive genotyping is necessary to identify therapy options for patients with advanced cancer; however, many cancers are not tested, partly because of tissue limitations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) liquid biopsies overcome some limitations, but clinical validity is not established and adoption is limited. Herein, clinical bridging studies used pretreatment plasma samples and data from FLAURA (NCT02296125; n\u00a0=\u00a0441) and AURA3 (NCT02151981; n\u00a0=\u00a0450) pivotal studies to demonstrate clinical validity of Guardant360 CDx (NGS LBx) to identify patients with advanced EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who may benefit from osimertinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients with EGFR mutation as identified by NGS LBx had significant PFS benefit with first-line osimertinib over standard of care (15.2 versus 9.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.41; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and with later-line osimertinib over chemotherapy (8.3 versus 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.34; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). PFS benefits were similar to the original trial cohorts selected by tissue-based EGFR testing. Analytical validation included accuracy, precision, limit of detection, and specificity. Analytical validity was established for EGFR mutation detection and pan-tumor profiling. Panel-wide limit of detection was 0.1% to 0.5%, with 98% to 100% per-sample specificity. Patients with EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung cancer by NGS LBx had improved PFS with osimertinib, confirming clinical validity. Analytical validity was established for guideline-recommended therapeutic targets across solid tumors. The resulting US Food and Drug Administration approval of NGS LBx demonstrated safety and effectiveness for its intended use and is expected to improve adherence to guideline-recommended targeted therapy use.",

    "abstract": "Despite consistent progress in prompt diagnosis and curative therapies in the last decade, lung cancer (LC) continues to threaten mankind, accounting for nearly twice the casualties compared to prostate, breast, and other cancers. Statistics associate ~25% of 2021 cancer-related deaths with LC, more than 80% of which are explicitly caused by tobacco smoking. Prevailing as small and non-small cell pathologies, with respective occurring frequency of nearly 15% and 80-85%, non-small cell LCs (NSCLCs) are prominently distinguished into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), subtypes. Since the first use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib for NSCLC treatment in 2002, immense progress has been made for targeted therapies with the next generation of drugs spanning across the chronological generations of small molecule inhibitors. The last two years have overseen the clinical approval of more than 10 therapeutic agents as first-line NSCLC medications. However, uncertain mutational aberrations as well as systemic resistant responses, and abysmal overall survival curtail the combating efficacies. Of late, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) against various molecules including programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have been demonstrated as reliable LC treatment targets. Keeping these aspects in mind, this review article discusses the success of NSCLC chemo and immunotherapies with their characteristic effectiveness and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib is a potent and selective orally active growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is commonly used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations. Hearing impairment with gefitinib was sparsely reported. In this report, we describe a case of sensorineural deafness associated with the administration of gefitinib, with a Naranjo score of 7. An 81-year-old female was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastasis and an EGFR-activating mutation. The patient was prescribed gefitinib tablets at a daily dose of 250\u2009mg for lung adenocarcinoma treatment. However, the patient experienced moderate to severe bilateral sensorineural deafness, primarily in her right ear, after taking gefitinib. Following the cessation of gefitinib administration, the patient exhibited partial restoration of auditory function. Upon resuming the medication, she experienced a worsening of deafness. The otoscopic audiogram and hearing test indicated moderate to severe bilateral sensorineural deafness. The otolaryngologist recommended bilateral hearing aids to enhance hearing function. Throughout our follow-up period, the patient did not receive a hearing aid implant. This article first reported the ototoxicity caused by gefitinib. While rare, our report highlights that gefitinib-induced sensorineural deafness is possible and its mechanisms are still unclear. This adverse reaction should be monitored closely during clinical application of gefitinib to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to osimertinib in advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes a significant challenge for clinicians either in terms of molecular diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic implications. This is a prospective single-centre study with the primary objective of characterising resistance mechanisms to osimertinib in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated both in first- and in second-line. Next-Generation Sequencing analysis was conducted on paired tissue biopsies and plasma samples. A concordance analysis between tissue and plasma was performed. Sixty-five advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib in first- (n\u2009=\u200956) or in second-line (n\u2009=\u20099) were included. We managed to perform tissue and liquid biopsies in 65.5% and 89.7% of patients who experienced osimertinib progression, respectively. Acquired resistance mechanisms were identified in 80% of 25 patients with post-progression samples, with MET amplification (n\u2009=\u20098), EGFR C797S (n\u2009=\u20093), and SCLC transformation (n\u2009=\u20092) the most frequently identified. The mean concordance rates between tissue and plasma for the EGFR activating mutation and for the molecular resistance mechanisms were 87.5% and 22.7%, respectively. Resistance to osimertinib demonstrated to be highly heterogeneous, with MET amplification the main mechanism. Plasma genotyping is a relevant complementary tool which might integrate tissue analysis for the study of resistance mechanisms.",

After treatment failure with first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a T790M mutation was revealed by liquid biopsy. Hemodialysis was started three times a week because chronic renal failure worsened during treatment. Although the subsequent administration of osimertinib (80 mg daily) resulted in a tumor shrinkage and a gradual increase in the plasma concentration of osimertinib, which resulted in grade 3 general fatigue, reducing the dosage of osimertinib decreased its plasma concentration, leading to an improvement in his adverse event. Subsequently, with by adjusting the dosage while periodically measuring the plasma concentration of osimertinib, a stable therapeutic effect was sustained over the long term with no symptoms. Periodic plasma concentration measurements may be indispensable for successful treatment with osimertinib in hemodialysis patients.",

Transbronchial tumor biopsies showed adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT and bone scintigraphy revealed lung, pleura, and bone metastases. The patient was diagnosed with left upper lobe adenocarcinoma cT2bN3M1c stage IVB. A genetic analysis of the primary tumor using the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx system revealed positivity for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (L858R) and CTNNB1 mutations. Based on these findings, the patient was treated with osimertinib (80 mg/day) as first-line therapy. Six months later, the tumor increased in size, indicating progressive disease. Osimertinib was stopped and second-line therapy with carboplatin (area under the curve 5) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was initiated. After three cycles of chemotherapy, the patient developed dementia and disorientation. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed miliary brain metastases. Miliary dissemination is a rare form of brain metastasis. Miliary patterns of lung metastases have been strongly associated with the EGFR exon 19 deletion. The radiological features of miliary brain metastases of non-small cell lung cancer with the exon 19 deletion have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of lung cancer with miliary brain metastases and co-mutations of EGFR (L858R) and CTNNB1. In conclusion, co-mutations of EGFR (L858R) and CTNNB1 and the discontinuation of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor may contribute to the development of miliary brain metastases.

    "abstract": "Although third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) Osimertinib has been approved as adjuvant therapy for resected stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-sensitive mutations, the optimal treatment sequencing of EGFR-TKIs, particularly whether Osimertinib should be the initial or sequential therapy following the first-generation EGFR-TKIs remains uncertain. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients with EGFR-mutated stage IIIA NSCLC who received treatment with either first-generation EGFR-TKIs or Osimertinib (third-generation) alone, or in sequential combination, at a single institution. The data analysis involved using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression. Out of the total 148 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC included in the study, 76 individuals underwent treatment with either first-generation EGFR-TKIs (referred to as subgroup \"1\u2033) or exclusively Osimertinib (subgroup \"0\u00a0+\u00a03\u2033), or a sequential combination of the two (subgroup \"1\u00a0+\u00a03\u2033) following surgery. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that there were no discernible disparities in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival between subgroup \" 1\u2033 and \" 1\u00a0+\u00a03,\" nor between subgroup \" 0\u00a0+\u00a03\u2033 and \"1\u00a0+\u00a03\". The findings from this study indicate that the introduction of third-generation EGFR-TKI Osimertinib did not yield enhanced survival benefits when compared to the first-generation drug in patients with stage IIIA completely resected NSCLC who were administered EGFR-TKIs as part of their postoperative adjuvant treatment. Additionally, within the observed sample size of this cohort, the sequential use of Osimertinib alongside first-generation EGFR-TKI did not demonstrate superiority over using either the first-generation EGFR-TKI or Osimertinib alone in terms of postoperative survival.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. CNOT3, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, has recently been suggested to be overexpressed in lung cancer and involved in tumor malignancy. However, its precise role and the underlying mechanisms still need to be fully revealed. In the present study, we found in lung cancer cells the expression of CNOT3 could be regulated by EGFR signaling pathway and c-Jun, a transcription factor downstream of EGFR, transcriptionally regulated its expression. Interestingly, CNOT3 could inversely regulate the expression of c-Jun via modulating its translation. Thus, a feedback loop existed between c-Jun and CNOT3. CNOT3 reduction post EGFR blockade facilitated the drug-induced cell death, and simultaneously inhibited cell proliferation via impacting TSC1/mTOR axis. Whereas, further up-regulation of the CNOT3 expression was observed in gefitinib-resistant cells, which dampened gefitinib sensitivity. Mechanically, the elevation of CNOT3 was induced by the bypass activation of HER2/c-Jun signaling. Depleting CNOT3 in vitro and in vivo sensitized the drug-resistant cells to gefitinib treatment and inhibited metastatic progression. These results give novel insights into the role of CNOT3 in lung cancer malignancy and provide a theoretical basis for the development of therapeutic strategies to solve acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

Adults aged \u226518 years (Taiwan \u226520 years), with resected stage II to IIIB NSCLC are eligible; prior adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed. Eligible patients must have locally confirmed common (exon 19 deletion or L858R) or uncommon (G719X, L861Q, and/or S768I) EGFR-TKI sensitizing mutations, alone or in combination. Patients will receive osimertinib 80 mg once daily for 5 years or until disease recurrence, discontinuation or death. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years (common EGFR mutations cohort). Secondary endpoints include: investigator-assessed DFS at 3 and 4 years; overall survival at 3, 4, and 5 years (common EGFR mutations cohort); DFS at 3, 4, and 5 years (uncommon EGFR mutations cohort); safety and tolerability, type of recurrence and CNS metastases (both cohorts). Exploratory endpoints include: tissue/plasma concordance; analysis of circulating molecules in plasma samples using different profiling approaches to detect minimal residual disease; incidence and change over time of incidental pulmonary nodules. TARGET is currently recruiting, and completion is expected in 2029.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is currently used as a first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer, and the emergence of drug resistance poses a substantial challenge. Liquid biopsy with a multi-gene panel can examine both the molecular mechanisms and possibility of early resistance diagnosis. We used a molecular barcode library construction kit (Archer Plasma DNA concentration was not associated with the presence or absence of resistance to osimertinib. The pathological mutations detected using next-generation sequencing in the resistant specimens were in MAP2K1, PIK3CA, TP53, BRAF, and EGFR. Among the recurrent cases, EGFR mutations identified at the initial diagnosis were detected within 6 months before relapse confirmation in four cases (average 88 days). Many of the recurrent cases without detection of known EGFR mutations in the liquid biopsy showed a longer interval between the detection of relapse and the last blood draw for the liquid biopsy (average 255 days). Frequent liquid biopsies are useful for identifying known EGFR mutations as markers for early detection of relapse. Several cancer driver mutations were observed, suggesting a variety of mechanisms of resistance in first-line osimertinib-treated lung adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been recommended as a first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Skin rash is one of the most common side effects of osimertinib, and can have an impact on patients' quality of life and follow-up. However, there are few reports on the safety and efficacy of switching therapy with osimertinib and the other three generations of TKIs. In this paper, we present a case of NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del) and MET gene amplification who developed a severe rash after 2\u2009months of treatment with osimertinib that did not recur after switching to replacement therapy with aumonertinib. Our findings indicate that aumonertinib is as effective as osimertinib in treating EGFR19del, while also exhibiting a lower occurrence of adverse skin reactions. This may result in an improved quality of life for patients.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor that is currently the first-line treatment for metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to its favorable efficacy and tolerability profile compared to previous generations of EGFR inhibitors. However, it can cause uncommon, yet serious, cardiovascular adverse effects. We present the case of a 63-year-old man with EGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with osimertinib who developed new-onset non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with biventricular dysfunction and heart failure in the context of an enlarging pericardial effusion. For the first time, we demonstrate cardiac MR imaging findings associated with osimertinib-associated cardiomyopathy, including focal late gadolinium enhancement and myocardial edema. The patient's biventricular function normalized after initiation of goal-directed medical therapy for heart failure and holding osimertinib. The patient was subsequently started on afatinib, a second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), without recurrence of cardiomyopathy. This case highlights the need to better understand osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity and strategies to optimize oncologic care in patients who develop severe cardiac toxicities from cancer therapy. It further underlines the importance of specialized multidisciplinary care of cancer patients who develop cardiotoxicities to optimize their oncologic outcomes.",

    "title": "A Case of Rapidly Progressive Diabetic Nephropathy Induced by Osimertinib.",
    "abstract": "The number of patients with diabetic nephropathy is increasing worldwide and it is important to understand the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease. In early stage diabetic nephropathy, the hyperglycemic environment leads to vascular endothelial cell damage, resulting in overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in podocytes and renal pathology of glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and mesangial hyperplasia. In diabetic nephropathy, renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops and the nephropathy progressively worsens in some cases of severe glomerular podocyte damage. Further, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) may suppress VEGF secretion via VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibition in podocytes, which results in renal TMA and rapid deterioration of diabetic nephropathy. Osimertinib, a third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKI, is approved as a first-line treatment agent for metastatic or locally advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. We encountered a case of a patient with diabetic nephropathy with lung adenocarcinoma treated with osimertinib, whose condition deteriorated from early nephropathy to end-stage renal disease in approximately 4 months. The patient had early diabetic nephropathy, but the use of a RTKI suppressed VEGF expression in podocytes, resulting in the induction of renal TMA and the development of rapidly progressive diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. It is known to cause drug-induced cardiotoxicity, including QT prolongation syndrome, heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden death. Once severe arrhythmias occur, it is difficult to continue osimertinib treatment. We report a case of a 66-year-old woman with recurrent NSCLC after concurrent chemoradiotherapy who experienced osimertinib-induced ventricular arrhythmia-causing syncope. The patient was initially treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and genetic testing revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion. Three years following treatment initiation, the primary tumor progressed, and new bone metastases developed. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent NSCLC and was treated with targeted therapy with osimertinib. On the 10th day of osimertinib administration, syncope occurred. Electrocardiography showed polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which was believed to be the cause of syncope. The patient was switched to erlotinib. Two and a half years later, disease progression in the primary lesion was observed. A liquid biopsy revealed an EGFR T790M resistance mutation. Therefore, osimertinib (40 mg) was administered every alternate day. After confirming the absence of palpitations and arrhythmias on electrocardiogram, the osimertinib dosing was increased to 40 mg daily. Thereafter, no further events occurred, and tumor shrinkage was observed. Low-dose osimertinib rechallenge after induced ventricular arrhythmia may be considered an option under close monitoring; however, osimertinib rechallenge must be carefully selected based on the risk-benefit analysis.",

Conversely, EGFR exon 20 insertions (exon20ins) are resistant to the traditional EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In May 2021, the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) provided accelerated approval to amivantamab (Rybrevant) in adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon20ins after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Amivantamab was the first EGFR/MET bispecific antibody to be approved specifically for EGFR exon20ins where there was an unmet need. Furthermore, amivantamab is being evaluated in additional settings such as post osimertinib in sensitizing EGFR mutations as well as in MET altered NSCLC.

    "abstract": "The incidence and mortality of lung cancer rank first among malignant tumors in China. Among them, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most important pathological type, accounting for 80%-85% of lung cancer patients, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and other pathological subtypes. In recent years, with the discovery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and the successful development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the treatment efficacy of stage \u2163 NSCLC patients with EGFR gene sensitive mutation has been greatly improved. As of August 23, 2023, the first generation EGFR-TKIs, gefitinib, icotinib, and erlotinib; the second generation EGFR-TKIs, afatinib and dacomitinib; and the third generation EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib, almonertinib, furmonertinib and befotertinib were all approved for marketing by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). In addition, multiple domestic third-generation EGFR-TKIs are undergoing clinical trials, such as rezivertinib (BPI-7711), limertinib (ASK120067), and oritinib (SH-1028). Meanwhile, mobocertinib and sunvozertinib, which targets EGFR 20ins mutations, were also approved by NMPA. With the increasing variety of EGFR-TKIs approved for marketing subsequently, it brings confusion to clinicians when choosing specific medications, and there is an urgent need to develop relevant treatment guidelines. Hence, the Medical Oncology Branch of China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Health Care and the Chinese Association for Clinical Oncologists convened experts to integrate the research results of various EGFR-TKIs, and proposed the \"China clinical practice guideline for epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in stage \u2163 non-small cell lung cancer (version 2023)\", to provide reference for better clinical practice. \u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u80ba\u764c\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5747\u5c45\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u9996\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08NSCLC\uff09\u662f\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5360\u5168\u90e8\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u768480%~85%\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u817a\u764c\u3001\u9cde\u764c\u7b49\u75c5\u7406\u4e9a\u578b\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff08EGFR\uff09\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\uff08TKIs\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7814\u53d1\uff0cEGFR\u57fa\u56e0\u654f\u611f\u7a81\u53d8\u9633\u6027\u2163\u671fNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5f88\u5927\u6539\u5584\u3002\u622a\u81f3 2023\u5e748\u670823\u65e5\uff0c\u88ab\u4e2d\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u836f\u54c1\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\u6279\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ee3EGFR-TKIs\u5305\u62ec\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u3001\u57c3\u514b\u66ff\u5c3c\u548c\u5384\u6d1b\u66ff\u5c3c\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4ee3EGFR-TKIs\u5305\u62ec\u963f\u6cd5\u66ff\u5c3c\u548c\u8fbe\u53ef\u66ff\u5c3c\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3EGFR-TKIs\u5305\u62ec\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u3001\u963f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\u3001\u4f0f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\u548c\u8d1d\u798f\u66ff\u5c3c\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u4ea7\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3EGFR-TKIs\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5982\u745e\u9f50\u66ff\u5c3c\uff08BPI-7711\uff09\u3001\u5229\u5384\u66ff\u5c3c\uff08ASK120067\uff09\u3001\u5965\u745e\u66ff\u5c3c\uff08SH-1028\uff09\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u8fd8\u6709\u9488\u5bf9EGFR 20ins\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u83ab\u535a\u8d5b\u66ff\u5c3c\u548c\u8212\u6c83\u66ff\u5c3c\u4e5f\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u6279\u4e0a\u5e02\u3002\u968f\u7740\u9646\u7eed\u83b7\u6279\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684EGFR-TKIs\u79cd\u7c7b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u4f53\u836f\u7269\u7ed9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u4e9f\u987b\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u6cbb\u7597\u6307\u5357\u3002\u6709\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u56fd\u9645\u4ea4\u6d41\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f1a\u80bf\u7624\u5185\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u4f1a\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u533b\u5e08\u534f\u4f1a\u80bf\u7624\u533b\u5e08\u5206\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6574\u5408\u5404\u7c7bEGFR-TKIs\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u4e86\u300a\u2163\u671f\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\u4e2d\u56fd\u6cbb\u7597\u6307\u5357\uff082023\u5e74\u7248\uff09\u300b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u501f\u9274\u3002.",

These combinations were evaluated in a global phase III trial. A total of 657 patients with EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletions or L858R) locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after disease progression on osimertinib were randomized 2 : 2 : 1 to receive amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy, chemotherapy, or amivantamab-chemotherapy. The dual primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) of amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. During the study, hematologic toxicities observed in the amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy arm necessitated a regimen change to start lazertinib after carboplatin completion. All baseline characteristics were well balanced across the three arms, including by history of brain metastases and prior brain radiation. PFS was significantly longer for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) for disease progression or death 0.48 and 0.44, respectively; P < 0.001 for both; median of 6.3 and 8.3 versus 4.2 months, respectively]. Consistent PFS results were seen by investigator assessment (HR for disease progression or death 0.41 and 0.38 for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy, respectively; P < 0.001 for both; median of 8.2 and 8.3 versus 4.2 months, respectively). Objective response rate was significantly higher for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (64% and 63% versus 36%, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Median intracranial PFS was 12.5 and 12.8 versus 8.3 months for amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (HR for intracranial disease progression or death 0.55 and 0.58, respectively). Predominant adverse events (AEs) in the amivantamab-containing regimens were hematologic, EGFR-, and MET-related toxicities. Amivantamab-chemotherapy had lower rates of hematologic AEs than amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy. Amivantamab-chemotherapy and amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy improved PFS and intracranial PFS versus chemotherapy in a population with limited options after disease progression on osimertinib. Longer follow-up is needed for the modified amivantamab-lazertinib-chemotherapy regimen.",

Although the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) was not met, we searched for molecular predictors of adjuvant gefitinib efficacy. Of 234 patients enrolled in the IMPACT study, 202 patients were analyzed for 409 cancer-related gene mutations and tumor mutation burden using resected lung cancer specimens. Frequent somatic mutations included tumor protein p53 (TP53; 58.4%), CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3 (CSMD3; 11.8%), and NOTCH1 (9.9%). Multivariate analysis showed that NOTCH1 co-mutation was a significant poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in the gefitinib group and cAMP response element binding protein (CREBBP) co-mutation for DFS and OS in the cis/vin group. In patients with NOTCH1 co-mutations, gefitinib group had a shorter OS than cis/vin group (Hazard ratio 5.49, 95% CI 1.07-28.00), with a significant interaction (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.039). In patients with CREBBP co-mutations, the gefitinib group had a longer DFS than the cis/vin group, with a significant interaction (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.058).

    "abstract": "Osimertinib (Osm) is the preferred treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation. Nevertheless, the resistance of NSCLC cells to Osm will eventually develop, which remains the biggest obstacle to treating such diseases. Raddeanin A (RA) exhibits a potent anti-tumor effect on various types of cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RA suppresses NSCLC growth and increases the therapeutic effect of Osm. The effects of RA on inhibiting NSCLC cell viability and proliferation were tested using cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and EdU assay. The roles of RA in improving the anti-tumor effect of Osm were tested with CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The roles of RA in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis were assessed using quantitative real- time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis. RA treatment decreased A549 and H1975 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent way. RA inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and tumor growth  RA inhibited the NSCLC growth and increased the anti-tumor role of Osm in NSCLC by facilitating ROS/NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis. These results suggested that combination therapy with RA and Osm might be an effective strategy to treat Osm-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often complicated by leptomeningeal metastases (LMs), especially in patients carrying EGFR mutations. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the first-line drug for patients with specific gene mutations, such as EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation. However, after long-term TKI use, patients eventually develop drug resistance and acquire new mutations. Acquiring the EGFR T790\u00a0M mutation during TKI treatment is a marker for first/second generation TKI resistance. Osimertinib (a third-generation TKI) could overcome this resistance, especially for patients who have already developed NSCLC-LM. Treating NSCLC patients with osimertinib resistance is challenging. Our aim was to investigate whether afatinib is effective in NSCLC-LM patient who showed resistance to osimertinib. Herein, we report two patients with resistance to first- and third-generation TKIs who benefited from second-generation TKI. Case one: A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with stage 3A NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion. He underwent surgery and received 4 rounds of chemotherapy (oxaliplatin combined with liposomal paclitaxel), after which the disease was controlled by icotinib (a first-generation TKI) for 4 years. Then, he showed poor drug response and bone metastasis. A liquid biopsy was carried out, and the EGFR L858R/T790\u00a0M compound mutation was found. The patient was given osimertinib (a third-generation TKI). The patient was in a stable condition for 2 years and then he developed bilateral peripheral facial palsy. Brain MRI showed enhancement in the left temporal lobe and meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology detected tumour cells in the CSF. NSCLC-LM was diagnosed. His performance status (PS) score was 3-4. Liquid biopsy and next-generation sequencing were performed again. Different gene mutations and copy number alterations were found this time, including EGFR L858R, but without the EGFR T790\u00a0M mutation. His disease was controlled with intrathecal methotrexate and oral afatinib (a second generation TKI). The patient has shown clinical remission (PS score: 1-2) until now, which is longer than 10 months. A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with NSCLC in May 2020. He underwent one round of chemotherapy before thoracoscopic partial lobectomy of the right upper lung. Histological study of the lung tissue showed lung adenocarcinoma with the EGFR L858R mutation. Then, the disease was controlled with icotinib. One year later, he was diagnosed with NSCLC-LM. Liquid biopsy and sequencing showed an EGFR L858R/S768I compound mutation. The patient was treated with osimertinib. His condition was stable for 5 months before his central nervous system (CNS) symptoms were exacerbated. Liquid biopsy and sequencing were carried out again, and his gene mutation profile had not changed much. Then, the patient was given afatinib, and his condition has remained stable for 11 months. Afatinib might be suitable for NSCLC-LM patients with EGFR compound mutations who show resistance to icotinib and osimertinib, since it might help overcome first- and third-generation TKI resistance.",

    "title": "Intrinsic Resistance to Osimertinib in EGFR Mutated NSCLC Cell Lines Induced by Alteration in Cell-Cycle Regulators.",
    "abstract": "Cell-cycle regulators are mutated in approximately 40% of all cancer types and have already been linked to worse outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas treated with osimertinib. However, their exact role in osimertinib resistance has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how the CDK4/6-Rb axis may affect the sensitivity to osimertinib. We genetically increased the level of CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and reduced the levels of CDKN2A (p16) in two different adenocarcinoma cell lines, PC9 and HCC827. We also retrospectively evaluated the outcome of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer depending on their level of Cyclin D1 and p16. The modified clones showed higher proliferative capacity, modifications in cell-cycle phases, and higher migratory capacity than the parental cells. Cyclin D1-overexpressing clones were highly resistant to acute osimertinib treatment. CDKN2A knockdown conferred intrinsic resistance as well, although a longer time was required for adaption to the drug. In both cases, the resistant phenotype was epidermal growth factor receptor independent and associated with a higher level of Rb phosphorylation, which was unaffected by osimertinib treatment. Blocking the phosphorylation of Rb using abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, exerted an additive effect with osimertinib, increasing sensitivity to this drug and reverting the intrinsic resistant phenotype. In a group of 32 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, assessed for Cyclin D1 and p16 expression, we found that the p16-deleted group presented a lower overall response rate compared with the control group. We conclude that perturbation in cell-cycle regulators leads to intrinsic osimertinib resistance and worse patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The clinical outcomes of sequential treatment of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with first-line bevacizumab combined with 1st/2nd-generation EGFR-TKIs are unclear. Thus, we aimed to analyze the outcomes of these patients. Between January 2015 and December 2020, data for 102 advanced EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients receiving first-line bevacizumab combined with erlotinib or afatinib followed by treatments at multiple institutions were retrospectively analyzed. All patients with progressive disease (PD) after first-line therapy underwent secondary T790M mutation detection. The secondary T790M mutation positive rate of all study patients was 57.9%. First-line erlotinib use and progression-free survival (PFS) after first-line therapy > 12 months were positively associated with the T790M mutation (P\u00a0<0.05). The response rates (RRs) to second-line treatments were 51.7% and 22.7% for the osimertinib and nonosimertinib groups, respectively (P = 0.001). The median PFS associated with second-line osimertinib and nonosimertinib therapy was 13.7 and 7.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23-0.63; P< 0.001). Patients with a secondary T790M mutation receiving second-line osimertinib treatment had a median overall survival (OS) of 54.3 months, and the median OS was 31.9 months for non-T790M-mutated patients receiving second-line nonosimertinib treatments (HR\u00a0= 0.36; CI: 0.21-0.62, P < 0.001). The majority of acquired resistance to first-line bevacizumab combined with 1st/2nd-generation EGFR-TKIs is associated with the T790M mutation. Sequential osimertinib treatment in patients with positive secondary T790M mutation is associated with better outcomes among these patients.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, drug resistance seriously impedes the clinical efficacy of gefitinib. This study investigated the repositioning of the non-oncology drug capable of inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to overcome gefitinib resistance. A few drug candidates were identified using the in silico repurposing tool \"DRUGSURV\" and tested for HDAC inhibition. Flunarizine, originally indicated for migraine prophylaxis and vertigo treatment, was selected for detailed investigation in NSCLC cell lines harboring a range of different gefitinib resistance mechanisms (EGFR T790M, KRAS G12S, MET amplification, or PTEN loss). The circumvention of gefitinib resistance by flunarizine was further demonstrated in an EGFR TKI (erlotinib)-refractory patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model in vivo. The acetylation level of cellular histone protein was increased by flunarizine in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Among the NSCLC cell lines evaluated, the extent of gefitinib resistance circumvention by flunarizine was found to be the most pronounced in EGFR T790M-bearing H1975 cells. The gefitinib-flunarizine combination was shown to induce the apoptotic protein Bim but reduce the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which apparently circumvented gefitinib resistance. The induction of Bim by flunarizine was accompanied by an increase in the histone acetylation and E2F1 interaction with the ",

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently the first-line treatment of NSCLC. However, patients inevitably acquired EGFR TKIs resistance mutations, which led to disease progression, so it is urgent to find new treatment. Here, we report that D-mannose up-regulates lysosomal activity by enhancing TFE3-mediated lysosomal biogenesis, thereby increasing the degradation of EGFR and significantly down-regulating its protein level. Therefore, D-mannose significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of wild-type EGFR (WT-EGFR) and EGFR mutant cells (E746-A750 deletion, L858R and T790M mutations) in vitro. Oral administration of D-mannose strongly inhibited tumor growth in mice, showing similar effects with osimertinib. Taken together, these data suggest that D-mannose may represent a new strategy for clinical treatment of NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "In Asians, more than half of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are induced by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Although patients carrying EGFR driver mutations display a good initial response to EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), additional mutations provoke drug resistance. Hence, predicting tumor dynamics before treatment initiation and formulating a reasonable treatment schedule is an urgent challenge. To overcome this problem, we constructed a mathematical model based on clinical observations and investigated the optimal schedules for EGFR-TKI therapy. Based on published data on cell growth rates under different drugs, we found that using osimertinib that are efficient for secondary resistant cells as the first-line drug is beneficial in monotherapy, which is consistent with published clinical statistical data. Moreover, we identified the existence of a suitable drug-switching time; that is, changing drugs too early or too late was not helpful. Furthermore, we demonstrate that osimertinib combined with erlotinib or gefitinib as first-line treatment, has the potential for clinical application. Finally, we examined the relationship between the initial ratio of resistant cells and final cell number under different treatment conditions, and summarized it into a therapy suggestion map. By performing parameter sensitivity analysis, we identified the condition where\u3000osimertinib-first therapy was recommended as the optimal treatment option. This study for the first time theoretically showed the optimal treatment strategies based on the known information in NSCLC. Our framework can be applied to other types of cancer in the future.",

In this study, we established fibroblast cell lines from the cancerous and non-cancerous parts of surgical lung specimens from patients with NSCLC and evaluated the differences in behaviors towards NSCLC cells. RNA sequencing analysis was performed to investigate the differentially expressed genes between normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs, and we identified that the expression of periostin (POSTN), which is known to be overexpressed in various solid tumors and promote cancer progression, was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs. POSTN increased cell proliferation via NSCLC cells' ERK pathway activation and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which improved migration in vitro. In addition, POSTN knockdown in CAFs suppressed these effects, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the POSTN knockdown improved the sensitivity of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells for osimertinib treatment. Collectively, our results showed that CAF-derived POSTN is involved in tumor growth, migration, EMT induction, and drug resistance in NSCLC. Targeting CAF-secreted POSTN could be a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC. KEY MESSAGES: \u2022 POSTN is significantly upregulated in CAFs compared to normal fibroblasts in NCSLC. \u2022 POSTN increases cell proliferation via activation of the NSCLC cells' ERK pathway. \u2022 POSTN induces EMT in NSCLC cells and improves the migration ability. \u2022 POSTN knockdown improves the sensitivity for osimertinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has overcome the acquired resistance of first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs due to the EGFR T790M mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, acquired resistance to osimertinib remains a significant clinical challenge. Luteolin, a natural flavonoid from traditional Chinese medicine, has exerted antitumor effects in various tumors. In this study, we investigated whether the natural flavonoid luteolin can enhance the antitumor effects of osimertinib in NSCLC cells. We established an acquired osimertinib-resistant cell line, H1975/OR, and evaluated the effects of luteolin and osimertinib alone and in combination on proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of H1975/OR cells. The potential mechanisms by which the combination of luteolin and osimertinib exert their effects were investigated by PCR, western blot, gene silencing, molecular docking, SPR and kinase activity analysis. The combination of luteolin and osimertinib inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of H1975/OR cells and promoted apoptosis. We identified mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) amplification and overactivation as important resistance mechanisms of H1975/OR cells. The combination downregulated the gene and protein expression of MET and inhibited its protein phosphorylation, thereby blocking the activation of the downstream Akt pathway. Additionally, the mediated effects of MET on the synergistic effect of luteolin and osimertinib were confirmed by silencing of MET. Luteolin strongly bound with nonphosphorylated MET by occupying the active pocket of MET and inhibiting its activation. Notably, the combination also downregulated the expression of autocrine hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the sole ligand of MET. In conclusion, luteolin can synergize with osimertinib to overcome MET amplification and overactivation-induced acquired resistance to osimertinib by suppressing the HGF-MET-Akt pathway, suggesting the clinical potential of combining luteolin with osimertinib in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance.",

A retrospective study involving 72 advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastases at the Vietnam National Cancer Hospital were conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups: EGFR-TKI (erlotinib) monotherapy and EGFR-TKI combined with locoregional therapy (\u03b3 knife surgery - GKS or whole-brain radiation therapy). Evaluation criteria included clinical and laboratory characteristics, central nervous system (CNS) progression time, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), T790M mutation rate, and adverse events. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy patients had better performance status (PS), fewer CNS symptoms, and significantly fewer brain metastases ( Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, with or without locoregional therapy, is effective for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastases.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy is used to treat EGFR mutation-induced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its efficacy does not last beyond a certain period due to the development of primary and secondary resistance. First and second-generation inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) induce EGFR T790M mutations, while third-generation inhibitors (e.g., osimertinib) induce C797S as a major target resistance mutation. Therefore, the C797S mutation is being actively researched. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationship of several synthesized compounds as fourth-generation inhibitors against the C797S mutation. We identified a compound 13k that displayed nanomolar potency and high selectivity. Moreover, we used a triple mutant xenograft mouse model to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of 13k in inhibiting EGFR C797S, which demonstrated exceptional profiles and satisfactory EGFR C797S inhibition efficacy. Based on its excellent in vitro and in vivo profiles, compound 13k can be considered a promising candidate for treating EGFR C797S mutations.",

    "abstract": "The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been implicated in tumorigenesis, whereas epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a vital role in lung cancer progression. Both RAGE and EGFR are transmembrane receptors that transmit intracellular signals through ligand binding, and their downstream signaling cascades show substantial overlap. However, the interplay between these two molecules remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the correlation between RAGE and EGFR in the tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and evaluated the impact of RAGE on the response of NSCLC cells to gefitinib, an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The expression and activation of EGFR and the phosphorylation of its downstream molecules, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), were increased in RAGE-overexpressed A549 (A549-RAGE) cells. Notably, ligand-triggered activation of EGFR signaling was significantly greater in A549-RAGE compared with A549-parental cells. In addition, gefitinib had less effect on the inhibition of EGFR signaling in A549-RAGE cells. These findings were validated in other NSCLC cell lines, H1299 and H1975. Furthermore, upon gefitinib administration, the antiapoptotic marker B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression was upregulated in A549-RAGE cells, whereas the apoptotic markers Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 interacting mediator (Bim) remained at lower levels compared with A549-parental cells. Importantly, our findings provide evidence that RAGE interferes with the anticancer effect of gefitinib by modulating the activation of EGFR-STAT3 and EGFR-Erk pathways. Overall, these significant findings deepen our understanding of the intricate relationship between RAGE and EGFR signaling in NSCLC tumorigenesis and provide new considerations for the clinical treatment of NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib, are effective in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations. However, the mechanism underlying acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs remains largely unknown. Therefore, the present study generated gefitinib-resistant PC-9 (PC-9G) cells, which were revealed to be more resistant to gefitinib-induced reductions in proliferation, migration and invasion, and increases in apoptosis, and had no detectable EGFR mutations compared with the control PC-9 cell line. In addition, the present study performed genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes between PC-9 and PC-9G cell lines. Cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, migration and flow cytometry analyses were also performed. The genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) was downregulated in PC-9G cells compared with that in PC-9 cells. Furthermore, GSK3\u03b2 overexpression increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of PC-9 and H1975 gefitinib-resistant cells. Conversely, overexpression of GSK3\u03b2 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of PC-9G cells. Furthermore, AKT inhibition reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced the apoptosis of PC-9, PC-9G and H1975 cells, the effects of which were reversed following AKT activation; notably, the tumor suppressor function of GSK3\u03b2 was inconsistent with the tumor promotor role of the AKT pathway in PC-9G cells without EGFR mutation. The present study may provide novel insights into the distinctive role of GSK3\u03b2 in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC with or without EGFR mutations, suggesting that a more detailed investigation on GSK3\u03b2 as a therapeutic target for gefitinib-resistant NSCLC may be warranted.",

    "abstract": "Despite the well-established efficacies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is limited real-world evidence comparing their effectiveness according to patients' clinical characteristics. This network meta-analysis (NMA) compared survival outcomes among first-line EGFR-TKIs in different subgroups of East Asian patients with advanced NSCLC. This NMA included real-world observational studies reporting outcomes with TKIs in patients aged >65\u2009years, with baseline brain metastasis, with different Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) statuses, or with different common EGFR mutation types. In patients with the EGFR L858R mutation, afatinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR]:\u20090.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]:\u20090.46-0.75) and gefitinib (HR:\u20090.41, 95% CI:\u20090.32-0.53). Similarly, in patients with the EGFR Del19 mutation, afatinib and erlotinib resulted in significantly longer PFS than gefitinib (HR:\u20090.48 with 95% CI:\u20090.33-0.71 and HR:\u20090.54 with 95% CI:\u20090.36-0.80, respectively). Moreover, afatinib resulted in significantly longer PFS than gefitinib in patients with brain metastasis (HR:\u20090.53, 95% CI:\u20090.33-0.87) or ECOG status 0-1 (HR:\u20090.37, 95% CI:\u20090.23-0.59). This NMA suggests that afatinib results in similar PFS to erlotinib and superior PFS than gefitinib in patients with Del19 mutant NSCLC, aged \u226565\u2009years, with ECOG scores of 0-1, and with baseline brain metastasis.",

    "abstract": "CAGE, a cancer/testis antigen, was originally isolated from the sera of patients with gastric cancers. Previously, we have shown the role of CAGE in resistance to chemotherapy and target therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CAGE in osimertinib resistance and determine the prognostic value of CAGE in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The clinicopathological correlation with CAGE and autophagy flux in patients was examined using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The possible role of autophagy in osimertinib resistance was analyzed using immune blot, immune fluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry. This study found that immunohistochemical staining (IHC) showed CAGE expression in more than 50% of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas (pADCs). CAGE expression was increased in pADCs after the acquisition of EGFR-TKIs resistance. High expression of CAGE was correlated with shorter overall survival and progression free survival in patients with pADCs. Thus, CAGE mediates osimertinib resistance and predicts poor prognosis in patients with pADCs. Osimertinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (PC-9/OSI) were established and mechanistic studies of CAGE-mediated osimertinib resistance were performed. PC-9/OSI cells showed increased autophagic flux and CAGE expression compared with parental sensitive PC-9 cells. PC-9/OSI cells showed higher tumorigenic, metastatic, and angiogenic potential compared with parental PC-9 cells. CAGE CRISPR-Cas9 cell lines showed decreased autophagic flux, invasion, migration potential, and tumorigenic potential compared with PC-9/OSI cells in vitro and in vivo. CAGE plays a crucial role in the cancer progression by modulating autophagy and can predict the poor prognosis of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Our findings propose CAGE as a potential therapeutic target for developing anticancer drugs that can overcome osimertinib resistance.",

However, first-generation EGFR-TKIs may provide only modest pathological response in the majority of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Here, we present a case of EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma in which a pathological complete response was revealed in histological specimens obtained during conversion surgery following systemic treatment using a third-generation EGFR-TKI. A 61-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital for salvage surgery. Four months prior to the admission, he had been diagnosed with unresectable adenocarcinoma (clinical stage IIIA/T4N1MO) originating from the right lower lobe. Chest computed tomography had revealed a 3.4-cm tumor and enlarged hilar nodes that invaded into the left atrium through the lower pulmonary vein. An activating EGFR-mutation (L858R) had been detected in the tumor specimen. Osimertinib monotherapy had provided a dramatic radiographic response. The patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable disease after 4\u00a0months' osimertinib treatment and was referred to our hospital. Complete resection with right lower lobectomy and combined resection of the left atrium was achieved. Pathological examination showed no viable tumor cells in the resected specimens. Postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is alive without tumor recurrence at 2\u00a0years after surgery. Pathological complete response was achieved with systemic treatment with osimertinib prior to surgery. Conversion surgery after osimertinib treatment may be safe and effective for NSCLC harboring activating EGFR-mutations.",

Due to the involvement of EGFR in these biological processes, it becomes a most potent target for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have endorsed high efficacy and anticipation to patients but unfortunately, within a year of treatment, drug targets develop resistance due to mutations. The present study detected the compensatory mutations in EGFR to know the evolutionary mechanism of drug resistance. The results of this study demonstrate that compensatory mutations enlarge the drug-binding pocket which may lead to the altered orientation of the ligand (gefitinib and erlotinib) causing drug resistance. This indicates that coevolutionary forces play a significant role in fine-tuning the structure of EGFR protein against the drugs. The analysis provides insight into the evolution-induced structural aspects of drug resistance changes in EGFR which in turn be useful in designing drugs with better efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib, an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), frequently causes side effects when used to treat non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the side effect of gefitinib on the skin and colon of mice. Male Balb/c nu-nu nude mice aged 4-5 weeks were used as xenograft tumor models, and gefitinib at 150 mg/kg and 225 mg/kg was started at 9 days after the xenograft tumor grew out. The mice's weights and tumor volumes were tracked concurrently, and the mouse skin adverse reactions and diarrhea were observed during the treatment. The animal tissues were subjected to biochemical and pathological evaluations after 14 days. Gefitinib effectively decreased the size and weight of transplanted tumors in nude mice, while also lowering body weight and raising indexes of the liver and spleen. Gefitinib could cause skin adverse reactions and diarrhea in mice. Further pathological investigation revealed tight junction- related markers in the mice's skin and colon to be reduced and macrophages and neutrophils to be increased after gefitinib treatment. The findings imply that gefitinib has negative effects on the skin and colon. Gefitinib- induced skin and colon adverse reactions in mice have been successfully modeled in this study.",

    "title": "Treatment-Related Pneumonitis of EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Plus Thoracic Radiation Therapy in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic radiation therapy (RT) for non-small cell lung cancers may overcome resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the risk of severe treatment-related pneumonitis (TRP) is a major concern, and the results of the combined treatment remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review existing publications and provide a meta-analysis of TRP from a combined therapy of thoracic RT and TKIs. A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed-MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify eligible publications. The number of severe TRP cases of grade 3 or higher was extracted and then analyzed by fixed or randomized model meta-analysis. Heterogeneity tests were performed using the I\u00b2 and \u03c4\u00b2 statistics. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the types of RT and the sequence of the combined treatment. Our literature search identified 37 eligible studies with 1143 patients. Severe TRP occurred in 3.8% (95% CI, 1.8%-6.5%) of patients overall, and fatal pneumonitis occurred rarely in 0.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.3%). In the subgroup analysis, the severe TRP proportion was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-4.1%) for patients under definitive (chemo)RT (19 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0702) versus 2.9% (95% CI, 1.3%-5.1%) for patients who received local stereotactic body RT or palliative RT (15 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0361). The severe TRP rate was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.4%-8.1%) for concurrent TKI and RT (26 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0765), which was significantly higher than TRP of 0.4% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.1%) for sequential therapy (6 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0200). Our meta-analysis showed that combined thoracic RT and epidermal growth factor receptor-TKI therapy has an acceptable risk of severe TRP and rare mortality in patients with non-small cell lung cancers. Concurrent treatment is less tolerable and should be administered with caution. Further investigations using osimertinib are required as the data on its effects are limited.",

    "abstract": "A few researches have reported the exposure-efficacy/toxicity relationships of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). On account of the large interpatient pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) seems promising for optimizing dosage regimen and improving treatment efficacy and safety. Therefore, a rapid and convenient ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of icotinib, osimertinib, gefitinib and O-demesthyl gefitinib in human plasma for TDM. Icotinib-D This analytical method was fully validated with selectivity, carry-over, linearity, lower limit of quantification, accuracy (from 92.68% to 106.62%) and precision (intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation ranged from 0.92% to 9.85%), matrix effect, extraction recovery, stability and dilution integrity. The calibration curves were developed to be within the concentration ranges of 200-4000\u00a0ng/mL for icotinib, 50-1000\u00a0ng/mL for osimertinib, gefitinib and O-desmethyl gefitinib in human plasma which meet the needs of routine TDM. The proposed method was used in 100 patients with non-small cell lung cancer for monitoring plasma concentration of the mentioned EGFR-TKIs. The trough concentrations of ICO were distributed between 226.42\u00a0ng/mL and 3853.36\u00a0ng/mL, peak concentrations were between 609.20\u00a0ng/mL and 2191.54\u00a0ng/mL. The trough concentrations of OSI were distributed between 110.48\u00a0ng/mL and 1183.13\u00a0ng/mL. The trough concentrations of GEF were distributed between 117.71\u00a0ng/mL and 582.74\u00a0ng/mL, while DeGEF was distributed from 76.21\u00a0ng/mL to 1939.83\u00a0ng/mL with two less than 20\u00a0ng/mL. The results of therapeutic drug monitoring aimed to investigate exposure-efficacy/toxicity relationship and improve the efficacy and safety of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often develop resistance to current standard third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); no targeted treatments are approved in the osimertinib-relapsed setting. In this open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1 trial, the potential for improved anti-tumor activity by combining amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, with lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, was evaluated in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC whose disease progressed on third-generation TKI monotherapy but were chemotherapy naive (CHRYSALIS cohort E). In the dose-escalation phase, the recommended phase 2 combination dose was established; in the dose-expansion phase, the primary endpoints were safety and overall response rate, and key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and overall survival. The safety profile of amivantamab and lazertinib was generally consistent with previous experience of each agent alone, with 4% experiencing grade \u22653 events; no new safety signals were identified. In an exploratory cohort of 45 patients who were enrolled without biomarker selection, the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed overall response rate was 36% (95% confidence interval, 22-51). The median duration of response was 9.6\u2009months, and the median progression-free survival was 4.9\u2009months. Next-generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry analyses identified high EGFR and/or MET expression as potential predictive biomarkers of response, which will need to be validated with prospective assessment.

    "abstract": "The comparative efficacies of different generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. Moreover, whether one EGFR-TKI confers superior survival remains unclear, especially in East Asians. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the survival outcomes of East Asian patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs. The NMA included observational real-world evidence studies on adult patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC who received first (gefitinib and erlotinib), second (afatinib), or third (osimertinib) generation EGFR-TKIs as frontline therapy. Studies were identified through an online bibliographic search of Medline articles in the PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. For overall survival (OS), afatinib had significantly better hazard ratios (HRs) than osimertinib (HR:\u20090.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]:\u20090.23-0.91), gefitinib (HR:\u20090.56, 95% CI:\u20090.43-0.72), and erlotinib (HR:\u20090.71, 95% CI:\u20090.54-0.92). For progression-free survival (PFS), afatinib had significantly better HRs than gefitinib (HR:\u20090.45, 95% CI:\u20090.36-0.56) and erlotinib (HR:\u20090.63, 95% CI:\u20090.49-0.81). Moreover, afatinib was most likely to achieve the longest OS (81.3%), followed by erlotinib (13%), osimertinib, and gefitinib. Furthermore, afatinib was most likely to achieve the longest PFS (48.3%), followed by osimertinib (34.9%) and erlotinib. This real-world evidence shows that afatinib confers better survival than other first-line EGFR-TKIs in East Asian patients with advanced NSCLC.",

To develop and validate a multisequence MRI-based radiomics nomogram for early prediction of osimertinib resistance in NSCLC with brain metastases (BM). Pretreatment brain MRI of 251 NSCLC patients proven with BM were retrospectively enrolled from two centers (training cohort:\u00a0196 patients; testing cohort: 55 patients). According to the gene test result of osimertinib resistance, patients were labeled as resistance and non-resistance groups (training cohort: 65 versus 131 patients; testing cohort: 25 versus 30 patients). Radiomics features were extracted from T2WI, T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1-CE) sequences separately and radiomics score (rad-score) were built from the four sequences. Then a multisequence MRI-based nomogram was developed and the predictive ability was evaluated by ROC curves and calibration curves. The rad-scores of the four sequences has significant differences between resistance and non-resistance groups in both training and testing cohorts. The nomogram achieved the highest predictive ability with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.989 (95 % confidence interval, 0.976-1.000) and 0.923 (95 % confidence interval, 0.851-0.995) in the training and testing cohort respectively. The calibration curves showed excellent concordance between the predicted and actual probability of osimertinib resistance using the radiomics nomogram. The multisequence MRI-based radiomics nomogram can be used as a noninvasive auxiliary tool to identify candidates who were resistant to osimertinib, which could guide clinical therapy for NSCLC patients with BM.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is a risk factor associated with brain metastases (BMs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of osimertinib early dose reduction on BM worsening. We retrospectively analyzed EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib as first-line treatment between August 2018 and October 2021. To evaluate the impact of osimertinib early dose reduction, we performed a landmark analysis of patients who achieved disease control at 4\u2009months. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether the osimertinib dose was reduced or not, within 4\u2009months after the start of treatment. We evaluated the time to BMs onset or progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival. In total, 62 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations were analyzed. Thirteen patients experienced early dose reduction of osimertinib treatment. Seven patients received osimertinib 40\u2009mg daily, and six received 80\u2009mg every other day. The most common reason for dose reduction was gastrointestinal toxicity (n\u2009=\u20094), followed by skin rashes (n\u2009=\u20093). The time to BMs onset or progression was significantly shorter in patients who experienced early dose reduction than in those who continued regular treatment (Hazard ratio 4.47, 95% confidence interval, 1.52-13.11). The 1-year cumulative incidence of BM onset or progression was 23.1% in the reduced-dose group and 5.0% in the standard dose group. The risk of worsening BMs with early dose reduction of osimertinib treatment was higher in patients who had BMs before treatment and in younger patients. Early dose reduction of osimertinib was a risk factor for the worsening of BMs. A higher risk was associated with younger patients and those presenting BMs before treatment.",

In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, RPA, exon 19 deletion, and osimertinib treatment were significant predictors of overall survival. The cumulative incidence of neurological death at 2 and 4\u00a0years post initial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was 8% and 11%, respectively, and correlated with LMD. The study shows that current-generation targeted therapy for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients may prevent the development and progression of LMD, leading to improved survival outcomes.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib was first approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have developed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation after treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We routinely evaluated the plasma of NSCLC patients with the T790M mutation to more rapidly detect an increase in disease activity and resistance to treatment. Eligible patients received osimertinib after resistance to the first- or second-generation of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC harboring T790M mutation detectable in tumor tissue or plasma. Plasma samples were collected every 8 weeks during osimertinib treatment. The plasma analysis was performed using an improved PNA-LNA PCR clamp method. We tested samples for a resistance mechanism, including EGFR-activating, T790M, and C797S mutations, and assessed the association between the mutations and osimertinib treatment. Of the 60 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were eligible for this analysis. In plasma collected before osimertinib treatment, activating mutations were detected in 47 of 58 patients (81.0%) and T790M was detected in 44 patients (75.9%). Activating mutations were cleared in 60.9% (28/46) and T790M was cleared in 93.0% (40/43). Of these, 71.4% (20/28) of activating mutations and 87.5% (35/40) of T790M mutation were cleared within 8 weeks of treatment. The total response rate (RR) was 53.4% (31/58). The median duration of treatment was 259 days, with a trend toward longer treatment duration in patients who experienced the clearance of activating mutations with osimertinib. At the time of disease progression during osimertinib treatment, C797S was detected in 3 of 37 patients (8.1%). Plasma EGFR mutation analysis was effective in predicting the effect of osimertinib treatment.",

OBR can be misunderstood as disease progression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and details of OBR and its association with clinical outcomes in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with osimertinib. This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We reviewed patients who were diagnosed with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with bone metastasis and received osimertinib as a first-line treatment between February 2018 and October 2022. The OBR was evaluated by comparing baseline computed tomography (CT) scans with the first CT scan after treatment initiation. A total of 45 patients were included in this study. Thirty-seven patients (82%) developed OBR. OBR developed in 94% (n\u2009=\u200916) of patients with sclerotic bone lesions (n\u2009=\u200917) at baseline. Similarly, OBR developed in lytic and mixed bone lesions in 76% and 82% of patients with lytic and mixed lesions, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) did not differ significantly between patients with (OBR group) and without OBR (non-OBR group) (median PFS, 24\u00a0months vs. 17\u00a0months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.62; 95% CI, 0.24-1.6; p\u2009=\u20090.31).

Multivariate analysis showed OBR was a significant independent predictor of SRE-FS (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13-0.92; p\u2009=\u20090.034). OBR developed in most patients with NSCLC and bone metastasis who received osimertinib treatment. The increased incidence of OBR in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with bone metastasis treated with osimertinib should not be confused with disease progression, and treatment decisions should be made carefully.",

However, for the rare EGFR deletion-insertion mutation of exon 18, there is very little evidence regarding the effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A particular challenge for clinicians in applying tyrosine kinase inhibitors is not only diagnosing a mutation but also interpreting rare mutations with unclear therapeutic significance. Thus, we present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian male lung adenocarcinoma patient with an EGFR Exon 18 p.Glu709_Thr710delinsAsp mutation of uncertain therapeutic relevance. This patient initially received two cycles of standard platinum-based chemotherapy without any therapeutic response. After administration of Osimertinib as second line therapy, the patient showed a lasting partial remission for 12 months. Therapy related toxicities were limited to mild thrombocytopenia, which ceased after dose reduction of Osimertinib. To our knowledge, this is the first report of effective treatment of this particular mutation with Osimertinib. Hence, we would like to discuss Osimertinib as a viable treatment option in EGFR Exon 18 p.Glu709_Thr710delinsAsp mutated lung adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of targeted therapies, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors have become the preferred initial treatment for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is effective against exon 19 and 21 mutations as well as the T790M mutation. It has been approved by both the food and drug administration and European Medicines Agency for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated tumors, including those who have acquired T790M mutations. To evaluate the effectiveness of osimertinib in treating patients with EGFR-mutated advanced lung adenocarcinoma and bone metastases, we present the treatment outcomes of 3 patients with EGFR 19 deletion-mutated advanced lung adenocarcinoma and bone metastases who received osimertinib treatment in recent years. All 3 cases involved elderly female patients, aged 62, 62, and 54, respectively. All 3 cases exhibited a diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma accompanied by osseous metastases, with genetic testing revealing the presence of an EGFR 19del mutation. In the first case, following 17 months of gefitinib therapy, disease progression prompted a switch to osimertinib treatment. In the second case, bone metastases were detected after 20 months of pemetrexed-carboplatin chemotherapy, leading to a transition to osimertinib therapy. In the third case, after 11 months of erlotinib treatment, bone metastases were identified. Subsequent interventions, including radiation therapy, pemetrexed-carboplatin chemotherapy, pemetrexed-bevacizumab maintenance therapy, and docetaxel chemotherapy, failed to arrest the progression of bone metastases. As a result, a combination of osimertinib and anlotinib targeted therapy was administered. All 3 patients experienced relatively good and favorable survival outcomes, with a progression-free survival of 22.7 months, 12 months, and 17.7 months, respectively. These cases suggest that osimertinib is a promising treatment option for patients with EGFR 19 deletion-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and bone metastases, although further clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.",

This study investigates the combined use of EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or osimertinib) with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to overcome acquired drug resistance in NSCLC models. The in vitro antiproliferative effects of EGFR-TKIs and EGCG combination in EGFR-mutant parental and resistant cell lines were evaluated. The in vivo efficacy of the combination was assessed in xenograft mouse models derived from EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells. We found that the combined use of EGFR-TKIs and EGCG significantly reversed the Warburg effect by suppressing glycolysis while boosting mitochondrial respiration, which was accompanied by increased cellular ROS and decreased lactate secretion. The combination effectively activated the AMPK pathway while inhibited both ERK/MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, particularly in drug-resistant NSCLC cells. The in vivo results obtained from mouse tumor xenograft model confirmed that EGCG effectively overcame osimertinib resistance. This study revealed that EGCG suppressed cancer bypass survival signaling and altered cancer metabolic profiles, which is a promising anticancer adjuvant of EGFR-TKIs to overcome acquired drug resistance in NSCLC.",

In addition, the clinical significance of first-generation (1G) or second-generation (2G) EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and osimertinib resistance has not yet been fully evaluated. We aimed to conduct a prospective multicenter observational study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1G and 2G EGFR-TKIs after the development of osimertinib resistance. Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received 1G or 2G EGFR-TKIs after developing resistance to osimertinib monotherapy were prospectively assessed at eight institutions in Japan. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 29 patients with advanced or recurrent EGFR-mutant NSCLC were analyzed. The objective response and disease control rates were 6.9% (2/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively. The median PFS was 1.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-5.3]. There was no significant difference in PFS between the 1G and 2G EGFR-TKI groups (3.7 versus 1.5 months, log-rank test p = 0.20).

VEGFR2 and VEGF-C were highly expressed in 65.8% and 51.3% of patients, respectively, in the Osi group, and 69.7% and 76.7%, respectively, in the control group. High VEGFR2 and VEGF-C levels were significantly associated with poor performance status (PS) and female sex, respectively. In the Osi group, patients with co-high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGF-C showed significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those without co-high expression. In del19, VEGFR2 was a significant predictor of PFS and OS and independent predictor of OS in multivariate analysis. In L858R, co-high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGF-C was identified as a significant predictor of PFS and OS and independent predictor of PFS. VEGFR2 and VEGF-C are highly expressed in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Increased expression of VEGFR2 was identified as a significant prognostic factor in patients with EGFR del19 mutation who received osimertinib, whereas co-high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGF-C was a significant predictor for those with EGFR L858R mutation.",

This ongoing clinical trial is to investigate the secondary chemoprevention effect of osimertinib from CNS with platinum doublets chemotherapy in patients who had progressive disease outside of CNS lesions. The aim of this randomized, phase II trial is to evaluate platinum and pemetrexed chemotherapy followed by pemetrexed maintenance with or without continuation of osimertinib for secondary CNS prevention in patients with brain metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation, with other than CNS lesions, but no progressive disease in the CNS lesion after osimertinib. The primary end point is to assess progression-free survival by investigator assessment. The key secondary end points are overall survival, response rate, time to CNS controlling, time to whole-brain irradiation and safety.  The authors are conducting a clinical trial aimed at improving treatment for individuals diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer, a specific type of lung cancer. In some cases, this cancer can spread to the brain. This study focuses on patients whose cancer is stable in the brain but progressing in other parts of the body. The study is comparing two different treatment approaches. One involves a combination of two drugs, platinum and pemetrexed, while the other combines these drugs with a third one called osimertinib. The main objective is to determine if continuing osimertinib treatment benefits these patients. The authors are evaluating the time it takes for the cancer to start growing again, known as progression-free survival, to identify the most effective treatment. Progression-free survival represents the duration that patients live without their disease worsening. This study, the EPONA study, will provide valuable insights into optimizing the treatment of this type of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Docetaxel is an established standard therapy after osimertinib and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (Pt-doublet) for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation. To facilitate future therapeutic developments in these patients after treatment with osimertinib and Pt-doublet, we estimated the outcomes of currently used post-treatment therapies. Data of patients with NSCLC who received at least one medication after osimertinib and Pt-doublet between April 2008 and August 2021 were extracted from the Medical Data Vision claims database. The duration of treatment (DoT) (first treatment after osimertinib and Pt-doublet) and overall survival (OS) were estimated. The index date was the first day on which the medication was prescribed. In total, 731 patients (mean age 64\u00a0years) were screened. The most frequent post-treatments were docetaxel-based chemotherapy (30.2%), immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) alone or in combination (17.2%), first-/second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (16.7%), osimertinib (16.3%), and Pt-doublet (5.2%). The median DoT and OS (95% confidence interval) of all post-treatments were 3.5 (3.27, 3.77) and 10.3 (9.3, 12.1) months, respectively, reflecting the median DoT (3.8\u00a0months) and OS (10.0\u00a0months) of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Among all post-treatment regimens, ICIs resulted numerically the shortest [2.77 (2.33, 3.00) months] and osimertinib the longest [4.40 (3.47, 5.67) months] median DoT. The median OS was shortest in patients post-treated with ICIs [7.07 (5.40, 9.90) months] and longest in patients rechallenged with Pt-doublet (12.27\u00a0months), followed by patients post-treated with osimertinib (11.70\u00a0months). In a subset analysis of patients who received first-line osimertinib and second-line Pt-doublet as well as Pt-doublet immediately after osimertinib, those post-treated with ICIs had the shortest median DoT. Given the limited real-world efficacy on EGFR-mutant NSCLC resistant to osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy, the development of more highly potent post-treatment therapies is warranted.",

But the cardiac adverse events (AEs) related to the EGFR-TKI treatment occur frequently. And the cases of TKI-associated cardiac AEs remain poorly understood. In order to study the effects of EGFR-TKIs on cardiomyocytes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure and analyze the physical properties of cardiomyocytes under the actions of three drugs (gefitinib, afatinib and osimertinib) with different concentrations. By comparing the height, adhesion, Young's modulus, the amplitude and the time of the contraction and relaxation process, it was found that the changes of the mechanical properties of cells were well correlated with the symptoms of AEs, such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, QT prolongation, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction reductions, and cardiac failure. In addition, osimertinib has the most obvious effect on cardiomyocytes at a low concentration, and gefitinib has the greatest effect with the increase of concentration, while afatinib has the least effect on cardiomyocytes. This provides a new method for screening drugs and exploring the principle of action in the process of cancer treatment at the cellular level.",

In this real-world study, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) for resected stage IB lung adenocarcinoma. This real-world study recruited 249 patients diagnosed with stage IB disease after surgical resection between January 2013 and September 2021. Sixty-six (26.5%) patients received adjuvant targeted therapy (TKIs group), and 183 (73.5%) were enrolled in the clinical observation (CO) group. Propensity scores were matched to minimize the observed confounder effects between the two groups, and 59 patient pairs were matched. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). In the TKI group, 38 (64.4%) patients chose to receive icotinib, 27.1% (16/59) received gefitinib, and 5 patients (8.5%) chose osimertinib. The median follow-up time was 30.8\u2009months (range: 7-107\u2009months). Two (3.4%) patients in the TKI group and 10 (16.9%) in the CO group experienced disease relapse. The 3-year DFS rates were 98.3% in the TKI group and 83.0% in the CO group (HR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01-0.78; p\u2009=\u20090.008). DFS differences were found in the entire cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and the matched cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.024) between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that adjuvant EGFR-TKIs was an independent factor for DFS (HR: 0.211; 95% CI: 0.045-0.979; p\u2009=\u20090.047), along with poor cell differentiation (HR: 5.256; 95% CI: 1.648-16.769; p\u2009=\u20090.005), and spread through air spaces (HR: 5.612; 95% CI: 1.137-27.700; p\u2009=\u20090.034). None of the patients discontinued EGFR-TKIs owing to the low occurrence rate of treatment-related serious adverse events. Adjuvant EGFR-TKIs could significantly improve DFS among patients with stage IB lung adenocarcinoma compared with CO, with a safe and tolerable profile.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation often obtain de novo resistance or develop secondary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), which restricts the clinical benefit for the patients. The activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signal pathway is one of the most important mechanisms for the EGFR-TKIs resistance beyond T790M mutation. There are currently no drugs simultaneously targeting EGFR and PI3K signal pathways, and combination of these two pathway inhibitors may be a possible strategy to reverse theses resistances. To test whether this combinational strategy works, we investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of combining BYL719, a PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor, with gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI inhibitor in EGFR-TKIs resistance NSCLC models induced by PI3K/AKT activation. Our results demonstrated that PIK3CA mutated cells showed increased growth rate and less sensitive or even resistant to gefitinib, associated with increased PI3K/AKT expression. The combination of BYL719 and gefitinib resulted in synergistic effect compared with the single agents alone in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells with PI3K/AKT activation. The inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by BYL719 increased the antitumor efficacy of gefitinib in these cell lines. Moreover, the combined effect and mechanism of gefitinib and BYL719 were also confirmed in the NSCLC cells and patient-derived organoids under 3D culture condition, as well as in vivo. Taken together, the data indicate that PIK3CA mutation induces more aggressive growth and gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells, and the combination treatment with gefitinib and BYL719 is a promising therapeutic approach to overcoming EGFR-TKIs resistance induced by PI3K/AKT activation.",

A comprehensive literature search for published and unpublished studies was implemented in April 2021 of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and several international conference databases, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to calculate the pooled rate of overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), one-year overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).

Metronomic oral vinorelbine is an effective treatment with less toxicity for advanced NSCLC. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of osimertinib plus metronomic oral vinorelbine on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant advanced NSCLC beyond limited progression on osimertinib. We have reviewed the medical records of 28 patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC who had received osimertinib continuation plus metronomic oral vinorelbine beyond limited progression on osimertinib. We also evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics of enrolled patients, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the treatment. After a median follow-up period of 14.1 months, 57.1% (16/28) of cases showed NSCLC progression. The median progression-free survival (PFS) period under osimertinib plus metronomic oral vinorelbine was 9.4 months (95% confidence interval, 1.562-17.238 months), with a disease control rate of 89.3% and objective response rate of 17.9%. PFS did not differ between patients who had previously received osimertinib as first- (n = 16) and second-line (n = 12) therapy (median, 11.4 and 4.7 months, P = 0.391). In addition, the median PFS duration did not differ according to the efficacy (PFS2 \u2265 6 months vs. <6 months) of previous osimertinib monotherapy (median, 5.8 and 9.4 months, P = 0.677).

    "abstract": "To determine the role and rational application of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) adjuvant therapy in patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the survival outcomes between adjuvant EGFR-TKIs and adjuvant chemotherapy or a placebo, or between different EGFR-TKI treatment durations for resected NSCLC, were eligible for inclusion. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as effective measures using random-effect or fixed-effect models. Subgroup analysis was also performed. Eleven RCTs involving 2102 EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with or without EGFR-TKI adjuvant therapy were included. For all stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients, EGFR-TKIs adjuvant therapy could not only significantly improve DFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30-0.63, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 2- and 3-year DFS rates, but also improve OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54-0.96, P\u2009=\u20090.024), compared with chemotherapy or the placebo. Further subgroup analyses indicated prolonged OS from first-generation EGFR-TKI adjuvant therapy in stage III patients, compared with chemotherapy or the placebo (HR for OS, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.63; P\u2009=\u20090.001). Of note, osimertinib adjuvant therapy led to the OS benefit expanding from stage III to stage II-III patients, with significantly improved DFS and a lower risk of brain recurrence, compared with the placebo. A 2-year treatment duration with EGFR-TKI adjuvant therapy showed a significantly lower recurrence risk than a\u2009\u2264\u20091-year duration. The DFS advantage from first-generation EGFR-TKI adjuvant therapy can translate into an OS benefit in stage III NSCLC patients. Osimertinib might be more suitable for adjuvant therapy than first-generation EGFR-TKIs, because of the lower recurrence rate and the potential OS benefit even in early-stage patients. The optimal treatment duration for EGFR-TKIs at different stages of disease needs to be validated.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are devastating complications of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has better penetration into the central nervous system than first-generation EGFR-TKIs, data on the distinct activity of EGFR-TKIs in untreated advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC with LM are lacking. We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with EGFR-TKIs for TKI-untreated common EGFR-mutated NSCLC with LM between July 2002 and July 2021 at the National Cancer Center Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: patients treated with osimertinib (Osi group) and those treated with gefitinib or erlotinib [first-generation (1G)-TKI group]. Of the 967 patients, 71 were eligible, including 29 in the Osi group and 42 in the 1G-TKI group. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the Osi group were better than those in the 1G-TKI group (PFS: 16.9 months versus 8.6 months, P\u00a0= 0.007, and OS: 26.6 months versus 20.0 months, P\u00a0= 0.158). The LM-overall response rate (ORR) and LM-PFS were significantly better in the Osi group than in the 1G-TKI group (LM-ORR: 62.5% versus 25.7%, P\u00a0= 0.007; LM-PFS: 23.4 months versus 12.1 months, P\u00a0= 0.021). In the subgroup analysis of EGFR mutation status, LM-PFS for patients with exon 19 deletion was significantly longer in the Osi group than in the 1G-TKI group (32.7 months versus 13.4 months, P\u00a0= 0.013), whereas those with L858R mutation in exon 21 did not differ between the two groups. In the multivariate analysis, osimertinib and exon 19 deletion were significant factors for better LM-PFS and OS. Osimertinib can be more effective for untreated common EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with LM, especially those with exon 19 deletion, compared to first-generation TKIs.",

Evaluate the therapeutic effect of TKI joint and Osimertinib drug therapy for positive patients with gene positive. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were searched through electronic databases. treatment emergent adverse events were summarized, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Appropriate networks for different outcomes were created to incorporate all the evidence. Bayesian network-based multitreatment was used to compare the efficacy and specific toxicity of all treatment regimens. Fourteen eligible studies involving 2325 patients were included. Of these, 7 studies compared EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy with EGFR-TKI alone, and 6 studies compared EGFR-TKI plus antiangiogenic therapy with EGFR-TKI alone. One study compared Osimertinib and GP, ER, EB, and GCP were more effective than SOC in PFS analysis; however, there was no significant difference between osimertinib and the other 4 combination regimens. The cumulative probabilities of being the most efficacious treatments were (PFS, OS, treatment emergent adverse events): O (73%, 16%, 0%, 0%), GCP (14%, 64%, 10%, 16%), GP (2%, 17%,8%), and EB (3%, 3%, 8%), ER (5%, NA, 4%);GA(1%, NA, 69%).

    "abstract": "Secondary mutation, T790M, conferring tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance beyond oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations presents a challenging unmet need. Although TKI-resistant mechanisms are intensively investigated, the underlying responses of cancer cells adapting drug perturbation are largely unknown. To illuminate the molecular basis linking acquired mutation to TKI resistance, affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry was adopted to dissect EGFR interactome in TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells. The analysis revealed TKI-resistant EGFR-mutant interactome allocated in diverse subcellular distribution and enriched in endocytic trafficking, in which gefitinib intervention activated autophagy-mediated EGFR degradation and thus autophagy inhibition elevated gefitinib susceptibility. Alternatively, gefitinib prompted TKI-sensitive EGFR translocating toward cell periphery through Rab7 ubiquitination which may favor efficacy to TKIs suppression. This study revealed that T790M mutation rewired EGFR interactome that guided EGFR to autophagy-mediated degradation to escape treatment, suggesting that combination therapy with TKI and autophagy inhibitor may overcome acquired resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance compromises the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and activation of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) is one of the pivotal strategies for cancer cells to acquire refractory phenotype. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating MET activity remain to be further elucidated. Using gefitinib-resistant HCC827GR cell line as a model, we unraveled that the dysregulated amino acid metabolisms reflected by elevated expression of cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2), cystine/glutamate antiporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and asparagine synthetase (ASNS) might contribute to survival advantage of HCC827GR cells, and rendered the cells more sensitive to asparagine (ASN) deprivation compared to parental HCC827 cells. We further identified that the increased ASNS expression is a contributing factor for the activation of MET in HCC827GR cells. More importantly, we found that methylseleninic acid (MSeA), a precursor of methylselenol, effectively suppressed tumor growth in HCC827GR xenograft model, which is associated with decrease of intracellular ASN content along with inactivation of MET- T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) signaling axis. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of MSeA and gefitinib induced a synergistic growth inhibition in HCC827GR cells. The findings of our work reveal that ASN-MET-TOPK signaling axis as a novel mechanism contributed to gefitinib-resistance and combined utilization of gefitinib and MSeA holds potential to improve the efficacy for gefitinib-resistant NSCLC.",

Most exon-20 mutations are resistant to first, second and third generation EGFR-directed TKI. This case was discussed on our molecular tumour board. As the more specific exon-20 targeted therapies were not yet available and as sporadic short responses on the third generation EGFR-directed TKI, osimertinib had been described, the patient started osimertinib. She had a prolonged tumoral response on Osimertinib. The patient is still asymptomatic up to 32 months after initiating the medication. This case confirms that not all exon20 EGFR mutations are equal to osimertinib and that the localization of the exon 20 insertion mutation is probably important to consider when treating EGFR mutated NSCLC. The long-term clinical benefit can be maintained through stereotactic radiotherapy on focal progressive lesions.",

High levels of APOBEC mutagenesis are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease across diverse cancers, but the mechanistic and functional impacts of APOBEC mutagenesis on tumor evolution and therapy resistance remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we investigated the contribution of APOBEC mutagenesis to acquired therapy resistance in a model of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. We find that inhibition of EGFR in lung cancer cells leads to a rapid and pronounced induction of APOBEC3 expression and activity. Functionally, APOBEC expression promotes the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) following EGFR inhibition. Constitutive expression of APOBEC3B alters the evolutionary trajectory of acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, making it more likely that resistance arises through ",

    "abstract": "Mobocertinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively targets epidermal growth factor receptor exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) mutations. It is a structural analog of the third-generation TKI osimertinib, which targets EGFR T790M mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, mobocertinib gains selectivity for EGFRex20ins mutants over wild type (WT) by interacting with the C790 gatekeeper residue of EGFR. This is accomplished via a carboxylated isopropyl ester moiety at the C5-position of mobocertinib's central pyrimidine core. In Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion studies, mobocertinib was found to have an investigator-confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 56% (9/16; 95% CI: 30-80%) and 25% (3/12; 95% CI: 5-57%) in patients without and with baseline brain metastasis, respectively. Median investigator-assessed progression-free survival (mPFS) was 10.2 months (95% CI: 5.6 - not reached) and 3.7 months (95% CI: 1.8-15.9) in patients without and with baseline brain metastasis, respectively. A third phase evaluated patients who had received pre-treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (PPP) and included an extension cohort (EXCLAIM cohort) which evaluated patients treated previously with 1 or 2 lines of therapy. An Independent Review Committee (IRC) found both cohorts to have similar outcomes in terms of ORR, median time to response, mPFS, and disease progression or death. The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) related to mobocertinib are similar to other EGFR inhibitors and are predominately gastrointestinal (eg diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and cutaneous (eg rash). In September 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval for mobocertinib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFRex20ins mutation whose disease progressed while on platinum-based chemotherapy. The present review describes data that led to the approval of mobocertinib.",

Here we reported a patient diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR positive in September 2016.

In May 2021, troponin and creatinine levels were elevated, and the tumor hyperprogressed to severe lung cancer. Repeated genetic testing revealed that EGFR genotype converted to a non-classical mutation and EGFR T790M turned negative, which caused third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance. As a result, afatinib combined with anlotinib was selected to stabilize the patient's condition. We were inspired by the case that it reflects the significance and necessity of exploring the resistance mechanism and dynamically detecting genetic status throughout the course of treatment, which may help realize individualized precision therapy, and maximize the potential of patient.",

    "abstract": "The present multicenter study was performed to compare the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) monotherapy with that of combined EGFR-TKI plus vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) inhibitor/cytotoxic therapy in patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data from patients with PD-L1-positive EGFR-mutant NSCLC were collected from 12 institutes. Survival in patients treated with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib (third-generation EGFR-TKI), and combined EGFR-TKI plus VEGF inhibitor/cytotoxic therapy was analyzed by multiple regression analysis with adjustments for sex, performance status, EGFR mutation status, PD-L1 expression level, and the presence or absence of brain metastasis using a Cox proportional hazards model. Data from a total of 263 patients were analyzed, including 111 (42.2%) patients who had received monotherapy with a first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI, 132 (50.2%) patients who had received osimertinib monotherapy, and 20 (7.6%) patients who had received combined EGFR-TKI plus VEGF inhibitor/cytotoxic therapy (hereafter referred to as combined therapy). Multiple regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for progression-free survival was 0.73 (0.54-1.00) in the patients who had received osimertinib monotherapy and 0.47 (0.25-0.90) in patients who had received combined therapy. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.98 (0.65-1.48) in the patients who had received osimertinib monotherapy and 0.52 (0.21-1.31) in patients who had received combined therapy. In conclusion, combined therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progression compared with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy, and therefore, may be promising for the treatment of patients of NSCLC.",

The present study sought to identify the potential protein osteopontin (OPN) involved in EGFR-TKI resistance and examine its therapeutic mechanism in NSCLC. The expression of OPN in NSCLC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Western blot (WB), quantitative real\u2011time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze OPN and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression in the PC9 and PC9 gefitinib resistance (PC9GR) cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to detect the secreted OPN. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and flow cytometry were used to examine the effect of OPN on the gefitinib-induced growth and death of PC9 or PC9GR cells. OPN was upregulated in the human NSCLC tissues and cells resistant to EGFR-TKIs. The overexpression of OPN inhibited EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis and was associated with the formation of EMT. By activating the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)-EMT pathway, OPN contributed to the development of EGFR-TKI resistance. Reducing OPN expression and inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling improved EGFR-TKI sensitivity significantly more than the use of either agent alone. This study showed that OPN increased EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC through the OPN-PI3K/AKT-EMT pathway. Our findings may provide a possible therapeutic target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in this pathway.",

    "title": "Gefitinib derivatives and drug-resistance: A perspective from molecular dynamics simulations.",
    "abstract": "Epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (TK) with a significant role in cell survival. EGFR is upregulated in various cancer cells and known as a druggable target. Gefitinib is a first-line TK inhibitor used against metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite initial clinical response, a conserved therapeutic effect could not be achieved due to the occurrence of resistance mechanisms. Point mutations in EGFR genes are one of the major causes of rendered tumor sensitivity. To aid in the development of more efficient TKIs, chemical structures of prevailing drugs and their target binding patterns are very important. The aim of the present study was to propose synthetically-accessible gefitinib congeners with enhanced binding fitness to clinically frequent EGFR mutants. Docking simulations of intended molecules identified 1-(4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl)-3-(oxazolidin-2-ylmethyl) thiourea (23) as a top-binder structure inside G719S, T790\u00a0M, L858R and T790 M/L858R-EGFR active sites. Superior docked complexes were subjected to the entire 400 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Analysis of data revealed the stability of mutant enzymes upon binding to molecule 23. All mutant complexes with the exception of a T790 M/L858R-EGFR, were majorly stabilized through cooperative hydrophobic contacts. Pairwise analysis of H-bonds proved Met793 as the conserved residue with stable H-bond participations as hydrogen bond donor (Frequency 63-96%). Amino acid decomposition analysis confirmed the probable role of Met793 in complex stabilization. Estimated binding free energies indicated the proper accommodation of molecule 23 inside target active sites. Pairwise energy decompositions of stable binding modes revealed the energetic contribution of key residues. Although wet lab experiments are required to unravel the mechanistic details of mEGFR inhibition, MD results provide structural basis for those events that are difficult to address experimentally. The outputs of the current study may assist to design small molecules with high potency to mEGFRs.",

The factors that predict the survival outcomes of different second-line treatments after disease progression were evaluated. Clinical and demographic characteristics, including metastatic sites, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at first-line progression, and second-line treatment regimens, and whether re-biopsied after disease progression or not, were reviewed for outcome analysis. The univariate analysis showed that the PFS was shorted in male patients (p =0.049), patients with ECOG performance state \u2265 2 (p =0.014), former smokers (p =0.003), patients with brain metastasis (p =0.04), second-line chemotherapy or EGFR-TKIs other than osimertinib (p =0.002), and NLR \u22655.0 (p=0.024). In addition, second-line osimertinib was associated with longer OS compared to chemotherapy and other EGFR-TKI treatment (p =0.001).

Patients with NLR \u22655.0 at disease progression had shorter OS than patients with NLR <5.0 (p = 0.008).

    "abstract": "In December 2018, China launched national volume-based procurement (NVBP) to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. Gefitinib was one of the 25 pilot drugs, which is used for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer in China and targeted drugs like gefitinib have been proven to provide clinical benefits to patients. This study aims to explore the impact of NVBP policy on the usage and expenditure of anticancer drugs. Gefitinib and alternative drugs (icotinib and erlotinib) were used as objects of study. Quarterly data from the China Hospital Pharmaceutical Audit database in 9454 hospitals in China were used for analysis. Descriptive analysis was conducted using purchase volume and expenditure as variables. Interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis was applied to further analyse the effect of NVBP policy on the medicines under study. During the 12-month period before (2018Q2-2019Q1) and after (2019Q2-2020Q1) the NVBP policy, the total purchase volume of medicines rose from 4.48 million defined daily dose (DDD) to 7.02 million DDD, with an increase of 56.66%. Purchase volume of gefitinib and alternative drugs increased 100.61% and 14.88%, respectively. After the implementation of NVBP policy, procurement volume of alternative drugs decreased by 72 051 DDD (p value=0.044) and trend change decreased by 56 738 DDD (p value<0.01). The overall expenditure reduction was 14.7%, with the expenditure of gefitinib reducing by 38.47% and alternative drugs increasing by 10.70%. ITS analysis indicated statistically significant differences in level and trend changes for expenditure of total drugs and gefitinib. The evidence provided in this study indicated that the implementation of NVBP policy was related to the expenditure reduction of the first generation of anti-EGFR lung cancer drugs. The policy effectively controlled the increase in expenditures for corresponding drugs while ensuring the use of drugs.",

Patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to lazertinib (240 mg/day) or gefitinib (250 mg/day). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). In total, 172 Korean patients were enrolled (lazertinib, n=87; gefitinib, n=85). Baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. One-third of patients had brain metastases (BM) at baseline. Median PFS was 20.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.7 to 26.1) for lazertinib and 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 12.3) for gefitinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.60). This was supported by PFS analysis based on blinded independent central review. Significant PFS benefit with lazertinib was consistently observed across predefined subgroups, including patients with BM (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.53) and those with L858R mutations (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.63). Lazertinib safety data were consistent with its previously reported safety profile. Common adverse events (AEs) in both groups included rash, pruritus, and diarrhoea. Numerically fewer severe AEs and severe treatment-related AEs occurred with lazertinib than gefitinib. Consistent with results for the overall LASER301 population, this analysis showed significant PFS benefit with lazertinib versus gefitinib with comparable safety in Korean patients with untreated EGFRm NSCLC, supporting lazertinib as a new potential treatment option for this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been widely used for human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs is the major barrier of treatment success, and new resistance mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that elevated NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expression was associated with acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance. Gefitinib is the first-generation FDA-approved EGFR-TKI, and osimertinib is the third-generation FDA-approved EGFR-TKI. We demonstrated that NOX4 knockdown in the EGFR-TKI resistant cells enabled the cells to become sensitive to gefitinib and osimertinib treatment, while forced expression of NOX4 in the sensitive parental cells was sufficient to induce resistance to gefitinib and osimertinib in the cells. To elucidate the mechanism of NOX4 upregulation in increasing TKIs resistance, we found that knockdown of NOX4 significantly down-regulated the expression of transcription factor YY1. YY1 bound directly to the promoter region of IL-8 to transcriptionally activate IL-8 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of NOX4 and IL-8 decreased programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which provide new insight on TKIs resistance and immune escape. We found that patients with higher NOX4 and IL-8 expression levels showed a shorter survival time compared to those with lower NOX4 and IL-8 expression levels in response to the anti-PD-L1 therapy. Knockdown of NOX4, YY1 or IL-8 alone inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth. Furthermore, the combination of NOX4 inhibitor GKT137831 and gefitinib had synergistic effect to inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth and to increase cellular apoptosis. These findings demonstrated that NOX4 and YY1 were essential for mediating the acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance. IL-8 and PD-L1 are two downstream targets of NOX4 to regulate TKIs resistance and immunotherapy. These molecules may be used as potential new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for overcoming TKIs resistance in the future.",

Both the ORR and DCR of the antiangiogenic-based group were higher than the immunotherapy group and the chemotherapy group. Subgroup analysis showed a trend of more benefits from the anlotinib-based therapy than the bevacizumab-based therapy in terms of PFS (HR: 0.63, p\u2009=\u20090.087) and OS (HR: 0.52, p\u2009=\u20090.063). In vitro assays verified that anlotinib alone or combined with osimertinib exerted potent cytotoxicity to T790M-mutant H1975 cell line with acquired osimertinib resistance. Our study suggested that antiangiogenic-based therapy might improve PFS and OS in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib. Moreover, anlotinib-based therapy could be a promising effective treatment for this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic remodeling is crucial in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Oncogenic mutations may promote metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells to support their energy and biomass requirements. EGFR mutations are commonly found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and may induce NSCLC metabolic rewiring. Whether EGFR-driven metabolic reprogramming triggers cell vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential remains unknown. The role of EGFR signaling activation by EGF was investigated using NSCLC cell lines with different EGFR and KRAS status: A549 (EGFR WT and KRAS c.34G\u00a0>\u00a0A), H292 (EGFR WT and KRAS WT) and PC-9 (EGFR exon 19 E746-A750 deletion and KRAS WT). The effect of EGF on NSCLC cell death and cell cycle was evaluated using flow cytometry, and cell migration was assessed through wound healing. EGFR, HER2, MCT1, and MCT4 expression was analyzed through immunofluorescence or western blotting. We explored the impact of glucose and lactate bioavailability on NSCLC cells' metabolic profile using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the expression of several relevant metabolic genes in NSCLC cells or patient samples was determined by RT-qPCR. We showed that cell lines presented different metabolic profiles, and PC-9 cells were the most responsive to EGF stimulus, as they showed higher rates of cell proliferation and migration, together with altered metabolic behavior. By inhibiting EGFR with gefitinib, a decrease in glucose consumption was observed, which may be related to the fact that despite PC-9 harbor EGFR mutation, they still express the EGFR WT allele. The analysis of NSCLC patients' RNA showed a correlation between MCT1/MCT4 and GLUT1 expression in most cases, indicating that the metabolic information can serve as a reference in patients' follow-up. Together, this study shows that NSCLC cell lines have heterogeneous metabolic profiles, which may be underlaid by different genetic profiles, revealing an opportunity to identify and stratify patients who can benefit from metabolism-targeted therapies.",

This was a retrospective, exploratory analysis of two phase III trials [AURA3 (NCT02151981), FLAURA (NCT02296125)]. All patients had EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm; ex19del or L858R) advanced NSCLC; AURA3 also included T790M-positive NSCLC. Osimertinib (FLAURA, AURA3), or comparator EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI; gefitinib/erlotinib; FLAURA), or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (AURA3) was given. Plasma EGFRm was analyzed at baseline and Weeks 3/6 by droplet digital PCR. Outcomes were assessed by detectable/non-detectable baseline plasma EGFRm and plasma EGFRm clearance (non-detection) at Weeks 3/6. In AURA3 (n = 291), non-detectable versus detectable baseline plasma EGFRm had longer median progression-free survival [mPFS; HR, 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.68; P < 0.0001]. In patients with Week 3 clearance versus non-clearance (n = 184), respectively, mPFS (months; 95% CI) was 10.9 (8.3-12.6) versus 5.7 (4.1-9.7) with osimertinib and 6.2 (4.0-9.7) versus 4.2 (4.0-5.1) with platinum-pemetrexed. In FLAURA (n = 499), mPFS was longer with non-detectable versus detectable baseline plasma EGFRm (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41-0.70; P < 0.0001).

    "abstract": "Almost 17% of Western patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation. Del19 and L858R are the most-common ones; they are positive predictive factors for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Currently, osimertinib, a third-generation TKI, is the standard first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients with common EGFR mutations. This drug is also administered as a second-line treatment for those patients with the T790M EGFR mutation and previously treated with first- (erlotinib, gefitinib) or second- (afatinib) generation TKIs. However, despite the high clinical efficacy, the prognosis remains severe due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGRF-TKIs. Various mechanisms of resistance have been reported including the activation of other signalling pathways, the development of secondary mutations, the alteration of the downstream pathways, and phenotypic transformation. However, further data are needed to achieve the goal of overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKIs, hence the necessity of discovering novel genetic targets and developing new-generation drugs. This review aimed to deepen the knowledge of intrinsic and acquired molecular mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and the development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome TKIs' resistance.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation has a higher incidence of brain metastases than wild-type EGFR mutations. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), targets both EGFR-TKI sensitizing and T790M-resistance mutations and has a higher brain penetration rate relative to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, osimertinib has become a preferred first-line therapy for advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. However, lazertinib, an emerging EGFR-TKI, has shown higher selectivity toward EGFR mutations and improved penetration of the blood-brain barrier compared to osimertinib in preclinical studies. This trial will evaluate the efficacy of lazertinib as a first-line therapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who have brain metastases, with or without additional local therapy. This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II trial. A total of 75 patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC will be recruited. Eligible patients will receive oral lazertinib 240\u2009mg, once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity is detected. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms related to brain metastasis will simultaneously receive local therapy for the brain. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and intracranial progression-free survival. Lazertinib, in combination with local therapy for the brain, if necessary, is expected to improve the clinical benefit in advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with brain metastases, as a first-line treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib (GFT) is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor clinically used for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Bioactivation by mainly Phase I hepatic metabolism leads to chemically reactive metabolites such as O-Demethyl gefitinib (DMT-GFT), 4-Defluoro-4-hydroxy gefitinib (DF-GFT), and O-Demorpholinopropyl gefitinib (DMOR-GFT), which display an enhanced UV-light absorption. In this context, the aim of the present study is to investigate the capability of gefitinib metabolites to induce photosensitivity disorders and to elucidate the involved mechanisms. According to the neutral red uptake (NRU) phototoxicity test, only DF-GFT metabolite can be considered non-phototoxic to cells with a photoirritation factor (PIF) close to 1. Moreover, DMOR-GFT is markedly more phototoxic than the parent drug (PIF = 48), whereas DMT-GFT is much less phototoxic (PIF = 7). Using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method as an indicator of lipid photoperoxidation, only DMOR-GFT has demonstrated the ability to photosensitize this process, resulting in a significant amount of TBARS (similar to ketoprofen, which was used as the positive control). Protein photooxidation monitored by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatization method is mainly mediated by GFT and, to a lesser extent, by DMOR-GFT; in contrast, protein oxidation associated with DMT-GFT is nearly negligible. Interestingly, the damage to cellular DNA as revealed by the comet assay, indicates that DMT-GFT has the highest photogenotoxic potential; moreover, the DNA damage induced by this metabolite is hardly repaired by the cells after a time recovery of 18\u00a0h. This could ultimately result in mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. These results could aid oncologists when prescribing TKIs to cancer patients and, thus, establish the conditions of use and recommend photoprotection guidelines.",

    "abstract": "ASTRIS study aimed the largest to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of second- or higher-line osimertinib in patients with advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the real-world setting. Here we report the results of Chinese patients in ASTRIS study. Adults with EGFR T790M-positive advanced NSCLC pretreated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), having a WHO performance status score of 0-2 and asymptomatic, stable central nervous system (CNS) metastases were included. All patients received once-daily osimertinib 80\u00a0mg orally. The outcomes included investigator-assessed clinical response, progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), and safety. A total of 1350 patients were included. Response rate was 55.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.58). The median PFS and the median TTD were 11.7\u00a0months (95% CI 11.1-12.5) and 13.9\u00a0months (95% CI 13.1-15.2), respectively. Overall, 389 patients (28.8%) had at least one protocol-specified adverse event (AE); AEs of interstitial lung diseases/pneumonitis-like events and QT prolongation were reported in 3 (0.2%) and 59 (4.4%) patients, respectively. Osimertinib was effective in Chinese patients with T790M-positive NSCLC who had progressed after first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI in real-word setting and the results were consistent with ASTRIS study overall population and AURA studies. No new safety signals or events were identified. NCT02474355.",

However, there is a paucity of data with which to compare the efficacy and safety of second- and third-generation TKIs in patients with NSCLC carrying uncommon EGFR mutations. We compared the efficacy and safety of second- and third-generation TKIs in all NSCLC patients in whom next-generation sequencing confirmed uncommon EGFR mutations, including G719X, S768I, and L861Q. The parameters analyzed included the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The rate of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reflected the safety of these TKIs. Eighty-four NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations were enrolled between April 2016 and May 2022 at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, including 63 treated with second-generation TKIs and 21 treated with third-generation TKIs. The ORR for all patients receiving TKIs was 47.6%, and the DCR was 86.9%. The median PFS for NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations receiving TKIs was 11.9\u2009months and OS was 30.6\u2009months. There was no significant difference in PFS after treatment with second- or third-generation TKIs (13.3 vs. 11.0\u2009months, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.910) or in OS (30.6 vs. 24.6\u2009months, respectively P\u2009=\u20090.623). The third-generation TKIs showed no severe toxicity. The efficacy of second- and third-generation TKIs for NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations does not differ, and so can be used to treat NSCLC patients with these mutations.",

    "abstract": "Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) expression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, whether HDGF affects gefitinib resistance in NSCLC remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of HDGF in gefitinib resistance in NSCLC and to discover the underlying mechanisms. Stable HDGF knockout or overexpression cell lines were generated to perform experiments in vitro and in vivo. HDGF concentrations were determined using an ELISA kit. HDGF overexpression exacerbated the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells, while HDGF knockdown exerted the opposite effects. Furthermore, PC-9 cells, which were initially gefitinib-sensitive, became resistant to gefitinib treatment after HDGF overexpression, whereas HDGF knockdown enhanced gefitinib sensitivity in H1975 cells, which were initially gefitinib-resistant. Higher levels of HDGF in plasma or tumor tissue also indicated gefitinib resistance. The effects of HDGF on promoting the gefitinib resistance were largely attenuated by MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) or U0126 (ERK inhibitor). Mechanistically, gefitinib treatment provoked HDGF expression and activated the Akt and ERK pathways, which were independent of EGFR phosphorylation. In summary, HDGF contributes to gefitinib resistance by activating the Akt and ERK signaling pathways. The higher HDGF levels may predict poor efficacy for TKI treatment, thus it has the potential to serve as a new target for overcoming tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in combating NSCLC.",

Hence, inhibition of calcium signaling may be a promising cancer treatment strategy. In this study, we aimed to examine whether calcium channel blockers (CCBs) affect the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We conducted a retrospective analysis. In this study, conducted between January 2009 and June 2021, patients with NSCLC treated with erlotinib, or gefitinib for at least 1\u2009week were enrolled and divided into 2 groups: CCBs-/EGFR-TKIs+ and CCBs+/EGFR-TKIs+, depending on whether they received CCB therapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined as the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. : The estimated median PFS and OS for the CCBs-/EGFR-TKIs+group were 7.70 and 12.17\u2009months, respectively, and they were significantly different from those of the CCBs+/EGFR-TKIs+ group (10.43 and 18.07\u2009months, respectively). CCB use was associated with improved PFS (adjusted hazard ratios [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.98;  Calcium channels have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Our findings revealed the potential additive anticancer effects of CCBs when used concomitantly with EGFR-TKIs.

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, is the standard therapy for previously untreated EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients following the landmark FLAURA study. However, resistance inevitably hinders patient prognosis, increasing the need for new therapeutic strategies beyond osimertinib. Frontline osimertinib-based combination strategies (platinum-based chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors) are currently being tested primarily to prevent initial resistance. In the later-line setting after osimertinib, many next-line therapeutic candidates have been actively examined in clinical trials. Notably, several drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as antibody-drug conjugates and EGFR -MET bispecific antibodies, have shown promising efficacy despite the resistance mechanisms and are close to clinical application. In addition, genotype-based target strategies have been investigated for a better understanding of osimertinib resistance mechanisms based on molecular profiling tests at relapse. The C797S mutation and MET gene alterations are commonly identified following osimertinib resistance, for which targeting strategies are actively tested. This review describes current pharmacotherapeutic strategies for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer based on the results of clinical trials and the latest published data, broadly grouped into two sections: 1) EGFR TKIs-based combination therapy in the front-line setting and 2) novel therapeutic strategies after osimertinib resistance.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) are strongly recommended for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring active EGFR mutations, while drug resistance makes exploring resistance mechanisms and seeking effective therapeutic strategies urgent endeavours. Thymidylate synthetase (TYMS or TS) is a dominant enzyme in thymidylate nucleotide metabolism. In this study, we found a positive correlation between TS expression and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in lung adenocarcinoma. The examination of gene sets from 140 NSCLC patients received EGFR-TKI therapy demonstrated a negative correlation between high TS expression and the efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy. 24 tissue specimens from NSCLC patients exhibited upregulated TS mRNA expression in NSCLC patients resistant to gefitinib. The NSCLC cell PC9 and HCC827 sensitive to gefitinib and relatively resistant PC9/GR and HCC827/GR cells were used to demonstrate the knockdown of TS restored the sensitivity of resistant cells to gefitinib. Furthermore, pemetrexed effectively suppressed TS-mediated thymidylate metabolism and induced ROS generation, DNA damage and cellular senescence, thereby hampering cancer progression and restoring sensitivity to gefitinib. Our findings illuminate the potential mechanism of TS-triggered gefitinib resistance and indicate inhibition of TS by pemetrexed can potentiate the effect of gefitinib in NSCLC. Pemetrexed combined with gefitinib has potent anti-progression potential in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. This study suggests that NSCLC patients with both high TS expression and EGFR-driving mutations might benefit more from a combination strategy of EGFR-TKI and pemetrexed-based chemotherapy than EGFR-TKI monotherapy, which has profound clinical implications and therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with a poor prognosis and the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The development of mutations makes lung cancer treatment more challenging and expensive. Successful identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations led to the discovery of various third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Osimertinib is one of the promising and efficacious third-generation EGFR inhibitors and is mainly employed in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Despite the initial effective response, osimertinib causes resistance in most of the patients after around 10 months of therapy, resulting in disease progression. To mitigate the effect of developed resistance, different osimertinib derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated by numerous research groups across the globe. Present article illustrates recent research advancements for the utilization of osimertinib and its derivatives in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Last seven years literature search has been conducted from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, etc. Result: The present review emphasizes the recent advancements of osimertinib analogues that lead to enhanced antitumor potential and safety profile against non-small cell lung cancer. This manuscript also summarizes the different synthetic schemes involved in the synthesis of osimertinib analogues against EGFR reported by different research groups.

    "abstract": "Fuzheng Kang-Ai (FZKA) decoction is mainly composed of 12 components with different types of herbs. In the last decade, FZKA has been used as an adjuvant treatment for lung cancer in clinical practice. Our previous studies have confirmed that FZKA shows a strong anti-cancer activity, significantly increases the clinical efficacy of gefitinib and reverses gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the molecular mechanism still needs to be further elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism by which FZKA inhibited the cell growth, proliferation and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma(LUAD) and reversed the acquired resistance of gefitinib for the therapy in LUAD. Cell viability assay and EDU assay were used for detecting of cell viability and cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to measure cell invasion. Western Blot and qRT-PCR were used for protein and gene expression test. The gene promoter activity was determined by dul-luciferase reporter assay. The in situ expression of protein was measured by cell immunofluorescence. Stabilized cell lines were established for stable overexpression of EZH2. Transient transfection assay was used for gene silence and overexpression. Xenograft tumors and bioluminescent imaging were used for in vivo experiments. FZKA significantly inhibited the cell viability, proliferation and cell invasion of LUAD, the combination of FZKA and gefitinib had a great synergy on the above processes. Moreover, FZKA significantly decreased EZH2 mRNA and protein expression, FZKA reversed the resistance of gefitinib by down-regulation of EZH2 protein. ERK1/2 kinase mediated the down-regulation of EZH2 reduced by FZKA. In addition, FZKA decreased the expression of Snail and EGFR by decreasing EZH2. Overexpression of Snail and EGFR significantly reversed the effect of FZKA-inhibited cell invasion and cell proliferation. More important, the combination of FZKA and gefitinib enhanced the inhibitory effect on EZH2, Snail and EGFR proteins. Furthermore, the growth inhibition and reversal of gefitinib resistance induced by FZKA were further validated in vivo. Finally, the expression and clinical correlation of EZH2,EGFR and Snail in cancer patients were further validated using bioinformatics analysis. FZKA significantly suppressed tumor progression and reversed gefitinib resistance by regulating the p-ERK1/2-EZH2-Snail/EGFR signaling pathway in LUAD.",

We performed a single-arm, prospective, open-label, multi-institutional phase II trial for comprehensive skin toxicity prophylaxis. Patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations were enrolled and received dacomitinib with comprehensive prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of skin toxicity (Grade\u2009\u22652) in the initial 8\u2009weeks. In total, 41 Japanese patients participated between May 2019 and April 2021 from 14 institutions (median age 70\u2009years; range: 32-83\u2009years), 20 were male, and 36 had a performance status of 0-1. Nineteen patients had exon 19 deletions and L858R mutation. More than 90% of patients were perfectly compliant with prophylactic minocycline administration. Skin toxicities (Grade\u2009\u22652) occurred in 43.9% of patients (90% confidence interval [CI], 31.2%-56.7%). The most frequent skin toxicity was acneiform rash in 11 patients (26.8%), followed by paronychia in five patients (12.2%). Due to skin toxicities, eight patients (19.5%) received reduced doses of dacomitinib. The median progression-free survival was 6.8\u2009months (95% CI, 4.0-8.6\u2009months) and median OS was 21.6\u2009months (95% CI, 17.0\u2009months-not reached). Although the prophylactic strategy was ineffective, the adherence to prophylactic medication was quite good. Patient education regarding prophylaxis is important and can lead to improved treatment continuity.",

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of upfront use of first-/second-generation TKI followed by osimertinib with upfront osimertinib therapy for each representative EGFR mutation in Japanese patients with NSCLC. Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC were classified into two groups: first-/second-generation TKI followed by osimertinib (sequential TKI group) and upfront osimertinib groups. The total time to treatment failure (TTF) of TKI therapies, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively evaluated. Of the 74 patients included in the analysis, 38 and 34 patients had exon 19 deletion and L858R, respectively, and other two patients had minor mutations. The sequential TKI group had a significantly longer TTF than the upfront osimertinib group in overall patients (33.2 vs. 11.2 months; p\u2009=\u20090.007) and in the subgroup of exon 19 deletion (36.7 vs. 10.0 months; p\u2009=\u20090.004), but not in the subgroup of L858R (22.6 vs. 15.6 months; p\u2009=\u20090.37). The similar tendency was observed in PFS. OS of the sequential TKI group was significantly longer compared with the upfront osimertinib group in overall patients, the subgroup of exon 19 deletion, and the subgroup of L858R. The upfront use of first-/second-generation TKI followed by osimertinib is one of the feasible and effective strategies in Japanese patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, especially in patients with exon 19 deletion.",

We aimed to evaluate whether gefitinib increases the risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation and analyze the associated risk factors.A total of 122 cases of advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received gefitinib therapy from January 2015 to December 2020 were evaluated. The results of at least two resting 12-lead electrocardiogram before and after gefitinib treatment were obtained. The Bazett and Fridericia formulas were used to calculate the QTc interval, and the changes of QTc interval values before and after treatment were evaluated. The correlation between gefitinib and QTc interval prolongation and related risk factors were analyzed.After gefitinib-targeted therapy, 23 patients (18.9%) had a prolonged QTc interval, which increased from a mean of 446 \u00b1 25 ms at baseline to 478 \u00b1 18 ms (P < 0.001). Three of the patients met criteria for Grade 3 QTc prolongation in the common term V5.0 for clinical adverse events. Univariate analysis showed that age (ORR, 1.054; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.107; P = 0.038), history of hypertension (ORR, 3.409; 95% CI, 1.334-8.713; P = 0.01), CCB medication history (ORR, 0.259; 95% CI, 0.094-0.712; P = 0.009), history of lung cancer surgery (ORR, 0.231; 95% CI, 0.064-0.829; P = 0.025), and baseline QT interval (ORR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.964-0.993; P = 0.004) were important predictors of QTc interval prolongation in patients treated with gefitinib. The results of multivariate analysis showed that the history of lung cancer surgery and the baseline QT interval were important factors affecting QTc interval prolongation in patients treated with gefitinib.Gefitinib increases the risk of QTc prolongation in NSCLC patients, which may be more pronounced in patients with advanced age, hypertension, CCB therapy, lung cancer surgery, and a long QT interval at baseline.",

Currently, no targeted treatment option is available for these patients. We have developed a new EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), BBT-176, targeting the C797S mutation. Recombinant EGFR proteins and Ba/F3 cell lines, patient-derived cells, and patient-derived xenografts expressing mutant EGFRs were used to test the inhibitory potency and the anticancer efficacy of BBT-176 both in vitro and in vivo. Patient case data are also available from an ongoing phase I clinical trial (NCT04820023). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of BBT-176 against EGFR 19Del/C797S, EGFR 19Del/T790M/C797S, and EGFR L858R/C797S proteins were measured at 4.36, 1.79, and 5.35 nmol/L, respectively (vs. 304.39, 124.82, and 573.72 nmol/L, for osimertinib). IC50 values of BBT-176 against Ba/F3 cells expressing EGFR 19Del/C797S, EGFR 19Del/T790M/C797S, EGFR L858R/C797S, and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S were 42, 49, 183, and 202 nmol/L, respectively (vs. 869, 1,134, 2,799, and 2,685 nmol/L for osimertinib). N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis suggested that BBT-176 treatment does not introduce any secondary mutations in the EGFR gene but increases EGFR expression levels. Combined with the EGFR antibody cetuximab, BBT-176 effectively suppressed the growth of BBT-176-resistant clones. BBT-176 strongly inhibited the tumor growth, and in some conditions induced tumor regression in mouse models. In the clinical trial, two patients harboring EGFR 19Del/T790M/C797S in blood showed tumor shrinkage and radiologic improvements. BBT-176 is a fourth-generation EGFR inhibitor showing promising preclinical activity against NSCLC resistant to current EGFR TKI, with early clinical efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "In ADAURA, adjuvant osimertinib significantly improved disease-free survival versus placebo in resected stage IB to IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC. We report in-depth analyses of three-year safety, tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from ADAURA. Patients were randomized 1:1 to osimertinib 80 mg or placebo once daily for up to 3 years. Safety assessments were performed at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks until treatment completion or discontinuation, and 28 days after treatment was stopped. The SF-36 survey measured HRQoL at baseline, week 12, week 24, and every 24 weeks until recurrence, treatment completion or discontinuation. Data cutoff: April 11,\u00a02022. Safety and HRQoL analysis sets: osimertinib, n\u00a0= 337 and n\u00a0= 339; placebo, n\u00a0= 343 each. Median (range) total exposure duration was longer with osimertinib versus placebo: 35.8 (0-38) versus 25.1 (0-39) months. Most adverse events (AEs) were first reported within 12 months of starting treatment (osimertinib 97%, placebo 86%). AEs leading to dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation were reported in 12%, 27% and 13% respectively of patients with osimertinib; 1%, 13% and 3% with placebo. Stomatitis and diarrhea were the most common AEs leading to osimertinib dose reduction or interruption; interstitial lung disease was the most common leading to osimertinib discontinuation (per protocol). There were no differences in time to deterioration for SF-36 physical, mental component summaries between osimertinib and placebo. No new safety signals were reported and HRQoL was maintained with 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib treatment. Combined with significant efficacy benefit, these data further support adjuvant osimertinib in stage IB to IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

For patients harboring non-traditional mutations, genomic and transcriptomic sequencing can help direct treatment. As cancer genomics evolves, novel driver mutations continue to be uncovered. We report on a unique EGFR-GRB2 fusion in a 48-year-old female never-smoker. This patient presented with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (T2aN3M1) with metastatic disease in the iliac wing and liver. Despite systemic treatment, this patient continued to progress. On whole transcriptome sequencing, this patient was found to have a novel EGFR-GRB2 RNA fusion transcript similar to other EGFR fusions described in the literature. After treatment with osimertinib, this patient experienced remarkable clinical and radiological improvements. We believe that, especially for patients with metastatic lung cancer, the presence of novel driver mutations should be investigated. Potentially, patients harboring similar mutations may demonstrate analogous improvements with targeted treatment using the most recent generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Following the outstanding results of the recent ADAURA trial, osimertinib has become a new standard treatment for resected epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-squamous NSCLC, regardless of the administration of chemotherapy. For patients whose disease relapses after completion of the adjuvant therapy, there is no consensus about the optimal treatment. Herein, we report the case of a 74-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IIIA non-squamous NSCLC, harboring the EGFR p.L858R mutation. After complete tumor resection, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine, followed by osimertinib 80\u2005mg daily for 3 years within the ADAURA trial. Brain disease relapse was documented 18 months after treatment completion by computed tomography scans. The patient was then retreated with osimertinib obtaining a deep intracranial partial response, which is still lasting after 21 months. The retreatment with osimertinib in patients whose disease relapsed following adjuvant therapy with the third-generation EGFR inhibitor might be a valid option, especially in patients with intracranial disease relapse.

In this updated report, the existing medical records were reviewed and rechecked. TOT and OS were updated and analyzed according to clinical features using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. TOT and OS were compared with those of the comparator group, in which most patients received pemetrexed-based treatments. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate features that could affect survival outcomes. The median observation time was 31.0 months. The follow-up period was extended to 20 months. A total of 401 patients who received first-line afatinib were analyzed (166 with T790M+ and second-line osimertinib, and 235 with unproven T790M and other second-line agents). Median TOTs on afatinib and osimertinib were 15.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.0 to 16.1) and 11.9 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 14.6), respectively. The median OS in the osimertinib group was 54.3 months (95% CI, 46.7 to 61.9), much longer than that in the comparator group. In patients who received osimertinib, the OS was longest with Del19+ (median, 59.1; 95% CI, 48.7 to 69.5). This is one of the largest real-world studies reporting the encouraging activity of sequential afatinib and osimertinib in Asian patients with EGFR+ NSCLC who acquired the T790M mutation, particularly Del19+.",

    "abstract": "YAP1 is a well-known core effector of the Hippo pathway in tumors, but its potential role in osimertinib resistance remained unexplored. Our study provides evidence that YAP1 acts as a potent promoter of osimertinib resistance. By inhibiting YAP1 with a novel inhibitor, CA3, and combining it with osimertinib, we observed a significant suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, and a delay in the emergence of osimertinib resistance. Interestingly, CA3 combined with osimertinib executed its anti-metastasis and pro-tumor apoptosis in part through autophagy. Mechanistically, we found that YAP1, in collaboration with YY1, transcriptionally represses DUSP1, leading to the dephosphorylation of the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway and YAP1 phosphorylation in osimertinib-resistant cells. Our results also validate that CA3, in combination with osimertinib, executes its anti-metastasis and pro-tumor apoptosis partly through autophagy and the YAP1/DUSP1/EGFR/MEK/ERK regulatory feedback loop in osimertinib-resistant cells. Remarkably, our findings illustrate that YAP1 protein is upregulated in patients after osimertinib treatment and osimertinib resistance. Overall, our study confirms that the YAP1 inhibitor CA3 increases DUSP1 with concomitant activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway and induces autophagy to enhance the efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKI treatments for NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide owing to its strong metastatic ability. EGFR-TKI (Gefitinib) has demonstrated efficacy in metastatic lung cancer therapy, but most patients ultimately develop resistance to Gefitinib, leading to a poor prognosis. Pedunculoside (PE), a triterpene saponin extracted from Ilex rotunda Thunb., has shown anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering and anti-tumor effects. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of PE on NSCLC treatment are unclear. To investigate the inhibitory effect and prospective mechanisms of PE on NSCLC metastases and Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. In vitro, A549/GR cells were established by Gefitinib persistent induction of A549 cells with a low dose and shock with a high dose. The cell migratory ability was measured using wound healing and Transwell assays. Additionally, EMT-related Markers or ROS production were assessed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and flow cytometry assays in A549/GR and TGF-\u03b21-induced A549 cells. In vivo, B16-F10 cells were intravenously injected into mice, and the effect of PE on tumor metastases were determined using hematoxylin-eosin staining, Caliper IVIS Lumina, DCFH PE reversed TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by downregulating EMT-related protein expression through MAPK and Nrf2 pathways, decreasing ROS production, and inhibiting cell migration and invasion ability. Moreover, PE treatment enabled A549/GR cells to retrieve the sensitivity to Gefitinib and mitigate the biological characteristics of EMT. PE also significantly inhibited lung metastasis in mice by reversing EMT proteins expression, decreasing ROS production, and inhibiting MAPK and Nrf2 pathways. Collectively, this research presents a novel finding that PE can reverse NSCLC metastasis and improve Gefitinib sensitivity in Gefitinib-resistant NSCLC through the MAPK and Nrf2 pathways, subsequently suppressing lung metastasis in B16-F10 lung metastatic mice model. Our findings indicate that PE is a potential agent for inhibiting metastasis and improving Gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in EGFR-mutated lung cancer is limited by acquired resistance. In half of the patients treated with first/second-generation (1st/2nd gen) TKI, resistance is associated with EGFR p.T790M mutation. Sequential treatment with osimertinib is highly active in such patients. Currently, there is no approved targeted second-line option for patients receiving first-line osimertinib, which thus may not be the best choice for all patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a sequential TKI treatment with 1st/2nd gen TKI, followed by osimertinib in a real-world setting. Patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer treated at two major comprehensive cancer centers were retrospectively analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. A cohort of 150 patients, of which 133 received first-line treatment with a first/second gen EGFR TKI, and 17 received first-line osimertinib, was included. Median age was 63.9\u00a0years, 55% had ECOG performance score of\u2009\u2265\u20091. First-line osimertinib was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P\u2009=\u20090.038). Since the approval of osimertinib (February 2016), 91 patients were under treatment with a 1st/2nd gen TKI. Median overall survival (OS) of this cohort was 39.3\u00a0months. At data cutoff, 87% had progressed. Of those, 92% underwent new biomarker analyses, revealing EGFR p.T790M in 51%. Overall, 91% of progressing patients received second-line therapy, which was osimertinib in 46%. Median OS with sequenced osimertinib was 50\u00a0months. Median OS of patients with p.T790M-negative progression was 23.4\u00a0months. Real-world survival outcomes of patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer may be superior with a sequenced TKI strategy. Predictors of p.T790M-associated resistance are needed to personalize first-line treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "Surgical resection followed by adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even with the best management, recurrence is common and increases with disease stage (stage I: 26-45%; stage II: 42-62%; stage III: 70-77%). For patients with metastatic lung cancer and tumours that harbour epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved survival. Their effectiveness in advanced stages of NSCLC raises the possibility that these agents may improve outcomes for patients with resectable EGFR-mutated lung cancer. In the ADAURA study, adjuvant osimertinib provided a significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and reduced central nervous system (CNS) disease recurrence in patients with resected stage IB-IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy. To reap the maximum benefits of EGFR-TKIs for patients with lung cancer, the early and rapid identification of EGFR mutations [and other oncogenic drivers, such as programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), with matched targeted therapies] in diagnostic pathologic specimens has become essential. To ensure patients receive the most appropriate treatment, routine, comprehensive histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses (with multiplex next generation sequencing) should be undertaken at the time of diagnosis. The potential for personalised treatments to cure more patients with early-stage lung cancer can only be realised if all therapies are considered when the care plan is formulated, by the multi-specialty experts managing patients. In this review, we discuss the progress and prospects for adjuvant treatments as part of a comprehensive plan of care for patients with resected stages I-III EGFR-mutated lung cancer, and explore how the field could go beyond DFS and overall survival to make cure a more frequent outcome of treatment in patients with resected EGFR-mutated lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "An increasing amount of evidence has confirmed that the altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is critical to the mechanism underlying primary and even acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, studies on the linkage between the altered miRNAs expression and osimertinib resistance are few, and the effect of miRNAs in this context is still unclear. In the light of this, we hypothesized that the differential expression of multiple miRNAs is the driver in the osimertinib resistance process. Thus, the aim of our study was to find differentially expressed miRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer cells resistant to osimertinib. An AZD9291(Osimertinib)-resistant cell line model was constructed, and the differential miRNAs between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitive cell lines A549 and H1975 and the corresponding drug-resistant cell lines were identified via biosynthesis analysis. In the A549 osimertinib-resistant cell line, 93 miRNAs were upregulated and 94 miRNAs were downregulated. In the H1975 osimertinib-resistant cell line, 124 miRNAs were upregulated and 53 miRNAs were downregulated. Finally, 7 significantly different miRNAs were screened using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. This study on the mechanism of target therapy in lung cancer systematically and comprehensively examined the miRNAs involved in osimertinib resistance. It was found that miR-708-5p, miR-708-3p, miR-10395-3p, miR-7704 miR-34a-5p, miR-19b-1-5p, and miR-219a-5p may play key roles in osimertinib resistance.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance mutations emerging during the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors represent a major challenge in personalized cancer treatment and require constant development of new inhibitors. For the covalent irreversible EGFR inhibitor osimertinib, the predominant resistance mechanism is the acquired C797S mutation, which abolishes the covalent anchor point and thus results in a dramatic loss in potency. In this study, we present next-generation reversible EGFR inhibitors with the potential to overcome this EGFR-C797S resistance mutation. For this, we combined the reversible methylindole-aminopyrimidine scaffold known from osimertinib with the affinity driving isopropyl ester of mobocertinib. By occupying the hydrophobic back pocket, we were able to generate reversible inhibitors with subnanomolar activity against EGFR-L858R/C797S and EGFR-L858R/T790M/C797S with cellular activity on EGFR-L858R/C797S dependent Ba/F3 cells. Additionally, we were able to resolve cocrystal structures of these reversible aminopyrimidines, which will guide further inhibitor design toward C797S-mutated EGFR.",

Although TKIs have been reported to cause cardiotoxicity, they are widely administered owing to the high prevalence of EGFR sequence variation in Taiwan. To compare the outcomes of death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events among patients with NSCLC who use and do not use TKIs in a national cohort. Using data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database and National Cancer Registry, patients treated for NSCLC from 2011 to 2018 were identified, and their outcomes were analyzed, including death and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs; such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) after adjusting for age, sex, cancer stage, comorbidities, anticancer therapies, and cardiovascular drugs. The median follow-up duration was 1.45 years. The analyses were performed from September 2022 to March 2023. TKIs. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate death and MACCEs in patients treated with and without TKIs. Given that death may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, the competing risk method was used to calculate the MACCE risk after adjustment for all potential confounders. Overall, 24\u202f129 patients treated with TKIs were matched with 24\u202f129 patients who did not receive TKIs (24\u202f215 [50.18%] were female; and the mean [SD] age was 66.93 [12.37] years). Compared with those not receiving TKIs, the TKI group presented with a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause death (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and the reason for death was primarily cancer. In contrast, the HR of MACCEs significantly increased (subdistribution HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16-1.29; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in the TKI group. Furthermore, afatinib use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death among patients receiving various TKIs (adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with those receiving erlotinib and gefitinib, although the outcomes of MACCEs were similar between the 2 groups. In this cohort study of patients with NSCLC, TKI use was associated with reduced HRs of cancer-related death but increased HRs of MACCEs. These findings suggest the importance of close monitoring of cardiovascular problems in individuals receiving TKIs.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations are the most common driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To prolong the survival of the patients, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance in NSCLC is a major challenge that needs to be addressed urgently, and this study focuses on investigating the mechanism of cigarette smoke (CS) induced Gefitinib resistance in NSCLC. PC-9 and A549 cells were cultured in vitro and treated with 1 \u00b5mol/L Gefitinib for 4 h and 10% cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 48 h. Western blot was used to detect Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) protein expressions; DCFH-DA probe was used to detect intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); CCK-8 kit was used to detect cell activity, and EdU was used to detect cell proliferation ability. Sirt3 overexpression plasmid (OV-Sirt3) was transfected in PC-9 and A549 cells and treated with 1 \u00b5mol/L Gefitinib for 4 h and 10% CSE for 48 h after N-acetylcysteine (NAC) action. The expressions of Sirt3 and SOD2 were detected by Western blot; the ROS level in the cells was detected by DCFH-DA probe, and the cell activity was detected by CCK-8. CSE induced an increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of both PC-9 and A549 cells to Gefitinib (P<0.01) and enhanced the proliferation of PC-9 and A549 cells, suggesting that CS induced Gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.

CSE induced low expressions of Sirt3 and SOD2 (P<0.01), and Sirt3/SOD2 was associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients (P<0.05). OV-Sirt3 in PC-9 and A549 cells reversed CSE-induced Gefitinib resistance (P<0.05) and significantly reduced ROS production.

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have significantly prolonged survival in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, the development of resistance mechanisms prohibits the curative potential of EGFR TKIs. Combination therapies emerge as a valuable approach to preventing or delaying disease progression. Here, we investigated the combined inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and EGFR in TKI-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. The pharmacological inhibition of PLK1 destabilized EGFR levels and sensitized NSCLC cells to Osimertinib through induction of apoptosis. In addition, we found that c-Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase of EGFR, is a direct phosphorylation target of PLK1 and PLK1 impacts the stability of c-Cbl in a kinase-dependent manner. In conclusion, we describe a novel interaction between mutant EGFR and PLK1 that may be exploited in the clinic. Co-targeting PLK1 and EGFR may improve and prolong the clinical response to EGFR TKI in patients with an EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese herbal prescription Yi-Fei San-Jie pill (YFSJ) has been used for adjuvant treatment in patients with lung cancer for a long time. Reports have indicated that the combination of gefitinib (Gef) with YFSJ inhibits the proliferation of EGFR-TKI-resistant cell lines by enhancing cellular apoptosis and autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of YFSJ on EGFR-TKI resistance and related metabolic pathways remain to be explored. In our report, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), metabolomics, network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and biological analysis methods were used to investigate the mechanism. The UPLC-MS/MS data identified 42 active compounds of YFSJ extracts. YFSJ extracts can enhance the antitumor efficacy of Gef without hepatic and renal toxicity in vivo. The analysis of the metabolomics pathway enrichment revealed that YFSJ mainly affected the tyrosine metabolism pathway in rat models. Moreover, YFSJ has been shown to reverse Gef resistance and improve the effects of Gef on the cellular viability, migration capacity, and cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutations. The results of network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed that tyrosine metabolism-related active compounds of YFSJ affect EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC by targeting cell cycle and the MET/EGFR signaling pathway; these findings were validated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. YFSJ inhibits NSCLC by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase to suppress tumor growth, cell viability, and cell migration through synergistic effects with Gef via the tyrosine metabolic pathway and the EGFR/MET signaling pathway. To summarize, the findings of the current study indicate that YFSJ is a prospective complementary treatment for Gef-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IB-IIIA resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has limited benefit for improving cure rates. The proportion of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) alterations among patients with resected NSCLC is comparable to that observed in patients with advanced disease, and the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been demonstrated to prolong disease-free survival (DFS). With recent approval of osimertinib in this context, a focus on the rapidly evolving scenario and future perspective in clinical practice is needed and was the aim of the current review. Randomized phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated DFS benefit with adjuvant EGFR TKI therapy in patients with resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The most recent trial (ADAURA) assessed 3-year adjuvant osimertinib and showed consistent DFS benefit and a significant role of the intervention in preventing the occurrence of brain metastasis. However, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy, the appropriate duration of treatment, the management of disease relapse, and the effective cure rate remain undetermined. A deeper investigation on molecular biomarkers, covariant patterns, and dynamic monitoring of postsurgical circulating DNA would be helpful for the implementation of future strategies to further improve survival rates after adjuvant therapy for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Adjuvant osimertinib revolutionized the treatment algorithm for patients with stage IB-IIIA resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Further evidence driven by clinical issues will be key for further optimization of the goals of adjuvant treatment in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the standard first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitive EGFR mutations. The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) is an inflammation-assessing score based on C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations. Information regarding the association between the GPS and EGFR-TKI treatment effectiveness is limited; hence, we investigated whether the GPS can predict the response of NSCLC to EGFR-TKIs. We evaluated 340 patients with NSCLC harboring sensitive EGFR mutations who received EGFR-TKI monotherapy between March 2009 and July 2021. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). After a median follow-up of 26.6 months, patients with a GPS of 0, 1, and 2 had PFS of 15.7, 10.0, and 6.3 months, respectively, and OS of 40.1, 25.8, and 14.4 months, respectively; patients with a GPS of 0 had significantly better PFS and OS than those with a GPS of 1 (p = 0.03, p = 0.001, respectively) or 2 (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified poor performance status, stage 4 at diagnosis, type of EGFR-TKI (gefitinib/erlotinib vs. afatinib), and GPS = 2 as predictors of a short PFS. Meanwhile, poor performance status, gefitinib/erlotinib administration, and GPS = 2 were predictors of a short OS. The GPS predicted the survival of NSCLC patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations who were undergoing EGFR-TKI treatment. The GPS might be ideal for routine use in clinical practice, given that it is an easily calculated parameter.",

    "title": "Front-line therapy for brain metastases and non-brain metastases in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: a network meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The brain is a common metastatic site in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), resulting in a relatively poor prognosis. Systemic therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is recommended as the first-line treatment for EGFR -mutated, advanced NSCLC patients. However, intracranial activity varies in different drugs. Thus, brain metastasis (BM) should be considered when choosing the treatment regimens. We conducted this network meta-analysis to explore the optimal first-line therapeutic schedule for advanced EGFR -mutated NSCLC patients with different BM statuses. Randomized controlled trials focusing on EGFR-TKIs (alone or in combination) in advanced and EGFR -mutant NSCLC patients, who have not received systematic treatment, were systematically searched up to December 2021. We extracted and analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A network meta-analysis was performed with the Bayesian statistical model to determine the survival outcomes of all included therapy regimens using the R software. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare intervention measures, and overall rankings of therapies were estimated under the Bayesian framework. This analysis included 17 RCTs with 5077 patients and 12 therapies, including osimertinib + bevacizumab, aumolertinib, osimertinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, standards of care (SoC, including gefitinib, erlotinib, or icotinib), SoC + apatinib, SoC + bevacizumab, SoC + ramucirumab, SoC + pemetrexed based chemotherapy (PbCT), PbCT, and pemetrexed free chemotherapy (PfCT). For patients with BM, SoC + PbCT improved PFS compared with SoC (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.95), and osimertinib + bevacizumab was most likely to rank first in PFS, with a cumulative probability of 34.5%, followed by aumolertinib, with a cumulative probability of 28.3%. For patients without BM, osimertinib + bevacizumab, osimertinib, aumolertinib, SoC + PbCT, dacomitinib, SoC + ramucirumab, SoC + bevacizumab, and afatinib showed superior efficacy compared with SoC (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.20-0.90; HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.68; HR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.77; HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.38-0.66; HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.89; HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.44-0.94; HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.76; HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.00), PbCT (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.11-0.74; HR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15-0.62; HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.69; HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.18-0.64; HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.82; HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22-0.87; HR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.22-0.74; HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.31-0.75), and PfCT (HR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06-0.32; HR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.09-0.26; HR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29; HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.10-0.26; HR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.12-0.35; HR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.39; HR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.12-0.31; HR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.16-0.34) in terms of PFS. And, SoC + apatinib showed relatively superior PFS when compared with PbCT (HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.22-0.92) and PfCT (HR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.39), but similar PFS to SoC (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.42-1.03). No statistical differences were observed for PFS in patients without BM between PbCT and SoC (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.84-2.64), but both showed favorable PFS when compared with PfCT (PfCT vs. SoC, HR = 3.09, 95% CI: 2.06-4.55; PbCT vs. PfCT, HR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06-0.32). For patients without BM, osimertinib + bevacizumab was most likely to rank the first, with cumulative probabilities of 47.1%. For OS, SoC + PbCT was most likely to rank first in patients with and without BM, with cumulative probabilities of 46.8%, and 37.3%, respectively. Osimertinib + bevacizumab is most likely to rank first in PFS in advanced EGFR -mutated NSCLC patients with or without BM, and SoC + PbCT is most likely to rank first in OS.",

Cranial lesions with number \u2a7d3 and largest tumor size \u2a7d3\u2009cm at baseline and best response to EGFR-TKIs were defined as oligo-BMs and oligo-residual cranial disease (ORCD), respectively. To provide preliminary data supporting CLT, survival outcomes were compared in patients with ORCD, stratified by CLT status. Of the 216 patients enrolled, 57.1% had oligo-BMs and 24.5% received first-line osimertinib. At best response to the first-line EGFR-TKIs, intracranial complete response, partial response, and stable disease occurred in 18.5, 31.9, and 44.4% of the whole population, respectively. For patients without CLT ( Cranial progressive disease developed mostly at the residual cranial lesions in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with baseline BMs who received first-line EGFR-TKIs. Consolidative cranial local therapy targeting the oligo-residual cranial tumor lesions may provide survival benefit, which warrants future validation.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) showed great therapeutic efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, acquired resistance severely limits the clinical application and efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. In the current study, we found that solamargine (SM), a natural alkaloid derived from the fruit of Lycium tomato lobelia, has been found to inhibit the progression of NSCLC and enhance the anticancer effect of EGFR-TKIs. In brief, SM significantly inhibited the cell viability of NSCLC cells and enhanced the anticancer effect of gefitinib (GFTN) and erlotinib (ERL). Mechanistically, SM decreased the expression of MALAT1 and induced miR-141-3p, whereas reduced SP1 protein levels. Interestingly, both MALAT1 and Sp1 have classical and conservative binding sites of miR-141-3p in their 3'-UTR regions. Silence of MALAT1 and overexpression of miR-141-3p both decreased the protein expression of Sp1. Subsequently, promoter activity and protein expression of IGFBP1 were upregulated by SM, which was not observed in cells with SP1 overexpression. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of SM on cell growth was significantly blocked by knockdown of IGFBP1 expression. More importantly, the combination of SM and GFTN synergistically inhibited the progression of lung cancer. Similar results were observed in experiments in vivo. Finally, the clinical relevance of MALAT1, Sp1 and IGFBP1 was further validated using bioinformatics analysis. Taken together, we confirmed that SM significantly enhanced the anticancer effect of EGFR-TKIs by regulating the MALAT1/miR-141-3p/Sp1/IGFBP1 signaling pathway. This study unravels a novel mechanism and suggests a new potential NSCLC-associated therapy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of afatinib compared to that of osimertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who harbored uncommon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. A PubMed database-based literature review was conducted to retrieve related studies. Patients harboring EGFR mutations besides the deletion in exon 19 (19del) and point mutation of L858R were included in this analysis. The primary outcome events were the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Propensity score matching (PSM) at a ratio of 1:1 was used between afatinib and osimertinib groups to control the confounding factors. Uncommon EGFR mutations were categorized into 4 groups: insertion in exon 20 (ex20ins), non-ex20ins single uncommon EGFR mutations, compound EGFR mutations that with 19del or L858R, and compound EGFR mutations without 19del or L858R. After PSM, 71 patients in either the afatinib or osimertinib group were matched. The afatinib group had an ORR of 60.6%, slightly higher than the osimertinib group's (50.3%), the difference was not statistically significant (P\u2005=\u2005.610). However, the afatinib group showed a significantly superior PFS benefit than the osimertinib group (11.0 vs. 7.0 months, P\u2005=\u2005.044). In addition, patients harboring non-ex20ins single uncommon EGFR mutations yield the best ORR and PFS, following treatment of either afatinib (ORR: 76.7%, mPFS: 14.1 months) or osimertinib (ORR: 68.8%, mPFS: 15.1 months). Moreover, there was no significant difference in terms of ORR or PFS between the cohort of patients treated with afatinib or osimertinib, regardless of whether or not the patients had brain metastases. Both afatinib and osimertinib displayed favorable clinical activities toward uncommon EGFR mutations. Afatinib showed a more profound and durable PFS benefit than osimertinib, although no efficacy advantage was observed.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have a significant therapeutic effect in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. However, the acquired resistance greatly limits the survival benefit of EGFR-TKIs for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plus EGFR-TKIs in these patients. In this prospective, randomized, controlled, phase 2 study, participants were recruited from 4 different hospitals in Wuhan, China. Eligible patients were histologically confirmed to have NSCLC with an EGFR-sensitive mutation (19DEL or 21L858R) and diagnosed at stage IV. Patients who had received first-line EGFR-TKIs treatment including gefitinib, erlotinib, and icotinib and achieved stable disease or partial response were enrolled after three months. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SBRT plus EGFR-TKIs or EGFR-TKIs treatment alone. In the combination-group, different tumor sites were irradiated at doses ranging from 30-50\u00a0Gy in five fractions. Considering the short duration of SBRT, the TKIs were continued during the radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, with the registration number of NCT03595644. Between May 4, 2018 and Dec 20, 2019, 74 patients were screened, of whom 62 patients were enrolled and randomized. The study was closed early with 62/72 patients due to slow accrual. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive SBRT plus EGFR-TKI(n\u00a0=\u00a031) or EGFR-TKI alone (n\u00a0=\u00a031). One patient who was randomized to the SBRT plus EGFR-TKI group refused to receive SBRT during the treatment, and, 61 patients were included the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis, with 30 in the SBRT plus EGFR-TKI and 31 in the EGFR-TKI group. As of the clinical cutoff date (Feb 14, 2022), the median follow-up was 29.4\u00a0months (IQR 6.9-38.9). The median PFS of the EGFR-TKI group and SBRT combination group was 9.0 vs 17.6\u00a0months (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.31-0.89, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Meanwhile, the median OS was 23.2 vs 33.6\u00a0months (HR [95%CI], 0.53(0.30-0.95); P\u00a0=\u00a00.026). There was no grade 3 or greater toxicity observed in either group, the grade 2 adverse events were 50% in the EGFR-TKIs\u00a0+\u00a0SBRT group while the percentage was 45.2% in the EGFR-TKIs\u00a0group. The addition of SBRT significantly delayed the onset of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and prolonged the PFS and OS of patients. Radiotherapy of the primary lesion alone might be superior to metastatic sites. Further confirmatory studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

We analyzed the disease progression during osimertinib treatment to identify potential treatment strategies. We identified advanced NSCLC patients who commenced osimertinib treatment after progression on previous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) from June 2014 to November 2018 from electronic records. Patients' tumor characteristics, efficacy outcomes, affected organs from radiology studies, and treatment modalities before and after osimertinib were analyzed. Eighty-four patients were included. At osimertinib initiation, bone (50.0%) and brain (41.9%) were the commonest single metastatic sites, whereas thoracic involvement (73.3%) was more frequent than bone (27.4%) or brain (20.2%) metastasis during disease progression on osimertinib. Oligo-progressive disease (PD) and central nervous system (CNS)-sanctuary PD were observed in 15 (17.9%) and 3 (3.6%) patients, respectively. Most patients without brain metastasis (BM) at osimertinib initiation remained BM-free (46/49, 93.9%), and 60% of patients (21/35) with pre-existing BM showed intracranial disease control despite extracranial PD. The resistance mechanisms to osimertinib were explored in 23 patients (27.4%), and T790M-loss was observed in 14 patients (60.9%) who had worse survival outcomes than those without T790M-loss (progression-free survival, 5.4 vs. 16.5\u2009months, p\u2009=\u20090.02; overall survival, not reached, p\u2009=\u20090.03). PD during osimertinib treatment occurred preferentially in the thorax and pre-existing sites. Extracranial PD prevailed over intracranial PD regardless of baseline BM and prior brain radiation. These results support osimertinib's intracranial efficacy and may guide treatment strategies for EGFR-mutated NSCLC with BM.",

    "abstract": "Precision cancer medicine has changed the treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as illustrated by the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) towards mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, as responses to EGFR-TKIs are heterogenous among NSCLC patients, there is a need for ways to early monitor changes in treatment response in a non-invasive way e.g., in patient's blood samples. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as a source of tumor biomarkers which could improve on non-invasive liquid biopsy-based diagnosis of cancer. However, the heterogeneity in EVs is high. Putative biomarker candidates may be hidden in the differential expression of membrane proteins in a subset of EVs hard to identify using bulk techniques. Using a fluorescence-based approach, we demonstrate that a single-EV technique can detect alterations in EV surface protein profiles. We analyzed EVs isolated from an EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line, which is refractory to EGFR-TKIs erlotinib and responsive to osimertinib, before and after treatment with these drugs and after cisplatin chemotherapy. We studied expression level of five proteins; two tetraspanins (CD9, CD81), and three markers of interest in lung cancer (EGFR, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)). The data reveal alterations induced by the osimertinib treatment compared to the other two treatments. These include the growth of the PD-L1/HER2-positive EV population, with the largest increase in vesicles exclusively expressing one of the two proteins. The expression level per EV decreased for these markers. On the other hand, both the TKIs had a similar effect on the EGFR-positive EV population.",

Gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer caused by mesenchymal-epidermal transition factor (Met) overexpression and hyperactivation was investigated as a proof-of-concept. Unlike the traditional single-factor investigation, the proposed approach evaluated the contribution of three important parameters towards the resistance, including the changes of Met expression level, the homodimerization of Met with itself and the heterodimerization of Met with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A multiple regression model based on these three parameters was tentatively established for evaluation of the resistance level of laboratory-developed resistant cells and evaluation of the resistance level of patient-derived cells. Such an approach facilitates a quick identification of a drug resistance, to evaluate not only the resistance level but also the resistance mechanism.",

All of the 16 studies reported their findings about overall survival (OS), and 15 of them also reported findings about progression-free survival (PFS). The NMA results showed that there was no significant difference in OS among the 6 treatment regimens. It was observed that erlotinib had the highest likelihood of obtaining the best OS, followed by afatinib, gefitinib, icotinib, CTX, and cetuximab, in descending order. This indicates that the highest possibility of achieving the best OS was with erlotinib, while the lowest was with cetuximab. The NMA results also showed that the PFS achieved with treatment using afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib were all higher than that with treatment using CTX, with statistically significant differences. The results showed that there was no significant difference in PFS among erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, cetuximab, and icotinib. CTX, cetuximab, icotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib were ranked in descending order based on the PFS indicator SUCRA values, which implied that erlotinib had the highest possibility in achieving the best PFS, while CTX had the lowest.

    "title": "Healthcare Resource Utilization and Costs in Patients with EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Treatment in the United States: An Insurance Claims-Based Descriptive Analysis.",
    "abstract": "An estimated 10-15% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases present with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFRm). While EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as osimertinib have become first-line (1L) standard of care for these patients, limited chemotherapy use still occurs in real-world practice. Studies of healthcare resource use (HRU) and cost of care provide a means by which the value of various treatment regimens, healthcare efficiency, and disease burden can be assessed. These studies are important for population health decision makers and health systems that prioritize value-based care to drive population health. The aim of this study was to descriptively assess HRU and costs among patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC initiating 1L therapy in the United States. IBM MarketScan Research Databases (January 1, 2017 to April 30, 2020) were used to identify adult patients with advanced NSCLC, based on a diagnosis for lung cancer (LC) and initiation of 1L therapy or diagnosis of metastases within 30 days of the first LC diagnosis. All patients had \u2265 12 months of continuous insurance eligibility prior to the first LC diagnosis and initiated (in 2018 or after) an EGFR-TKI during any line of therapy to proxy EGFRm status. Per-patient-per-month all-cause HRU and costs were described during 1L for patients initiating 1L osimertinib or chemotherapy. A total of 213 patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC were identified (mean age at 1L initiation: 60.9 years; 69.0% female). In 1L, 66.2% initiated osimertinib, 21.1% chemotherapy, and 12.7% another regimen. Mean 1L therapy duration was 8.8 months (osimertinib) and 7.6 months (chemotherapy), respectively. Among osimertinib recipients, 28% had an inpatient admission, 40% an emergency room (ER) visit, and 99% an outpatient visit. Among chemotherapy recipients, these proportions were 22%, 31%, and 100%. Mean monthly all-cause healthcare costs among osimertinib and chemotherapy patients were US$27,174 and US$23,343, respectively. Among osimertinib recipients, drug-related costs (including pharmacy and outpatient antineoplastic drug and administration costs) made up 61% (US$16,673) of total costs, inpatient costs 20% (US$5462), and other outpatient costs 16% (US$4432). In chemotherapy recipients, 59% (US$13,883) of total costs were drug-related, 5% (US$1166) were inpatient costs, and 33% (US$7734) other outpatient costs. Higher mean total cost of care was observed among patients receiving 1L TKI (osimertinib) than 1L chemotherapy in EGFRm advanced NSCLC. However, descriptive differences in type of spending and HRU were identified: higher inpatient costs and inpatient days for osimertinib versus higher outpatient costs for chemotherapy. Findings suggest that significant unmet needs may remain for 1L treatment of EGFRm NSCLC, and despite significant advances in targeted care, further individualized therapies are needed to balance benefits, risks, and total cost of care. Furthermore, observed descriptive differences in inpatient admissions may have implications for quality of care and patient quality of life, for which additional research is warranted.",

    "title": "Metabolic Reprogramming Driven by IGF2BP3 Promotes Acquired Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Acquired resistance represents a bottleneck for effective molecular targeted therapy in lung cancer. Metabolic adaptation is a distinct hallmark of human lung cancer that might contribute to acquired resistance. In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) mediated by IGF2BP3-dependent cross-talk between epigenetic modifications and metabolic reprogramming through the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis. IGF2BP3 was upregulated in patients with TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer, and high IGF2BP3 expression correlated with reduced overall survival. Upregulated expression of the RNA binding protein IGF2BP3 in lung cancer cells reduced sensitivity to TKI treatment and exacerbated the development of drug resistance via promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). COX6B2 mRNA bound IGF2BP3, and COX6B2 was required for increased OXPHOS and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by IGF2BP3. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 bound to the 3'-untranslated region of COX6B2 in an m6A-dependent manner to increase COX6B2 mRNA stability. Moreover, the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis regulated nicotinamide metabolism, which can alter OXPHOS and promote EGFR-TKI acquired resistance. Inhibition of OXPHOS with IACS-010759, a small-molecule inhibitor, resulted in strong growth suppression in vitro and in vivo in a gefitinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft model. Collectively, these findings suggest that metabolic reprogramming by the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis plays a critical role in TKI resistance and confers a targetable metabolic vulnerability to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer. IGF2BP3 stabilizes COX6B2 to increase oxidative phosphorylation and to drive resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer, which provides a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance by targeting metabolic transitions.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detectable driver mutations have now changed the course of lung cancer treatment with the emergence of targeted therapy as a novel strategy that widely improved lung cancer prognosis, especially in metastatic patients. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is an irreversible third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) used to treat stage IV EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer. It was initially designed to target both EGFR-activating mutations and the EGFR T790M mutation as well, which is the most common resistance mechanism to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Following the FLAURA trial, osimertinib is now widely used in the first-line setting. However, resistance to osimertinib inevitably develops, with numerous mechanisms leading to its resistance, classified into two main categories: EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent mechanisms. While EGFR-dependent mechanisms consist mainly of the C797S EGFR mutation, EGFR-independent mechanisms include bypass pathways, oncogenic fusions, and phenotypic transformation, among others. This review summarizes the molecular resistance mechanisms to osimertinib, with the aim of identifying novel therapeutic approaches to overcome osimertinib resistance and improve patient outcome.",

This study evaluated the single MET inhibition in these specific tumours. We investigated the efficacy of a single MET inhibitor in EGFR-mutant, MET-amplified lung cancer cells (HCC827GR) and the matched clinical cases and patient-derived cells. Acquired resistance mechanisms to single MET inhibitor were further explored. Single MET inhibitor sufficiently inhibited the EGFR downstream signalling and proliferation in the HCC827GR cells. The MET-inhibitor-sensitive clones had similar EGFR mutation allele frequency as the MET-inhibitor-resistant clones. The patients with EGFR-mutant, MET-amplified lung cancer resistant to EGFR inhibitors showed definite response to single MET inhibitor but the response duration was not durable. The MET gene copy number in their plasma circulating tumour DNA was significantly decreased during the treatment and was not re-increased after progression. In the cells resistant to single MET inhibitor, the EGFR pathway was reactivated, and gefitinib alone successfully suppressed their growth. Single MET inhibition produced a short-lived response in EGFR-mutant and MET-amplified lung cancer. A further study of a novel combination therapy schedule is needed to achieve long-lasting efficacy and less toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The application of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib, has shifted lung cancer treatment from empirical chemotherapy to targeted molecular therapy. However, acquired drug resistance is inevitable in almost all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with gefitinib. Combined treatment with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and gefitinib produced a better inhibitory effect on lung adenocarcinoma than gefitinib treatment alone; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the underlying mechanism of this combination treatment. We prepared gefitinib-resistant A549 cells and investigated whether apoptosis and ferroptosis were involved in the sensitizing effect of DHA. Treatment with 5\u2009\u03bcM gefitinib resulted in rupturing and floatation of A549 cells in the medium, while A549-GR cells were found to be insusceptible to gefitinib. However, treatment with DHA substantially inhibited the proliferation of A549-GR cells in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by increased apoptosis and ferroptosis. The accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) was crucial for the inhibitory effect of DHA on A549-GR cells. Moreover, cellular autophagy was significantly upregulated post-DHA treatment. The combined treatment of DHA and gefitinib resulted in inhibition of proliferation of A549, H1975, and HCC827 cells, and ROS accumulation and a remarkable induction of apoptosis was observed in A549-GR cells. DHA significantly induced apoptosis and ferroptosis in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited high cellular toxicity on A549-GR cells when combined with gefitinib.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that the combined application of Ephedra Herb extract (EHE) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib, is effective in suppressing the growth of erlotinib-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, H1993, xenograft tumor, and cell proliferation, and that EHE downregulates c-Met and wild-type EGFR in H1993 cells. However, it was unclear whether EHE could affect EGFR with active mutations. Clinically, advanced NSCLC patients who are eligible for EGFR-TKI treatment are those with detected EGFR with activating mutations. Therefore, it is important to clarify the effect of EHE on EGFR with activating mutations. H1975 cells express EGFR with activating mutations, L858R and T790M, and c-Met; this NSCLC cell line was used in the present study. EHE downregulated the expression of EGFR with activating mutations and c-Met, and inhibited autophosphorylation of c-Met. Proliferation of H1975 cells was suppressed by EHE in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that EHE may be effective against NSCLC harboring EGFR with activating mutations. Considering the fact that advanced NSCLC patients, with an EGFR T790M mutation, are currently widely treated with the third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib, we examined the combined effects of osimertinib and EHE on H1975 cells. The osimertinib and EHE combination downregulated the expression of these receptors and suppressed the proliferation of H1975 cells more effectively than did osimertinib alone, suggesting that this combination may be effective in treating patients with advanced NSCLC with the L858R\u2009+\u2009T790M EGFR mutation and c-Met.

Unfortunately, resistance to osimertinib inevitably develops during the treatment and therefore limits its long-term effectiveness. For both fundamental and clinical researchers, it stands for a major challenge to reveal the mechanism, and a dire need to develop novel therapeutics to overcome the resistance.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (EGFRm) represent one of the most common genomic alterations identified among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several targeted agents for patients with EGFRm have been proven safe and effective, including the third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib. Nonetheless, some patients will present with or develop EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms. We characterized the genomic landscape of primary resistance to osimertinib among Hispanic patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. An observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted with two groups of patients, those with intrinsic resistance (cohort A) and those with long-term survival (cohort B). All patients were treated and followed between January 2018 and May 2022. All patients were assessed for\u00a0Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and Bcl-2-like protein 11 (BIM)/AXL mRNA expression before starting TKI. After 8 weeks of treatment, a liquid biopsy was performed to determine the presence of circulating free DNA (cfDNA), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify mutations at the time of progression. In both cohorts, overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. We found a homogeneous distribution of EGFR-sensitizing mutations in both cohorts. For cohort A, exon 21 mutations were more common than exon 19 deletions (ex19dels) for cohort B (P = 0.0001). The reported ORR for osimertinib was 6.3% and 100% for cohorts A and B, respectively (P = 0.0001). PFS was significantly higher in cohort B (27.4 months vs. 3.1 months; P = 0.0001) and ex19del patients versus L858R (24.5 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.2-NR), vs. 7.6 months, 95% CI 4.8-21.1; P = 0.001). OS was considerably lower for cohort A (20.1 months vs. 36.0 months; P = 0.0001) and was better for patients with ex19del, no brain metastasis, and low tumor mutation burden. At the time of progression, more mutations were found in cohort A, identifying off-target alterations more frequently, including TP53, RAS, and RB1. EGFR-independent alterations are common among patients with primary resistance to osimertinib and significantly impact PFS and OS. Our results suggest that among Hispanic patients, other variables associated with intrinsic resistance include the number of commutations, high levels AXL mRNA, and low levels of BIM mRNA, T790M de novo, EGFR p.L858R presence, and a high tumoral mutational burden.",

Treatment-na\u00efve NSCLC patients with brain metastasis harboring EGFR-activating mutations were treated with osimertinib 80\u2009mg oral daily and bevacizumab 15\u2009mg/kg intravenously on day 1, repeated every 21\u2009days, until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was the median progression-free survival (mPFS), and the secondary endpoints were the median overall survival (mOS), response rates, and toxicities. This study has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05104281) and is ongoing. A total of 52 Chinese patients were enrolled, of whom 17 harbored EGFR 19 del and 35 harbored EGFR L858R mutation. The objective response rate (ORR) was 75.0% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 96.2%; the mPFS was 17.0\u2009months (95% CI: 11.46-22.54), while the mOS was not reached. The mPFS was 20.0\u2009months (95% CI: 14.56-25.44) and was 17.0\u2009months (95% CI: 13.28-20.72) for patients harboring EGFR 19 del and EGFR L858R mutation (p\u2009=\u20090.844), respectively. The intracranial ORR was 82.7%, and the intracranial mPFS was 22.0\u2009months (95% CI: 2.92-41.08).The main adverse events were mild-to-moderate hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, hypertension, and proteinuria. Three patients developed grade III proteinuria, while five patients developed grade III hypertension; they permanently discontinued bevacizumab treatment. Osimertinib combined with bevacizumab shows promising results in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with brain metastasis, and the side effects are tolerable.",

However, TAPO related to other EGFR-TKI has not been reported. Here, we reported a case of TAPO related to afatinib in lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation. A 64-year-old male had the diagnosis of stage IV (The 7th edition of the staging system by the Union for International Cancer Control) lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR del 19 mutation. He received afatinib 40 mg per day from May 2015. Partial response was achieved, though the dose was reduced to 30 mg per day due to grade 3 rash. In January 2016, CT showed ground glass opacity in the right middle lobe, which resolved spontaneously 2 weeks later. He had no symptom and laboratory findings were not remarkable. Thereafter, recurrent GGO was revealed with chest CT, but all opacity improved without any medication (i.e., corticosteroids) or stopping afatinib. Therefore, we diagnosed a series of opacity as recurrent TAPO with afatinib. TAPO could occur with EGFR-TKI other than osimertinib. Further study is needed to establish the management of new opacity suggesting TAPO under EGFR-TKI treatment.",

    "abstract": "Acquired RET fusions have been reported at resistance to treatment with EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, a multicenter cohort of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers treated with osimertinib and selpercatinib for RET fusion-mediated osimertinib resistance has not previously been published. Patients who received selpercatinib in combination with osimertinib on a prospective expanded access clinical trial (NCT03906331) and single-patient compassionate use programs across five countries were centrally analyzed. All patients had advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC with a RET fusion detected from tissue or plasma following osimertinib therapy. Clinicopathologic and outcomes data were collected. Fourteen patients with EGFR-mutant and RET fusion-positive lung cancers who experienced prior progression on osimertinib received osimertinib and selpercatinib. EGFR exon 19 deletions (\u00b1T790M, 86%) and non-KIF5B fusions (CCDC6-RET 50%, NCOA4-RET 36%) predominated. Osimertinib 80 mg daily and selpercatinib 80 mg twice daily were the most commonly administered dosages. The response rate, disease control rate, and median treatment duration were 50% [95% confidence interval (CI), 25%-75%, n = 12], 83% (95% CI, 55%-95%), and 7.9 months (range, 0.8-25+), respectively. Resistance was complex, involving EGFR on-target (EGFR C797S), RET on-target (RET G810S), and off-target (EML4-ALK/STRN-ALK, KRAS G12S, BRAF V600E) mechanisms; RET fusion loss; or polyclonal mechanisms. For patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with an acquired RET fusion as a mechanism of EGFR inhibitor resistance, the addition of selpercatinib to osimertinib was feasible and safe and offered clinical benefit, supporting the prospective evaluation of this combination.

    "abstract": "Alamar Blue (AB) has become an increasingly popular reagent of choice for cell viability assays. We chose AB over other reagents such as MTT and Cell-Titer Glo due to its cost effectiveness and its ability to be a nondestructive assay. While analyzing the effect of osimertinib, an EGFR inhibitor on the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, PC-9, we noticed unexpected right-shifts of dose response curves as compared to the curve obtained by Cell Titer Glo assay. Here, we describe our modified AB assay method to avoid right shift right shift in dose response curve. Unlike some of the redox drugs that were reported to directly affected AB reading, osimertinib itself did not directly increase AB reading. Yet, the removal of the drug containing medium prior to AB addition eliminated falsely increased reading giving comparable dose response curve as the one determined by Cell Titer Glo assay. When a panel of 11 drugs were assessed, we found that this modified AB assay eliminated unexpected similar right shifts detected in other epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. We also found that plate-to-plate variability can be minimized by adding an appropriate concentration of rhodamine B solution to the assay plates to calibrate fluorimeter sensitivity. This calibration method also enables a continuous longitudinal assay to monitor cell growth or recovery from drug toxicity over time. Our new modified AB assay is expected to provide accurate ",

Few studies have directly compared analysis platforms in terms of their diagnostic performance in analyzing ctDNA obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). We prospectively analyzed patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC who were subjected to CSF analysis for suspected LM. To detect EGFR mutations, CSF ctDNA was analyzed using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). CSF samples from osimertinib-refractory patients with LM were also subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS). Significantly higher rates of valid results (95.1% vs. 78%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and EGFR common mutation detection (94.3% vs. 77.1%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.047) were obtained through ddPCR than through the cobas EGFR Mutation Test. The sensitivities of ddPCR and cobas were 94.3% and 75.6%, respectively. The concordance rate for EGFR mutation detection through ddPCR and the cobas EGFR Mutation Test was 75.6% and that for EGFR mutation detection in CSF and plasma ctDNA was 28.1%. In osimertinib-resistant CSF samples, all original EGFR mutations were detected through NGS. MET amplification and CCDC6-RET fusion were demonstrated in one patient each (9.1%). The cobas EGFR Mutation Test, ddPCR, and NGS appear to be feasible methods for analyzing CSF ctDNA in patients with NSCLC and LM. In addition, NGS may provide comprehensive information regarding the mechanisms underlying osimertinib resistance.",

Afatinib, gefitinib, osimertinib, and carboplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy were the treatments he received. At the 15th month of osimertinib therapy, the patient developed QTc prolongation. Two weeks after the first incidence of QTc prolongation, electrocardiography showed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. In addition to his atrial fibrillation, echocardiography revealed severely impaired left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction: 30%). Baseline to osimertinib, an electrocardiography investigation was carried out as per the protocol. Baseline drug history was reviewed and rosuvastatin was discontinued before initiating osimertinib as both drugs contribute to QTc prolongation. Dabigatran, bisoprolol, and digoxin were started for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Ramipril and spironolactone were prescribed for the treatment of heart failure but osimertinib continued uneventfully. The patient died of non-small cell lung cancer. Recommendations for practical and clinically relevant baseline and on-treatment assessments are considered which may reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity during osimertinib therapy.

This method was successfully applied to measure plasma (n\u00a0=\u00a044) and CSF (n\u00a0=\u00a06) concentrations of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients. The chromatographic separation was achieved by a Hypersil Gold aQ column within 3\u00a0min. The median plasma concentrations were 325.76, 1981.50, 42.62, 40.27, and 340.92\u00a0ng/ml for gefitinib erlotinib, afatinib 30\u00a0mg/day, afatinib 40\u00a0mg/day, and osimertinib, respectively. The CSF penetration rates were 2.15% for the patients receiving erlotinib therapy, 0.59% for afatinib, 0.08-1.12% for osimertinib 80\u00a0mg/day, and 2.18% for those receiving osimertinib 160\u00a0mg/day. This assay helps to predict the effectiveness and toxicities of EGFR-TKIs in the pursuit of precision medicine for lung cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations have a poor prognosis and few therapeutic alternatives. We conducted a review of scientific evidence about therapies in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. A systematic review in PubMed\u00ae database was performed up to November 19, 2022. Clinical trials (CTs) about treatments of patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC harbouring EGFR exon 20 insertions who had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy were selected. CTs with a sample size of less than 10 patients were discarded. Efficacy results were used to determine the most interesting drugs. Subsequently, a more exhaustive analysis of the design of the CTs and safety of the most interesting schemes was conducted. Comparisons were attempted to develop. A total of 40 records were found in the systematic search. Twelve selected CTs included the following therapies: poziotinib, osimertinib, pertuzumab-trastuzumab-docetaxel scheme, mobocertinib, amivantamab, erlotinib-onalespib regimen, luminespib, ado-trastuzumab emtansine and dacomitinib. Mobocertinib, amivantamab and poziotinib were determined as the most interesting treatments according to efficacy data. Gastrointestinal and dermatological adverse reactions were relevant in these regimens. All CTs presented a non-randomised design. No reliable comparisons could be developed. The efficacy of mobocertinib, amivantamab and poziotinib in NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations is promising. However, therapies were assessed in single-arm CTs with low-quality evidence. Comparative studies with more extensive patient follow-up, larger sample size and better design are needed to reliably quantify the effect of these drugs.",

The clinical efficacy of osimertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring L747_A750>P and other uncommon ex19dels is not known. The AACR GENIE database was interrogated to characterize the frequency of individual ex19dels relative to other variants, and a multicenter retrospective cohort was used to compare clinical outcomes for patients with tumors harboring E746_A750del, L747_A750>P, and other uncommon ex19dels who received osimertinib in the first line (1L) or in second or later lines of therapy and were T790M+ (\u22652L). ex19dels comprised 45% of EGFR mutations, with 72 distinct variants ranging in frequency from 28.1% (E746_A750del) to 0.03%, with L747_A750>P representing 1.8% of the EGFR mutant cohort. In our multi-institutional cohort (N = 200), E746_A750del was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with 1L osimertinib versus L747_A750>P [median 21.3 months (95% confidence interval, 17.0-31.7) vs. 11.7 months (10.8-29.4); adjusted HR 0.52 (0.28-0.98); P = 0.043]. Osimertinib efficacy in patients with other uncommon ex19dels varied on the basis of the specific mutation present. The ex19del L747_A750>P is associated with inferior PFS compared with the common E746_A750del mutation in patients treated with 1L osimertinib. Understanding differences in osimertinib efficacy among EGFR ex19del subtypes could alter management of these patients in the future.",

Investigating the activity and safety of osimertinib in patients with EGFR exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S768I, or exon 21 L861Q mutations is of clinical interest. Patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer with confirmed EGFR exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S768I, or exon 21 L861Q mutations were eligible. Patients were required to have measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients were required to be EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive. The primary objective was objective response rate, and secondary objectives were progression-free survival, safety, and overall survival. The study used a two-stage design with a plan to enroll 17 patients in the first stage, and the study was terminated after the first stage due to slow accrual. Between May 2018 and March 2020, 17 patients were enrolled and received study therapy. The median age of patients was 70 years (interquartile range 62-76), the majority were female (n\u00a0= 11), had a performance status of 1 (n\u00a0= 10), and five patients had brain metastases at baseline. The objective response rate was 47% [95% confidence interval (CI) 23% to 72%], and the radiographic responses observed were partial response (n\u00a0= 8), stable disease (n\u00a0= 8), and progressive disease (n\u00a0= 1). The median progression-free survival was 10.5 months (95% CI 5.0-15.2 months), and the median OS was 13.8 months (95% CI 7.3-29.2 months). The median duration on treatment was 6.1 months (range 3.6-11.9 months), and the most common adverse events (regardless of attribution) were diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and dyspnea.

    "abstract": "The role of Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in predicting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKIs) efficacy remains controversial. Recent studies have highlighted that tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 signaling can be modulated by STAT3, AKT, MET oncogenic pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or BIM expression. This study aimed to investigate whether these underlying mechanisms affect the prognostic role of PD-L1. We retrospectively enrolled patients with EGFR mutant advanced stage NSCLC who received first-line EGFR-TKI between January 2017 and June 2019, the treatment efficacy of EGFR-TKI was assessed. Kaplan-Meier analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) revealed that patients with high BIM expression had shorter PFS, regardless of PD-L1 expression. This result was also supported by the COX proportional hazard regression analysis. In vitro, we further proved that the knockdown of BIM, instead of PDL1, induced more cell apoptosis following gefitinib treatment. Our data suggest that among the pathways affecting tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 signaling, BIM is potentially the underlying mechanism that affects the role of PD-L1 expression in predicting response to EGFR TKI and mediates cell apoptosis under treatment with gefitinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Further prospective studies are required to validate these results.",

However, MET amplification/overexpression is a common acquired osimertinib resistance mechanism. Savolitinib is an oral, potent, and highly selective MET-TKI; preliminary data suggest that combining osimertinib with savolitinib may overcome MET-driven resistance. A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model with EGFRm, MET-amplified NSCLC was tested with a fixed osimertinib dose [10 mg/kg for exposures equivalent to (\u2248)80 mg], combined with doses of savolitinib (0-15 mg/kg, \u22480-600 mg once daily), both with 1-aminobenzotriazole (to better match clinical half-life). After 20 days of oral dosing, samples were taken at various time points to follow the time course of drug exposure in addition to phosphorylated MET and EGFR (pMET and pEGFR) change. Population pharmacokinetics, savolitinib concentration versus percentage inhibition from baseline in pMET, and the relationship between pMET and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) were also modeled. As single agents, savolitinib (15 mg/kg) showed significant antitumor activity, reaching \u223c84% TGI, and osimertinib (10 mg/kg) showed no significant antitumor activity (34% TGI, P > 0.05 vs. vehicle). Upon combination, at a fixed dose of osimertinib, significant savolitinib dose-related antitumor activity was shown, ranging from 81% TGI (0.3 mg/kg) to 84% tumor regression (15 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling showed that the maximum inhibition of both pEGFR and pMET increased with increasing savolitinib doses.

However, heterogeneous benefit from EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy demands further biomarker exploration for patient selection. Previously, we identified certain TCR sequences with predictive value for adjuvant therapies from the CTONG1104 trial and found a relationship between the TCR repertoire and genetic variations. It remains unknown which TCR sequences could further enhance the prediction for only adjuvant EGFR-TKI. In this study, 57 tumor and 12 tumor-adjacent samples, respectively, from gefitinib-treated patients in the CTONG1104 were collected for TCR \u03b2 gene sequencing. We attempted to constitute a predictive model for prognosis and favorable adjuvant EGFR-TKI outcome for patients with early-stage NSCLC and EGFR mutations. The TCR rearrangements demonstrated significant prediction for overall survival (OS). A combined model of high frequent V\u03b27-3J\u03b22-5 and V\u03b224-1J\u03b22-1 with lower frequent V\u03b25-6J\u03b22-7 and V\u03b228J\u03b22-2 constituted the best value for predicting OS (P\u2009<\u20090.001; Hazard Ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20099.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.27 to 41.12) or DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.02; HR\u2009=\u20092.61, 95% CI: 1.13 to 6.03).

Here we present the rationale and study design for ADAURA2 (NCT05120349), which will evaluate adjuvant osimertinib vs. placebo in patients with stage IA2-IA3 EGFRm NSCLC, following complete tumor resection.

Patients will be adults aged \u226518 years with resected primary nonsquamous NSCLC stage IA2 or IA3 and central confirmation of an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation. Patients will be stratified by pathologic risk of disease recurrence (high vs. low), EGFR mutation type (exon 19 deletion vs. L858R) and race (Chinese Asian vs. non-Chinese Asian vs. non-Asian), and randomized 1:1 to receive osimertinib 80 mg once daily (QD) or placebo QD until disease recurrence, treatment discontinuation, or a maximum treatment duration of 3 years. The primary endpoint of this study is disease-free survival (DFS) in the high-risk stratum. Secondary endpoints include DFS in the overall population, overall survival, CNS DFS, and safety. Health-related quality of life and pharmacokinetics will also be evaluated. Study enrolment began in February 2022 and interim results of the primary endpoint are expected in August 2027.",

    "title": "[Initial Treatment of Aumolertinib in Combination with Bevacizumab for Advanced NSCLC with Primary EGFR T790M Mutation: A Report of Three Cases and Literature Review].",
    "abstract": "With the development of sequencing technology, the detection rate of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation is increasing. However, the first-line treatment for primary EGFR T790M-mutated NSCLC still lacks standard recommendations. Here, we reported three advanced NSCLC cases with EGFR-activating mutation and primary T790M mutation. The patients were initially treated with Aumolertinib combination with Bevacizumab; among which, one case was discontinued Bevacizumab due to bleeding risk after treatment for three months. Treatment was switched to Osimertinib after ten months of treatment. Another case switched to Osimertinib and discontinued Bevacizumab after thirteen months of treatment. The best effect response in all three cases was partial response (PR) after initial treatment. Two cases progressed after first-line treatment and progression-free survival (PFS) was eleven months and seven months respectively. The other one patient had persistent response after treatment, and the treatment duration has reached nineteen months. Two cases had multiple brain metastases before administration and the best response to intracranial lesions was PR. The intracranial PFS was fourteen months and not reached (16+ months), respectively. There were no new adverse events (AEs), and no AEs of grade three or above were reported. In addition, we summarized the research progress of Osimertinib in the treatment of NSCLC with primary EGFR T790M mutation. In conclusion, Aumolertinib combined with Bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced NSCLC with primary EGFR T790M mutation has a high objective response rate (ORR) and control ability of intracranial lesions, which can be used as one of the initial options for first-line advanced NSCLC with primary EGFR T790M mutation.\u2029. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u963f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u2029\u4f34\u539f\u53d1EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8\uff1a3\u4f8b\u75c5\u6848\u62a5\u9053\u2029\u53ca\u6587\u732e\u590d\u4e60\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u4f34\u539f\u53d1\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff08epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR\uff09T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u5bf9\u539f\u53d1EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8NSCLC\u7684\u4e00\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u5c1a\u65e0\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u6211\u4eec\u62a5\u9053\u4e863\u4f8b\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u4f34EGFR\u654f\u611f\u7a81\u53d8\u53ca\u539f\u53d1T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c3\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u4e00\u7ebf\u521d\u6cbb\u5747\u4e3a\u963f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c1\u4f8b\u5728\u6cbb\u75973\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u56e0\u51fa\u8840\u98ce\u9669\u505c\u7528\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u5e76\u4e8e10\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u66f4\u6362\u4e3a\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\uff1b1\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u6cbb\u759713\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u66f4\u6362\u4e3a\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u5e76\u505c\u7528\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u30023\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u6700\u4f73\u7597\u6548\u5747\u8fbe\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff08partial response, PR\uff09\u3002\u968f\u8bbf\u81f32022\u5e7410\u6708\uff0c2\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u4e00\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u8fdb\u5c55\u751f\u5b58\u671f\uff08progression-free survival, PFS\uff09\u5206\u522b\u4e3a11\u4e2a\u6708\u548c7\u4e2a\u6708\uff1b1\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u65f6\u95f4\u5df2\u8fbe19\u4e2a\u6708\u30022\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f34\u6709\u591a\u53d1\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e00\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u9885\u5185\u75c5\u7076\u6700\u4f73\u7597\u6548\u5747\u4e3aPR\uff0c\u9885\u5185PFS\u5206\u522b\u4e3a14\u4e2a\u6708\u548c\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\uff0816+\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u30023\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u671f\u95f4\u672a\u89c1\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u751f3\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0d\u826f\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86NSCLC\u4f34\u539f\u53d1EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u963f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u521d\u59cb\u6cbb\u7597\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u4f34\u539f\u53d1EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff08objective response rate, ORR\uff09\u53ca\u9885\u5185\u75c5\u7076\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u665a\u671fNSCLC\u4f34\u539f\u53d1EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u4e00\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u963f\u7f8e\u66ff\u5c3c\uff1b\u539f\u53d1T790M\u7a81\u53d8\uff1b\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\uff1b\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\u3011.",

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for these TKIs has become a standard and essential procedure. Dried plasma spots (DPS) was choosen for microsampling strategies for TDM, allowing easy and cost-effective logistics in many settings. This study developd and validated an assay for the simultaneous quantitative determination of gefitinib, osimertinib and icotinib in DPS by online solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-LC-MS) system. The TKIs were extracted from DPS with methanol and enriched on a Welch Polar-RP SPE column (30\u00a0\u00d7 4.6\u00a0mm, 5\u00a0\u00b5m), followed by separation on Waters X Bridge C18 analytical column(4.6\u00a0\u00d7 100\u00a0mm, 3.5\u00a0\u00b5m).

    "abstract": "Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a major challenge for clinicians and patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) is a key oncoprotein in the EGFR/AKT pathway that participates in tumorigenesis. We found that high SRPK1 expression was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing gefitinib treatment. Both in vitro and in vivo assays suggested that SRPK1 reduced the ability of gefitinib to induce apoptosis in sensitive NSCLC cells independently of its kinase activity. Moreover, SRPK1 facilitated binding between LEF1, \u03b2-catenin and the EGFR promoter region to increase EGFR expression and promote the accumulation and phosphorylation of membrane EGFR. Furthermore, we verified that the SRPK1 spacer domain bound to GSK3\u03b2 and enhanced its autophosphorylation at Ser9 to activate the Wnt pathway, thereby promoting the expression of Wnt target genes such as Bcl-X. The correlation between SRPK1 and EGFR expression was confirmed in patients. In brief, our research suggested that the SRPK1/GSK3\u03b2 axis promotes gefitinib resistance by activating the Wnt pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.",

This study mainly explored the factors affecting the prognosis of EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM), and whether osimertinib could improve the survival benefit in these patients compared with those not treated with osimertinib. We retrospectively analyzed patients who had been admitted with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and cytologically confirmed LM to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2013 and December 2019. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the primary outcome of interest. A total of 71 patients with LM were included in this analysis, with a median OS (mOS) of 10.7 months (95% CI [7.6, 13.8]). Among them, 39 patients were treated with osimertinib after LM while 32 patients were untreated. Patients treated with osimertinib had a mOS of 11.3 months (95%CI [0, 23.9]) compared with the untreated patients who had a mOS of 8.1 months (95%CI [2.9, 13.3]), with a significant difference between the groups (hazard ratio [HR]): 0.43, 95%CI:0.22-0.66, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009). Multivariate analysis revealed the use of osimertinib were correlated with superior OS with a HR of 0.43 (95%CI\u00a0[0.25, 0.75]), with a statistically significant difference (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Osimertinib can prolong the overall survival of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with LM and improve patient outcomes.",

APPLE is a randomized, non-comparative, phase II study in patients with common EGFR-mutant, treatment-naive non-small-cell lung cancer including three arms: arm A (osimertinib upfront until RECIST progression, PD), arm B [gefitinib until emergence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) EGFR T790M mutation by cobas EGFR test v2 or RECIST PD], and arm C (gefitinib until RECIST PD), and then switch to osimertinib in both arms. The primary endpoint is the progression-free survival (PFS) rate 'on osimertinib' at 18 months (PFSR-OSI-18) after randomization in arm B (H From November 2017 to February 2020, 52 and 51 patients were randomized into arms B and C, respectively. Most patients were females (70%) and had EGFR Del19 (65%); one-third had baseline brain metastases. In arm B, 17% of patients (8/47) switched to osimertinib based on the emergence of ctDNA T790M mutation before RECIST PD, with a median time to molecular PD of 266 days. The study met its primary endpoint of PFSR-OSI-18 of 67.2% (84% confidence interval 56.4% to 75.9%) in arm B versus 53.5% (84% confidence interval 42.3% to 63.5%) in arm C, with a median PFS of 22.0 months versus 20.2 months, respectively. The median OS was not reached in arm B versus 42.8 months in arm C. Median brain PFS in arms B and C was 24.4 and 21.4 months, respectively. The serial monitoring of ctDNA T790M status in advanced EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer during treatment with first-generation EGFR inhibitors was feasible, and a molecular progression before RECIST PD led to an earlier switch to osimertinib in 17% of patients with satisfactory PFS and OS outcomes.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant osimertinib in patients with EGFR-mutant resectable locally advanced NSCLC. This single-arm, phase 2b trial (ChiCTR1800016948) was conducted at six centers in mainland China. Patients with a measurable stage IIA-IIIB (T3-4\u00a0N2) lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR exon 19 and/or 21 mutations were enrolled. The patients were treated with osimertinib 80\u00a0mg orally once per day for six weeks, followed by surgical resection. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1. Between October 17, 2018, and June 08, 2021, 88 patients were screened for eligibility. Forty patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib therapy. The ORR was 71.1\u00a0% (27/38) (95\u00a0% confidence interval: 55.2-83.0) in 38 patients who completed the 6-week osimertinib treatment. Thirty-two patients underwent surgery, and 30 (93.8\u00a0%) underwent successful R0 resection. Thirty (75.0\u00a0%) of 40 patients had treatment-related adverse events during neoadjuvant treatment, and three (7.5\u00a0%) had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash (n\u00a0=\u00a020 [50\u00a0%]), diarrhea (n\u00a0=\u00a012 [30\u00a0%]), and oral ulceration (n\u00a0=\u00a012 [30\u00a0%]).

    "abstract": "Most epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are killed within a few days after osimertinib treatment; however, surviving cells remain detectable and are called drug-tolerant cells. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was reported to be involved in chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic resistance. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether PAI-1 is involved in osimertinib tolerance and whether it could be a therapeutic target for overcoming this tolerance. We showed that the PAI-1 mRNA expression levels and mesenchymal gene expression levels were significantly higher in drug-tolerant EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells than in control cells after 7 days of in vitro osimertinib treatment. Additionally, an RNA microarray analysis revealed upregulation of the integrin-induced EMT pathway in osimertinib-tolerant cells. Furthermore, we observed that PAI-1 inhibitors suppressed proliferation and the degree of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tolerant cells. Finally, in a subcutaneous tumor model, we showed that combining osimertinib with a PAI-1 inhibitor prevented the regrowth of tumors comprising EGFR-mutated cancer cells. The present study is the first to show PAI-1 to be involved in tolerance to osimertinib via EMT.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive clinical response rate of osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, as a frontline treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or as a salvage therapy for patients with T790M mutation, resistance to osimertinib is common in the clinic. The mechanisms underlying osimertinib resistance are heterogenous. While genetic mutations within EGFR or other cancer driver pathways mediated mechanisms are well-documented, the role of tumor cell and tumor immune microenvironment in mediating the response to osimertinib remains elusive. Here, using a syngeneic mouse model of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that tumor regression elicited by osimertinib requires activation of CD8+ T cells. However, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) accumulated in advanced tumors inhibit CD8+ T cell activation and diminish the response to osimertinib. These results are corroborated by analyses of clinical data. Notably, reprogramming TAMs with a systemic STING agonist MSA-2 reinvigorates antitumor immunity and leads to durable tumor regression in mice when combined with osimertinib. Our results reveal a new mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance and suggest a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "Clinical guidelines advise osimertinib as preferred first line treatment for advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with deletions in exon 19 (del19) or exon 21 L858R mutation. However, for first-line osimertinib the real world overall survival (OS) in mutation subgroups remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world OS of those patients treated with different generations of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), and to identify predictors of survival. Using real-world data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) we assessed patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with del19 or L858R mutation between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, primarily treated with then regularly available TKIs (including osimertinib). Between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020, 57,592 patients were included in the NCR. Within this cohort we identified 1109 patients, 654 (59%) with del19 and 455 (41%) with L858R mutations, respectively; 230 (21%) patients were diagnosed with baseline brain metastases (BM). Patients were treated with gefitinib (19%, 213/1109), erlotinib (42%, 470/1109), afatinib (15%, 161/1109) or osimertinib (24%, 265/1109). Median OS was superior for del19 versus L858R (28.4 months (95% CI 25.6-30.6) versus 17.7 months (95% CI 16.1-19.5), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001. In multivariable analysis, no difference in survival was observed between various TKIs in both groups. Only in the subgroup of patients with del19 and baseline BM, a benefit was observed for treatment with osimertinib. In this nationwide real-world cohort, survival of Dutch patients with advanced NSCLC and an EGFR del19 mutation was superior versus those harboring an L858R mutation. Osimertinib performed only better as first-line treatment in patients with del19 and BM. None.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer has become one of the leading causes of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common type among all lung cancer cases. NSCLC patients contained high levels of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, such as exon 19 deletion, L858R and T790M. Osimertinib, a third-generation of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has therapeutic efficacy on the EGFR-T790M mutation of NSCLC patients; however, treatment of osimertinib still can induce drug resistance in lung cancer patients. Therefore, investigation of the drug resistance mechanisms of osimertinib will provide novel strategies for lung cancer therapy. The H1975OR osimertinib-resistant cell line was established by prolonged exposure with osimertinib derived from the H1975 cells. The cell proliferation ability was evaluated by the cell viability and cell growth assays. The cell migration ability was determined by the Boyden chamber assays. The differential gene expression profile was analyzed by genome-wide RNA sequencing. The protein expression and location were analyzed by western blot and confocal microscopy. In this study, we established the osimertinib-resistant H1975 (T790M/L858R) cancer cells, named the H1975OR cell line. The cell growth ability was decreased in the H1975OR cells by comparison with the H1975 parental cells. Conversely, the cell migration ability was elevated in the H1975OR cells. We found the differential gene expression profile of cell proliferation and migration pathways between the H1975OR and H1975 parental cells. Interestingly, the protein levels of phospho-EGFR, PD-L1, E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin were decreased, but the survivin and N-cadherin proteins were increased in the H1975OR drug-resistant cells. Osimertinib induces the opposite effect of proliferation and migration in the drug resistance of EGFRT790M lung cancer cells. We suggest that differential gene and protein expressions in the cell proliferation and migration pathways may mediate the drug resistance of osimertinib in lung cancer cells. Understanding the molecular drugresistant mechanisms of proliferation and migration pathways of osimertinib may provide novel targets and strategies for the clinical treatment of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "For many patients with resected epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current standard of care (SoC) is adjuvant chemotherapy; however, disease recurrence remains high. Based on positive results from ADAURA (NCT02511106), adjuvant osimertinib was approved for treatment of resected stage IB\u2012IIIA EGFRm NSCLC. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant osimertinib in patients with resected EGFRm NSCLC. A five-health-state, state-transition model with time dependency was developed to estimate lifetime (38 years) costs and survival of resected EGFRm patients treated with adjuvant osimertinib or placebo (active surveillance), with/without prior adjuvant chemotherapy, using a Canadian Public Healthcare perspective. Transitions between health states were modeled using ADAURA and FLAURA (NCT02296125) data, Canadian life tables, and real-world data (CancerLinQ Discovery In the reference case, adjuvant osimertinib treatment led to a mean 3.20 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; (11.77 vs 8.57) per patient, versus active surveillance. The modeled median percentage of patients alive at 10 years was 62.5% versus 39.3%, respectively. Osimertinib was associated with mean added costs of Canadian dollars (C$)114,513 per patient and a cost/QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) of C$35,811 versus active surveillance. Model robustness was demonstrated by scenario analyses. In this cost-effectiveness assessment, adjuvant osimertinib was cost-effective compared with active surveillance for patients with completely resected stage IB\u2012IIIA EGFRm NSCLC after SoC.",

MET is involved in numerous cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and the formation of distant metastases. MET amplification and MET overexpression are quite common in many cancers, but MET exon 14 skipping alteration is most common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The role of MET signaling as a bypass pathway in the development of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in cancer patients with EGFR gene mutation was documented. Potential beneficiaries of savolitinib therapy are patients with NSCLC and initial diagnosis of MET ex 14 skipping mutation. Savolitinib therapy can be effective in NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutant MET with progression during first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI. Antitumor activity of savolitinib in combination with osimertinib is very promising as first-line therapy of patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC, initially with MET expression. The safety profile of savolitinib as monotherapy and in combination with osimertinib or gefitinib is so favorable in all available studies that this drug has become a very promising therapeutic option and is being intensively investigated in ongoing clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The transformation from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the mechanisms of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) resistance. Previous studies exhibited that the median transformation time was 17.8\u00a0months for NSCLC to SCLC. Here we introduced a case of lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) with EGFR19 exon deletion mutation in which the pathological transformation emerged only 1\u2009month after lung cancer surgery and receiving EGFR-TKI inhibitor. Eventually, the pathological examination confirmed the patient experienced a transformation from LADC to SCLC with EGFR, tumor\u00a0protein\u00a0p53\u00a0(TP53), RB\u00a0transcriptional\u00a0corepressor\u00a01\u00a0(RB1), and SRY-box\u00a0transcription\u00a0factor\u00a02\u00a0(SOX2)\u00a0mutation. Although the transformation of LADC with EGFR-mutant into SCLC after targeted therapy was frequent, the pathological results of most patients were only biopsy specimens, which cannot rule out the existence of mixed pathological components of the primary tumor. In this case, the patient's postoperative pathology was sufficient to exclude the probability of mixed tumor components, confirming that the patient's pathological change was indeed transformation from LADC to SCLC. In addition, primary drug resistance in such a short time after surgery and osimertinib-targeted therapy has not been reported before. We detected the molecular state of this patient before and after SCLC transformation through targeted gene capture and high-throughput sequencing, and also found for the first time that the mutations of EGFR, TP53, RB1, and SOX2 continue to exist before and after transformation, but the mutation abundance is different. In our paper, the occurrence of small-cell transformation is affected largely by these gene mutations.",

    "abstract": "The development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of lung cancer with EGFR mutations. Aumolertinib has been shown to be a safe agent in the registry study. However, successful rechallenge with aumolertinib following osimertinib-induced myocardial damage has not been reported. In this article, a case of neoadjuvant therapy for lung adenocarcinoma is retrospectively analyzed, and the relevant literature is reviewed. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma, and genetic testing revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation combined with Tumor Protein p53 (TP53) mutation. The mutation abundance is 33.5 and 14%, respectively. One month after osimertinib treatment, the patient developed myocardial damage, and abnormal indicators such as myocardial enzyme spectrum showed abnormalities and cardiac insufficiency, followed by pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary edema. Aumolertinib was subsequently used for treatment, following which the myocardial enzyme spectrum returned to normal, and the symptoms of bilateral interstitial edema disappeared. In addition to the disappearance of adverse reactions, the therapeutic effect was excellent; the lung lesions and mediastinal lymph nodes were significantly reduced, and the operation was successfully conducted. This is the first report of successful neoadjuvant treatment of EGFR exon 19 deletion combined with TP53 mutation in NSCLC using aumolertinib after osimertinib-induced myocardial damage. The results suggested that aumolertinib had fewer adverse reactions in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion combined with TP53 mutation, and aumolertinib may be a potential neoadjuvant therapy for stage IIIA lung cancer.",

Main features included female sex (56.3%), never or past smokers (76.0%), adenocarcinoma (95.4%), and tropism for bone (47.4%) and brain (32.0%) metastases. Mean programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportional score was 15.8% (range: 0%-95%) and mean tumor mutational burden was 7.06 (range: 0-18.8) mutations per megabase. Exon 20 was detected in the tissue (90.7%), plasma (8.7%), or both (0.6%), using mostly targeted next-generation sequencing (64.0%) or polymerase chain reaction (26.0%). Mutations were mainly insertions (59.3%), followed by duplications (28.1%), deletions-insertions (7.7%), and the T790M (4.5%). Insertions and duplications were located mainly in the near loop (codons 767-771, 83.1%) and the far loop (codons 771-775, 13%) and only in 3.9% within the C helix (codons 761-766). Main co-alterations included mutations in TP53 (61.8%) and MET amplifications (9.4%). Treatment on mutation identification included chemotherapy (CT) (33.8%), CT-immunotherapy (IO) (18.2%), osimertinib (22.1%), poziotinib (9.1%), mobocertinib (6.5%), mono-IO (3.9%), and amivantamab (1.3%). Disease control rates were 66.2% with CT plus or minus IO, 55.8% with osimertinib, 64.8% with poziotinib, and 76.9% with mobocertinib. Corresponding median overall survival was 19.7, 15.9, 9.2, and 22.4 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, type of treatment (new targeted agents versus CT \u00b1 IO) affected progression-free survival ( EXOTIC represents the largest academic real-world evidence data set on EGFR exon 20-mutant NSCLC in Europe. Indirectly compared, treatment with new exon 20-targeting agents is likely to confer survival benefit than CT plus or minus IO.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been found in more than 10% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in North America. The vast majority of these differences are L858R point mutations in Exon 21. Currently, monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of EGFR or small molecule/tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the stalwarts of NSCLC therapy. Resistance, however, gradually develops because of the T790 mutation towards first and second generation TKIs. The third generation TKI AZD9291 (Osimertinib) has a high affinity for both activating and the acquired resistant mutation (T790\u00a0M) in EGFR, with a low affinity towards wild-type EGFR. Recent research, however, suggests that the EGFR (C797S) mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain is a likely cause of resistance to AZD9291. Another significant transformation mechanism associated with this resistance is erbB2 amplification. Our laboratory has developed a small kinase inhibitor, ER121 (MW: \u223c500), that inhibits the erbB2/HER2 tyrosine kinases in addition to the EGFR C797S mutations. We have identified a TKI, ER121 targeting the mutant EGFR(T790\u00a0M). Using in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo models, examined the efficacy of ER121 on mutant EGFR cell lines. This has enabled us to establish that ER121 is well tolerated when administered orally and produces significant inhibitory activity against human cancers generated by mutant EGFR and amplified ErbB2.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and EGFR mutation is the most common genetic alteration among Asian patients with lung adenocarcinoma. While osimertinib has been shown to be effective in lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation, the majority of patients eventually develop acquired resistance to treatment. We explored the significance of the cyclin D1 expression in patients with EGFR mutation and the potential efficacy of adding abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, simultaneously with osimertinib in vitro. Immunohistochemical staining, using an anti-cyclin D1 antibody, of specimens from 83 patients with EGFR mutation (male, n\u2009=\u200927; pStage 0-I, n\u2009=\u200971) who were treated by surgical resection between 2017 and 2020, and the relationship between the cyclin D1 expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. Additionally, the combined effect of osimertinib and abemaciclib in lung cancer cell lines were analyzed using a growth inhibition test, and the signaling pathway underlying the combined effect was investigated. Cyclin D1 was negative in 18.1% of patients with EGFR mutation, and cyclin D1 negativity was associated with pStage\u2009\u2265\u2009II (p\u2009=\u20090.02), lymph node metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and lymphatic invasion (p\u2009=\u20090.01). The cyclin D1-negative group had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (p\u2009=\u20090.02), although this difference disappeared when limited to pN0 patients. In EGFR mutated cell lines, the combination of osimertinib and abemaciclib demonstrated synergistic effects, which were thought to be mediated by the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs may be a promising approach.",

    "abstract": "Current non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment consists of various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation, depending on the tumor stage. Individuals with stage II-IIIa NSCLC undergo surgery, followed by combination chemotherapy containing cisplatin, such as vinorelbine + cisplatin. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib, act by inhibiting any signaling pathway containing the EGFR mutation and inhibiting the growth of NSCLC. TKI is a treatment option in advanced NSCLC, resulting in more prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). This manuscript\u00a0aims to evaluate the influence of utilizing gefitinib - either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drug regimens upon NSCLC patient profile survival parameters. A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple scientific literature repositories. The review\u00a0was performed using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020. There were six randomized clinical trials (RCT) and five retrospective studies. The overall consensus based on the end outcome of each published journal on the effectiveness of gefitinib as a treatment option for NSCLC indicated that there was a notable difference in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) datasets. Gefitinib use correlated with increased timeframes for multiple patient survival parameters within articles shortlisted in this investigation. However, more comprehensive investigations are required to validate such correlations. Gefitinib did demonstrate the potential to provide beneficial effects and counteract NSCLC within such\u00a0patients.",

Patients with NSCLC treated with gefitinib or erlotinib for at least 1\u00a0week between January 2009 and October 2021 were enrolled and divided into four groups based on the presence/absence of TC and/or PPI in the therapeutic regimen: TC-/PPI-, TC\u2009+\u2009/PPI-, TC-/PPI\u2009+\u2009, TC\u2009+\u2009/PPI\u2009+\u2009.

The estimated median PFS and OS of 347 included patients with NSCLC were 8.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.66-9.48) months and 13.10 (95% CI: 11.03-15.17) months, respectively. Co-administration of EGFR-TKIs with PPIs decreased the PFS and OS, while that with TCs improved the PFS and OS. However, the concomitant use of EGFR-TKIs, TCs, and PPIs yielded survival rates similar to that of EGFR-TKI therapy alone. The administration of EGFR-TKIs with other drugs poses a challenge in managing patients with NSCLC. Therefore, reassessing the indications and necessity of TC or PPI therapy is essential for patients receiving erlotinib or gefitinib. The benefits and risks of possible discontinuation due to the clinical relevance of this interaction should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has brought significant benefits to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. However, most patients eventually develop acquired resistance after treatment. This study investigated the epigenetic effects of mucin 17 (MUC17) in acquired drug-resistant cells of EGFR-TKIs. We found that GR/OR (gefitinib/osimertinib-resistance) cells enhance genome-wide DNA hypermethylation, mainly in 5-UTR associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, in which GR/OR cells exerted a pro-oncogenic effect by downregulating mucin 17 (MUC17) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gefitinib/osimertinib acquired resistance mediated down-regulation of MUC17 by promoting DNMT1/UHRF1 complex-dependent promoter methylation, thereby activating NF-\u03baB activity. MUC17 increased the generation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and inhibit NF-\u03baB activity by promoting the expression of MZF1. ",

    "abstract": "The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein initiated the success story of targeted therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is currently indicated as first-line therapy in patients with NSCLC with sensitizing EGFR mutations, as second-line therapy in patients who present the resistance-associated mutation T790M after treatment with previous EGFR-TKIs, and as adjuvant therapy for patients with early stage resected NSCLC, harboring EGFR mutations. Despite durable responses in patients with advanced NSCLC, resistance to osimertinib, similar to other targeted therapies, inevitably develops. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance, including both EGFR-dependent and -independent molecular pathways, as well as their therapeutic potential, represents an unmet need in thoracic oncology. Interestingly, differential resistance mechanisms develop when osimertinib is administered in a first-line versus second-line setting, indicating the importance of selection pressure and clonal evolution of tumor cells. Standard therapeutic approaches after progression to osimertinib include other targeted therapies, when a targetable genetic alteration is detected, and cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without antiangiogenic and immunotherapeutic agents. Deciphering the when and how to use immunotherapeutic agents in EGFR-positive NSCLC is a current challenge in clinical lung cancer research. Emerging treatment options after progression to osimertinib involve combinations of different therapeutic approaches and novel EGFR-TKI inhibitors. Research should also be focused on the standardization of liquid biopsies in order to facilitate the monitoring of molecular alterations after progression to osimertinib.",

The survival following PD varies greatly between patients, and no effective treatment strategy has been established. Furthermore, at the moment, no easily accessible and precise biomarker exists that can predict the survival after PD. We analyzed blood samples drawn from non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations that were treated with osimertinib. The levels of 92 circulating proteins were analyzed from plasma samples using a proximity extension assay (PEA). The results were evaluated with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to reveal patterns of protein expression at progression while on osimertinib treatment. We found that the expression of 7 proteins were significantly altered at PD, compared to a sample taken at osimertinib response. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that most of the significant proteins were related to the immune system, specifically the adaptive immune response. Defining two groups of patients, based on the levels of circulating immune response proteins at PD, revealed significant differences in the overall survival (OS) after PD [hazard ratio (HR) =3.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-7.45; P=0.0046]. In this study, we discover novel circulating biomarkers that can predict the OS after PD on osimertinib.

We retrospectively collected the clinical data of advanced NSCLC patients with common EGFR mutation who were treated with 1/2-generation (1/2G) EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in first-line therapy in our center from January 2018 to December 2020. The detection rate of T790M by first and repeat rebiopsy was recorded, and we also analyzed the efficacy and safety of osimertinib for T790M-positive patients. Among 190 common EGFR-mutant patients who received 1/2G EGFR-TKIs with advanced NSCLC in the first-line treatment, 141 patients developed progressive disease. In total, 110 of 141 accepted the first rebiopsy, with a T790M prevalence of 50.9% (56/110). In total, 43 T790M-positive patients who received osimertinib were included in first rebiopsy group.

    "abstract": "Use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is the standard therapy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases. Several studies have shown that adding chemotherapy to EGFR-TKIs could improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC; however, the efficacy of these agents in patients with brain metastases remains unclear. To investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib plus chemotherapy (pemetrexed with platinum) compared with gefitinib alone in patients with untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases. This open-label prospective, multicenter, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted in 6 centers in China from January 13, 2016, to August 27, 2021. The median follow-up time was 21.1 months (IQR, 13.5-31.8 months). Patients with untreated confirmed brain metastases and EGFR-sensitive mutated NSCLC were enrolled. The eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive gefitinib plus chemotherapy or gefitinib alone. The primary end point was intracranial PFS; secondary end points included PFS, overall survival (OS), intracranial objective response rate, overall objective response rate, and safety. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. A total of 161 patients (87 [54.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 55 [9.8] years; range, 26-80 years) were enrolled and randomized to receive gefitinib (n\u2009=\u200981) or gefitinib plus chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u200980). The median intracranial PFS was 15.6 months (95% CI, 14.3-16.9 months) in the gefitinib plus chemotherapy group vs 9.1 months (95% CI, 8.0-10.2 months) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.53; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Similarly, the median PFS was significantly longer with gefitinib plus chemotherapy than gefitinib alone (16.3; 95% CI, 14.4-18.2 months vs 9.5; 95% CI, 8.3-10.8 months; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Gefitinib plus chemotherapy had a better intracranial objective response rate (85.0%; 95% CI, 77.0%-93.0% vs 63.0%; 95% CI, 52.2%-73.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.002) and overall objective response rate (80.0%; 95% CI, 71.0%-89.0% vs 64.2%; 95% CI, 53.5%-74.9%; P\u2009=\u2009.03) than gefitinib alone. At data cutoff, the median OS was also significantly longer in the gefitinib plus chemotherapy group vs the gefitinib group (35.0 vs 28.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common with gefitinib plus chemotherapy, most of which were manageable. In this randomized clinical trial, gefitinib plus chemotherapy significantly improved intracranial PFS, PFS, and OS compared with gefitinib alone in patients with untreated EGFR-mutant NSCLC brain metastases and could be an optional first-line treatment for these patients.

    "abstract": "The Graded Prognostic Assessment for lung cancer using molecular markers (Lung-molGPA) has not been validated for use with Japanese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastasis (BM) and the factors impacting survival need to be assessed. We retrospectively analyzed 294 NSCLC patients who were newly diagnosed with BM between 2013 and 2020 and had received radiotherapy for BM initially at the Hokkaido Cancer Center. We evaluated the effect on the prognosis of Lung-molGPA items, the expression of PD-L1 (classified as high, low, and no expression), and the treatment history. The main outcome was the survival measured from the day of the diagnosis of BM, and log-rank tests were performed to evaluate the results. The median overall survival (OS) times for adenocarcinoma by groups of GPA scores (0\u20121.0, 1.5\u20122.0, 2.5\u20123.0, and 3.5\u20124.0) were 5.5, 14.8, 28.3, and 39.0\u00a0months (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. The median survival times for non-adenocarcinoma by groups of GPA scores (0\u20121.0, 1.5\u20122.0, and 2.5\u20123.0) were 3.2, 11.0, and 16.0\u00a0months (p\u2009=\u20090.0011), respectively. In adenocarcinoma patients with gene mutations, osimertinib significantly improved the outcome (median OS: 34.2 and 17.6\u00a0months with and without osimertinib, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.0164)). There was no significant difference in the OS between patients who were initially treated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for BM and those who initially received radiotherapy (p\u2009=\u20090.5337). In patients tested for PD-L1 expression, the median survival times after the diagnosis of BM were 5.6, 22.5, and 9.3\u00a0months for the high-, low- and no-expression groups (p\u2009=\u20090.2198), respectively. Also, in patients with high PD-L1 expressions, those with ICI had survival (median OS, 8.6\u00a0months) than those without (median OS, 3.6\u00a0months). We confirmed that Lung-molGPA successfully classified Japanese NSCLC patients with BM by the prognosis. Osimertinib prolonged survival of EGFR-positive NSCLC patients with BM, and ICI was effective in patients with high PD-L1 expressions.",

    "abstract": "While the discovery of oncogenic driver mutations has personalized the metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment landscape with effective targeted therapies, implementation of new treatments in resectable NSCLC has been limited due to the long follow-up needed for overall survival (OS). Until recently, treatment for patients with early-stage resectable NSCLC has been limited to perioperative chemotherapy, which provides modest benefits. However, the regulatory acceptance of two surrogate endpoints for OS has allowed recent approval of both adjuvant osimertinib and atezolizumab, providing patients with new treatment options to improve outcomes. In phase 3 oncology trials, OS has historically been viewed as the gold-standard efficacy measure, but disease-free survival and event-free survival (EFS) are now validated surrogate endpoints for OS in clinical trials and should be considered when mature OS data is unavailable. Another potential surrogate endpoint in the adjuvant NSCLC setting is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD), although prospective validation is needed. For neoadjuvant targeted therapies, EFS, major pathologic response and ctDNA-based MRD are potential surrogate endpoints. To fully translate the success of the personalized treatment advances in the metastatic setting to earlier-stage disease, prospective validation studies of these potential surrogate endpoints that can accelerate the evaluation of drug efficacy are needed. A collaborative effort is also needed from all clinical and regulatory parties to collate surrogate endpoint data for large-scale validation. In this review we discuss the trends in surrogate endpoints used in oncology trials, with a focus on considerations for selecting appropriate primary endpoints in early-stage resectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC, an area of unmet need for novel treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is an established standard treatment option for chemotherapy-naive patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, of such patients who have received prior treatment with a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI, only approximately half are eligible for osimertinib therapy because its indication as second-line treatment and beyond is limited to metastatic NSCLC that is positive for the T790M resistance mutation of the EGFR gene. This study was initiated at the request of a dedicated network for patients with lung cancer in Japan. We conducted a phase II study to assess the efficacy of osimertinib in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in whom systemic disease (T790M-negative) progressed after treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs and platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was response rate (assessed by a central imaging reviewer). From August 2020 to February 2021, 55 patients from 15 institutions were enrolled in the study. The overall response for primary analysis was achieved in 16 patients (29.1\u00a0%; 95\u00a0% CI, 17.6-42.9), which exceeded the threshold response rate necessary for analysis. Stable disease was found in 16 patients (29.1\u00a0%), and progressive disease, in 18 (32.7\u00a0%). The median length of progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.07\u00a0months (95\u00a0% CI 2.10-4.30), and the rate of 12-month PFS was 17.3\u00a0%.

Considering that targeting PKM2 or PDK1 alone seems insufficient to remodel abnormal glucose metabolism to achieve significant antitumor activity, we proposed a \"two-step approach\" that regulates PKM2 and PDK1 synchronously. Firstly, we found that the combination of ML265 (PKM2 activator) and AZD7545 (PDK1 inhibitor) could synergistically inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in H1299\u00a0cells. Base on this, we designed a series of novel shikonin (SK) thioether derivatives as PKM2/PDK1 dual-target agents, among which the most potent compound E5 featuring a 2-methyl substitution on the benzene ring exerted significantly increased inhibitory activity toward EGFR mutant NSCLC cell H1975 (IC",

    "abstract": "Replacement of first-generation or second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with third-generation EGFR-TKIs remains the current standard of care for T790M mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Osimertinib is one of the first third-generation EGFR-TKIs to be approved and is also the most widely studied in clinical research. There has been widespread concern about the adverse effects of osimertinib such as cardiotoxicity and interstitial lung disease, but few articles have reported severe thrombocytopenia after osimertinib treatment. This article reports a 64-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer initially diagnosed with cT2aN1M1a, EGFR p.L858R, who developed disease progression and T790M after 32\u2009months of first-line treatment with gefitinib (250\u2009mg/day) before switching to second-line treatment with osimertinib (80\u2009mg/day). Severe thrombocytopenia and active bleeding occurred after treatment with osimertinib, which improved with recombinant human thrombopoietin and platelet transfusion. Treatment was replaced with aumolertinib (110\u2009mg/day). After platelet stabilization with aumolertinib treatment in combination with chest radiotherapy, this patient had progression-free survival for 9\u2009months and overall survival for over 45\u2009months. In conclusion, from our experience, aumolertinib has good efficacy and mild adverse effects, and is a good choice for non-small cell lung cancer patients with T790M, especially for patients at high risk of thrombocytopenia.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dramatically improve the clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR -sensitive mutations. Despite the remarkable efficacy of first-and second-generation EGFR TKIs, disease relapse is inevitable. EGFR T790M mutation is a primary contributor to the acquired resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs. Osimertinib, which is an irreversible third-generation EGFR TKI, was designed for EGFR -activating mutations as well as the EGFR T790M mutation in patients with advanced NSCLC and has demonstrated a convincing efficacy. However, acquired resistance to osimertinib after treatment inevitably occurs. The acquired resistance mechanisms to osimertinib are highly complicated and not fully understood, encompassing EGFR -dependent as well as EGFR -independent mechanisms. Treatment approaches for patients progressing from osimertinib have not been established. We present a case of a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring EGFR L858R, acquired T790M after treatment with first-line gefitinib. She then acquired a new EML4-ALK gene fusion after treatment with osimertinib. A combination targeted therapy of osimertinib plus alectinib was initiated, with a progression-free survival of 5\u2009months without any serious adverse reaction. After disease progression, EGFR C797S in cis was detected with a loss of the EML4-ALK fusion by targeted next-generation sequencing. Then therapy was changed to pemetrexed combined with bevacizumab plus camrelizumab, but no obvious effect was observed. The patient had achieved an overall survival of 31\u2009months. As far as we know, this was the first reported case that an EGFR -mutant NSCLC patient-acquired ALK fusion mediating resistance to osimertinib, and sequential EGFR C797S mutation mediating resistance to combined targeted therapy with osimertinib and alectinib. Our case shows that EML4-ALK fusion is a rare but critical resistance mechanism to osimertinib, and C797S mutation in cis may be an underlying mechanism of acquired resistance mutation in double TKIs therapy. Furthermore, molecular detection and rebiopsy play important roles in the selection of therapeutic strategies when the disease progresses.",

The primary end point was DFS by investigator assessment in stage II-IIIA disease analyzed by stratified log-rank test; following early reporting of statistical significance in DFS, no further formal statistical testing was planned. Secondary end points included DFS in stage IB-IIIA, overall survival, and safety. Patterns of recurrence and CNS DFS were prespecified exploratory end points. At data cutoff (April 11, 2022), in stage II-IIIA disease, median follow-up was 44.2 months (osimertinib) and 19.6 months (placebo); the DFS HR was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.30); 4-year DFS rate was 70% (osimertinib) and 29% (placebo). In the overall population, DFS HR was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34); 4-year DFS rate was 73% (osimertinib) and 38% (placebo). Fewer patients treated with osimertinib had local/regional and distant recurrence versus placebo. CNS DFS HR in stage II-IIIA was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42). The long-term safety profile of osimertinib was consistent with the primary analysis. These updated data demonstrate prolonged DFS benefit over placebo, reduced risk of local and distant recurrence, improved CNS DFS, and a consistent safety profile, supporting the efficacy of adjuvant osimertinib in resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are commonly used in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, patients will inevitably develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the long-term treatment process. In this paper, we report a case of small cell lung cancer transformation after EGFR-TKIs treatment in lung adenocarcinoma. We summarize the characteristics of this case and the treatment after transformation, and emphasized the repeat biopsy and dynamic monitoring its genetic mutation was necessary. A 75-years-old man with no smoking history was admitted to our hospital with repeated cough and expectoration for 1 month and chest enhancement computed tomography showed paracbronchial soft tissue mass in the lower lobe of the left lung, which was considered to be central lung cancer. The first pathological analysis of lung biopsy confirmed left lung adenocarcinoma and clinical stage was T3N3M1 IVA. In June 2021, the second bronchoscopic biopsy was performed, and pathology showed small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in the left lung. Gefitinib was given to patients when the first next generation sequence test showed EGFR L858 mutation. When the second next generation sequence test revealed EGFR T790M mutation, the patient received with osimertinib. The patient got 2 cycles chemotherapy of etoposide plus netaplatin when diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. Progression-free survival was only 8 months after gefitinib treatment. Moreover, the patient was insensitive to Oxitinib, and the disease progressed after 2 months of treatment with Oxitinib. Finally, he died of severe infection and hepatic failure after a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. Our case highlights that if a patient has rapid disease progression, increase of serum neuron-specific enolase, and TP53 and Rb1 inactivation during EGFR-TKIs treatment, we should be alert to the pathological type transformation to small cell lung cancer.",

    "title": "Bone metastatic carcinoma with EGFR amplification and mutation: A case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are highly prevalent in non-small cell lung cancer, while rare in other cancers. Primarily it's hardly present in bone metastases from cancer of unknown primary (BMCUP). Currently, no specific treatment options for bone metastases from unknown primary cancers exist. The right shoulder and back pain of a 72-years-old man had been persistent for 2 weeks and had developed worse on 1 particular day. The right upper arm was compromised, which also hindered the arm's ability to raise and flex, and nighttime sleep was impacted. After applying the analgesic patch externally, the symptoms did not improve. No coughing or sputum production, chest tightness, shortness of breath, acid reflux, belching, abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea, backache, hematuria, black or bloody feces, or other discomforts appeared over the course of the illness. The patient had a particular type of bone metastases from primary cancers with genetic test results indicating EGFR amplification and mutation. A third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors drug, oral Osimertinib 80\u2009mg once a day with bisphosphonates anti-bone destruction treatment was performed on schedule. Following treatment, the patient's tumor-related symptoms were significantly improved by controlling the disease for up to 11 months and providing great pain relief. EGFR-based genetic testing has emerged as a key measure for targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer. However, there are fewer relevant studies for other tumor types like BMCUP. Combined with literature reviews and our report, we provide evidence that targeting EGFR mutations according to the \"basket theory\" for the treatment of BMCUP is effective.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the first-line treatment for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aimed to determine the previously unclarified association of osimertinib plasma trough concentrations with efficacy, adverse events, and genetic polymorphisms in Japanese patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. In this prospective study, blood samples of 25 patients who received osimertinib were collected to measure plasma osimertinib concentrations and to genotypically characterize ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 polymorphisms. Plasma osimertinib concentrations were analyzed using validated multiple reaction monitoring mode-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Osimertinib concentration necessary to achieve optimal median progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. PFS and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and between-group differences were compared using the log-rank test. Plasma osimertinib concentrations between different patient groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Patients were divided into high and low concentration groups based on a plasma osimertinib cut-off concentration of 211 ng/ml. Median PFS was longer in the high trough concentration group than that in the low trough concentration group (46.3 vs. 16.8 months, p=0.029). Plasma osimertinib concentrations adjusted for dose and body weight did not differ between the patients with and without variant polymorphisms. Monitoring plasma trough concentrations during maintenance might improve osimertinib treatment efficacy in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.",

    "abstract": "Favorable clinical evidence suggests that the next trend in new treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be combination therapies. However, inevitable epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) resistance greatly limits the clinical efficacy of patients carrying EGFR-activating mutants. In this study, we found a patient with clinical osimertinib resistance who regained a positive response after osimertinib plus anlotinib treatment. Two osimertinib-resistant cell lines were constructed, and AXL conferred resistance to osimertinib in NSCLC cell lines. The combined effects of anlotinib and osimertinib restored sensitivity to osimertinib in two osimertinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines and in xenografts. Moreover, anlotinib inhibits the phosphorylation of AXL in both resistant cell lines. Mechanistically, we confirmed that MYC binds to the promoter of AXL to promote its transcription in NSCLC cells, and we demonstrated that anlotinib combined with osimertinib treatment enhances the anti-tumor effect by inactivating the c-MET/MYC/AXL axis to reverse osimertinib resistance in NSCLC. In conclusion, our results provide strong support that this combination therapy may be effective in enhancing the efficacy of treatments in patients with advanced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to perform a meta\u2011analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of gefitinib in combination with chemotherapy versus gefitinib alone in patients with advanced Non\u2011Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). We searched databases for clinical studies that reported the efficacy or safety of gefitinib plus chemotherapy in comparison with gefitinib alone. Raw data from included studies were extracted and pooled to calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) for Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR), the Hazard Ratio (HR) for Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS), and OR for complication \u2265 Grade 3. A total of 10 studies containing 1,528 patients with NSCLC were identified and included in the analysis. Gefitinib plus chemotherapy showed significantly better efficacy in improving ORR (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.54; 95% CI [Confidence Interval], 1.13\u20122.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), DCR (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.62; 95% CI 1.14\u20122.29; p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), PFS (HR=1.67; 95% CI 1.45\u20121.94; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.49; 95% CI 1.2\u20121.87; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as compared with gefitinib alone. Consistent results were observed in the sub-population with positive EGFR mutation. The combination of gefitinib with chemotherapy had a significantly higher risk of complication (\u2265 Grade 3) with an OR of 3.29 (95% CI 2.57\u20124.21; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

    "abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is a rapidly growing field with the goal of providing personalized care to every patient. Previously, we developed the Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for multiscale therapeutic discovery to screen optimal compounds for any indication/disease by performing analytics on their interactions using large protein libraries. We implemented a comprehensive precision medicine drug discovery pipeline within the CANDO platform to determine which drugs are most likely to be effective against mutant phenotypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the supposition that drugs with similar interaction profiles (or signatures) will have similar behavior and therefore show synergistic effects. CANDO predicted that osimertinib, an EGFR inhibitor, is most likely to synergize with four KRAS inhibitors.Validation studies with cellular toxicity assays confirmed that osimertinib in combination with ARS-1620, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, and BAY-293, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, showed a synergistic effect on decreasing cellular proliferation by acting on mutant KRAS. Gene expression studies revealed that MAPK expression is strongly correlated with decreased cellular proliferation following treatment with KRAS inhibitor BAY-293, but not treatment with ARS-1620 or osimertinib. These results indicate that our precision medicine pipeline may be used to identify compounds capable of synergizing with inhibitors of KRAS G12C, and to assess their likelihood of becoming drugs by understanding their behavior at the proteomic/interactomic scales.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance has become a challenge in effective longterm molecular targeted therapy. Longterm non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatments with the first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) shorten the effective duration of the third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib, via genetic or epigenetic mechanisms in addition to the gatekeeper mutation T790M. This study reproduced this persistence in\u00a0vitro using gefitinib-resistant NSCLC PC-9\u00a0cells (GR cells) and revealed that pharmacological nuclear localization inhibition of \u03b2-catenin suppressed the osimertinib resistance. Osimertinib effectively reduced GR cell survival but left significantly more resistant colonies than parental PC-9\u00a0cells. The nuclear fraction of \u03b2-catenin was enriched in GR cells during acquisition of osimertinib resistance. A chemical nuclear localization inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin, IMU1003, dramatically decreased the emergence of osimertinib-resistant colonies. Forced nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin reduced IMU1003 efficacy. Thus, suppression of the nuclear \u03b2-catenin function may overcome the transgenerational EGFR-TKI-resistance.",

ASTRIS is the largest real-world study that evaluated the outcomes with osimertinib treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the EGFR T790M mutation, who had received previous treatment for their cancer. There were 3014 patients included in this study. The main aim of this study was to measure the time at which half of the patients were still alive after starting osimertinib treatment, this was 22.8 months. The study also measured the time at which half of the patients had experienced worsening (progression) of their cancer (11.1 months) and the time when half of the patients had stopped receiving osimertinib treatment (13.5 months). None of the patients experienced any unexpected side effects of the treatment. These data are consistent with those observed in comparable clinical trials with osimertinib, supporting the use of osimertinib treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC and the EGFR T790M mutation after their initial cancer treatment has stopped working.",

    "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) metastases are common in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated with poor prognosis and high disease burden. Effective options are needed to treat CNS metastases, and delay or prevent their formation. For epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm) advanced NSCLC and brain metastases, upfront EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are recommended by the joint European Association of Neuro-Oncology-European Society for Medical Oncology and experts. While early-generation EGFR-TKIs have limited CNS efficacy, the third-generation, irreversible, EGFR-TKI osimertinib has potent efficacy in NSCLC CNS metastases. This review discusses the CNS data of osimertinib in the context of therapeutic strategies and future prospects based on expert review of published literature and relevant clinical, real-world, and ongoing studies in this setting. Osimertinib penetrates the blood-brain barrier and achieves greater exposure in the brain compared with other EGFR-TKIs. Osimertinib has demonstrated CNS efficacy, including in leptomeningeal metastases, in EGFRm advanced disease. In EGFRm stage IB-IIIA NSCLC, adjuvant osimertinib reduced CNS disease recurrence versus placebo. The burden and poor prognosis of CNS metastases necessitate more therapeutic options for their management and reduced risk of recurrence in patients with EGFRm NSCLC. Clinical studies are ongoing in advanced disease to investigate osimertinib combinations with chemotherapy/radiation therapy and optimal treatment post-CNS progression with osimertinib. Further prospective research evaluating treatments using CNS-specific endpoints and evaluating CNS resistance is needed to improve outcomes for patients with CNS metastases.",

This phase 1b-2 study (NCT03381274) evaluated the anti-CD73 antibody oleclumab plus the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Patients had tissue T790M-negative NSCLC with TKI-sensitive EGFR mutations after progression on a first- or second-generation EGFR TKI and were osimertinib naive. They received osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily plus oleclumab 1500 mg (dose level 1 [DL1]) or 3000 mg (DL2) intravenously every 2 weeks. Primary end points included safety and objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. By July 9, 2021, five patients received DL1 and 21 received DL2.

No dose-limiting toxicities, serious TRAEs, or deaths occurred. Four patients were T790M positive on retrospective circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing; three had objective partial responses. In patients who were T790M negative in tumor and ctDNA, objective response rate was 25.0% at DL1 and 11.8% at DL2 (all partial responses); response durations at DL2 were 14.8 and 16.6 months. In patients receiving DL2, excluding those who were T790M positive by ctDNA, median progression-free survival was 7.4 months, and median overall survival was 24.8 months.

    "abstract": "The landmark ADAURA study recently demonstrated a significant disease-free survival benefit of adjuvant osimertinib in patients with resected EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. However, data on prevalence rates and stage distribution of EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in Western populations are limited since upfront EGFR testing in early stage lung adenocarcinoma is not common practice. Here, we present a unique, real-world, unselected cohort of lung adenocarcinoma to aid in providing a rationale for routine testing of early stage lung cancers for EGFR mutations in the West-European population. We performed routine unbiased testing of all cases, regardless of TNM stage, with targeted next-generation sequencing on 486 lung adenocarcinoma cases between 01- January 2014 and 01 February 2020. Clinical and pathological data, including co-mutations and morphology, were collected. EGFR-mutated cases were compared to KRAS-mutated cases to investigate EGFR-specific characteristics. In total, 53 of 486 lung adenocarcinomas (11%) harboured an EGFR mutation. In early stages (stage 0-IIIA), the prevalence was 13%, versus 9% in stage IIIB-IV. Nine out of 130 (7%) stage IB-IIIA patients fit the ADAURA criteria. Early stage cases harboured more L858R mutations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), fewer exon 20 insertions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), fewer TP53 co-mutations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and were more frequently never smokers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) compared to late stage cases with EGFR mutations. The KRAS-mutated cases were distributed more evenly across TNM stages compared to the EGFR-mutated cases. As (neo-)adjuvant targeted therapy regimes enter the field of lung cancer treatment, molecular analysis of early stage non-small cell lung cancer becomes relevant. Testing for EGFR mutations in early stage lung adenocarcinoma holds a substantial yield in our population, as our number needed to test ratio for adjuvant osimertinib was 14.4. The observed differences between early\u00a0and late stage disease warrant\u00a0further analysis to work towards better prognostic stratification and more personalised treatment.",

    "abstract": "As of today, only two antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies plus epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combinations are FDA and EMA-approved and are recommended by American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network for the first-line treatment of EGFR+ advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients: erlotinib plus bevacizumab and erlotinib plus ramucirumab. However, all treated patients eventually become unresponsive to such drugs, due to several different acquired resistance mechanisms, mainly represented by T790M substitutions and MET amplifications. While osimertinib treatment in T790M+ patients still represents the only approved treatment, MET-TKIs will likely change this status quo in the near future. In fact, existing clinical data strongly support a role for MET-TKI-based combinations in EGFR+ MET-amplified patients, possibly revolutionizing our current treatment algorithm. Chemotherapy plus immunotherapy plus antiangiogenic therapy combinations could also represent another useful addition.",

It is a secondary EGFR mutation after first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). All EGFR T854A mutations were co-occurred with EGFR L858R mutation in cis. There is still no clear evidence to guide the therapeutic options for patients with both EGFR T790M and T854A mutations. A 60-year-old Chinese woman with no smoking history presented with a maximum diameter of 32.9\u2009mm mass located in the right lower lung lobe. The patient was diagnosed with stage IVA lung adenocarcinoma with an exceptionally uncommon EGFR T854A mutation in exon 21 was detected concomitantly with EGFR T790M in blood by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The patient was initially treated with first-line afatinib. After disease progression, osimertinib was administered. Our patient exhibited a partial response (PR) to osimertinib with progression-free survival of nearly 8 months. Our study indicates that patients with NSCLC who are positive for uncommon EGFR T854A and T790M mutations might benefit from treatment with osimertinib.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but responses are not durable as tumors develop resistance. DS-1205c is a novel, specific, orally bioavailable, small-molecule AXL receptor TKI. In preclinical studies, DS-1205c restored TKI antitumor activity in a TKI acquired-resistance EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor xenograft model. This first-in-human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03599518) primarily evaluated the safety and tolerability of combination therapy with DS-1205c and gefitinib in Japanese patients with metastatic or unresectable EGFR-mutant NSCLC and tumor progression during treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a020) received DS-1205c monotherapy (200-1200\u2009mg twice daily [BID]) in a 7-day safety monitoring period before combination DS-1205c/gefitinib (250\u2009mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. The observed common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were increased aspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (30%), rash maculo-papular (30%), and diarrhea (25%). No serious TEAEs were reported. Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of DS-1205a (free form of DS-1205c) were unaffected by concomitant administration of gefitinib. No patient achieved a complete or partial response and 5 patients (25%) had stable disease. DS-1205c was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels, but the safety profile of \u2264800\u2009mg BID was more favorable than 1200\u2009mg BID. The recommended dose for dose-expansion cohorts of DS-1205c in combination therapy with gefitinib was 800\u2009mg BID.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKIs) was one of the main drugs in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies had demonstrated that PDZ and LIM Domain 5 (PDLIM5) played an important role in EGFR TKIs resistance. However, there was no feasible method to eliminate EGFR TKIs resistance by suppressing this gene. Here, we formulated a novel mesoporous silica-loaded PDLIM5 siRNA (Small interfering RNA) nanoplatforms. The results have shown that PDLIM5 siRNA could be effectively bound to the nanoplatforms and had good biocompatibility. Further exploration suggested that the nano-platform combined with ultrasonic irradiation could be very effective for siRNA delivery and ultrasound imaging. Moreover, Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) changes occurred in PC-9 Gefitinib resistance (PC-9/GR) cells during the development of drug resistance. When PDLIM5 siRNA entered PC-9/GR cells, the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to gefitinib could be restored through the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/EMT pathway. Therefore, PDLIM5 may be an important reason for the resistance of NSCLC cells to gefitinib, and this nanoplatform may become a novel treatment for EGFR TKIs resistance in NSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence indicates that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a limited efficacy in patients with lung cancer harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, there is a lack of data on the efficacy of ICIs after osimertinib treatment, and the predictors of ICI efficacy are unclear. We retrospectively assessed consecutive patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who received ICI-based therapy after osimertinib treatment at 10 institutions in Japan, between March 2016 and March 2021. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the expression of p53 and AXL. The deletions of exon 19 and the exon 21 L858R point mutation in EGFR were defined as common mutations; other mutations were defined as uncommon mutations. A total of 36 patients with advanced or recurrent EGFR-mutant NSCLC were analyzed. In multivariate analysis, p53 expression in tumors was an independent predictor of PFS after ICI-based therapy (p\u2009=\u20090.002). In patients with common EGFR mutations, high AXL expression was a predictor of shorter PFS and overall survival after ICI-based therapy (log-rank test; p\u2009=\u20090.04 and p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). The levels of p53 in pretreatment tumors may be a predictor of ICI-based therapy outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC after osimertinib treatment. High levels of AXL in tumors may also be a predictor of ICI-based therapy outcomes, specifically for patients with common EGFR mutations. Further prospective large-scale investigations on the predictors of ICI efficacy following osimertinib treatment are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) capable of overcoming non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR T790M mutation. Although the addition of bevacizumab to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs confers a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in treatment-naive EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, osimertinib plus bevacizumab combination failed to show prolongation in the phase 2 study WJOG8715L. Data of such combination in Chinese patients are still lacking. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to osimertinib as second-line therapy in real-world data, and to evaluate the role of anti-angiogenesis plus osimertinib combination therapeutic strategies in pretreated Chinese NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR T790M mutation. A total of 42 advanced NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR T790M mutation after prior EGFR-TKIs treatment were collected between January 2020 to August 2021, with 16 cases treated with osimertinib plus bevacizumab and 26 cases treated with osimertinib. The treatment effect of patients were analyzed. The objective response rate (ORR) in combination group and osimertinib group were 43.8% and 50.0% respectively (P=0.694). No statistically significant difference in median PFS (14.0 mon vs 13.0 mon, P=0.797) and overall survival (OS) (29.0 mon vs 26.0 mon, P=0.544) between the combination group and osimertinib group were observed. Prior history of bevacizumab was identified as an independent predictor of PFS (P=0.045) and OS (P=0.023). Our study demonstrated that adding bevacizumab to osimertinib could not show advantages in PFS and OS in pretreated NSCLC patients harboring EGFR T790M-mutation. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u6027EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u665a\u671f\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\u7684\u7597\u6548\u5206\u6790\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u662f\u5bf9\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff08epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR\uff09T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u9776\u5411\u836f\u7269\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ee3EGFR\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\uff08EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR-TKIs\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u53ef\u5ef6\u957f\u65e0\u8fdb\u5c55\u751f\u5b58\u671f\uff08progression-free survival, PFS\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u7684\u540e\u7ebf\u7597\u6548\u5728II\u671f\u7814\u7a76WJOG8715L\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u80af\u5b9a\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u8be5\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u4e8c\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u6297\u8840\u7ba1\u6cbb\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728EGFR T790M\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u8010\u836f\u7a81\u53d8NSCLC\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u6536\u96c62020\u5e741\u6708-2021\u5e748\u6708\u6536\u6cbb\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u4ee3EGFR-TKIs\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u4f34EGFR T790M\u7a81\u53d8NSCLC\u60a3\u8005\u517142\u4f8b\u300216\u4f8b\u63a5\u53d7\u4e8c\u7ebf\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u53e626\u4f8b\u63a5\u53d7\u4e8c\u7ebf\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\u5206\u6790\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u8054\u5408\u7ec4\u548c\u5355\u836f\u7ec4\u5ba2\u89c2\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff08objective response rate, ORR\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff0843.8% vs 50.0%, P=0.694\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u7ec4\u4e2d\u4f4dPFS\uff0814.0\u4e2a\u6708 vs 13.0\u4e2a\u6708\uff0cP=0.797\uff09\u548c\u603b\u751f\u5b58\u671f\uff08overall survival, OS\uff09\uff0829.0\u4e2a\u6708 vs 26.0\u4e2a\u6708\uff0cP=0.544\uff09\u5747\u672a\u89c1\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u3002Cox\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u524d\u7ebf\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u6cbb\u7597\u662f\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u540e\u7ebf\u5355\u836f\u6216\u8054\u5408\u6cbb\u7597PFS\uff08P=0.045\uff09\u53caOS\uff08P=0.023\uff09\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\u8054\u5408\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u4e8c\u7ebf\u6cbb\u7597\u76f8\u6bd4\u9776\u5411\u5355\u836f\u6cbb\u7597\u672a\u89c1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7597\u6548\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\uff1b\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u5965\u5e0c\u66ff\u5c3c\uff1b\u8d1d\u4f10\u73e0\u5355\u6297\u3011.",

Afatinib had a wider soluble pH range, with possible fewer interactions with antacids. However, clinical data were limited. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the negative impact of PPIs on afatinib. This retrospective cohort study included patients who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 2014 to 2019 using the Chang Gung Research Database. We identified patients who were treated with first-line afatinib and analyzed the association between the PPI and afatinib treatment outcomes. A total of 1418 patients were treated with first-line afatinib and followed up for 6 years. First-line afatinib was administered to 918 eligible patients, and 330 had afatinib with PPIs. The combination use of PPIs and afatinib significantly decreased the overall survival (OS) compared with that of patients using afatinib only (median OS: 33.2 and 25.1 months,  The concurrent use of PPIs was associated with lower OS in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer under the first-line afatinib treatment but not associated with TTF.",

Thus, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with osimertinib and afatinib for patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib. This open-label phase I study was a feasibility study of the combination of afatinib and osimertinib for patients with advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC who had progressive disease after receiving osimertinib. The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We enrolled patients who received afatinib at three different dose levels (level 1, 20\u2009mg; level 2, 30\u2009mg; level 3, 40\u2009mg) combined with osimertinib at a standard dose of 80\u2009mg once per day. Thirteen patients were enrolled in this study. The MTD was defined as 30\u2009mg afatinib when combined with daily oral administration of osimertinib (80\u2009mg). The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (76.9%), anemia (76.9%), and rash (69.2%). Considering the toxicity profiles during all treatment periods, the recommended oral dose of afatinib was determined as 20\u2009mg daily, with an osimertinib dose of 80\u2009mg. For all evaluable patients (n\u2009=\u200912), the response rate was 7.7% and the disease-control rate was 46.2%. Combination therapy with osimertinib and afatinib was tolerable; however, the synergistic effect of afatinib with osimertinib may be limited in osimertinib-resistant patients.

    "abstract": "Brain metastasis is common in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at initial presentation. A previous study showed that brain radiotherapy (RT) before first-generation (first-G) EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is associated with longer overall survival than TKI therapy alone. However, there is no data regarding the role of additional brain RT before afatinib therapy. Between October 2014 and June 2019, EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with brain metastases who started first-G EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) or afatinib as first-line therapy were retrospectively analyzed. This study compared overall survival and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who received EGFR-TKIs alone and EGFR-TKIs with brain RT and either a first-G EGFR-TKI or afatinib, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 29.6 months (range, 1.5 to 116.9 months). In the first-G EGFR-TKI group (n=155), 94 patients (60.6%) received the first-G EGFR-TKI alone and 61 patients (39.4%) received brain RT prior to their first-G EGFR-TKI. In the afatinib group (n=204), 126 patients (61.8%) received afatinib alone and 78 patients (38.2%) received brain RT prior to afatinib. There was no difference in overall survival rates between the groups with RT (35.6 months: 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.9 to 43.3) and without RT (31.4 months: 95% CI, 23.9 to 38.9) in the afatinib group (p=0.58), but there was a significant difference in overall survival in the first-G EGFR-TKI group in a manner favoring additional brain RT (41.1 months: 95% CI, 30.5 to 51.7 vs. 25.8 months: 95% CI, 20.1 to 31.5; p=0.02). Meanwhile, median intracranial PFS was not different between patients who received EGFR-TKI therapy alone vs. EGFR-TKI therapy with brain RT in both the first-G EGFR-TKI (p=0.39) and afatinib (p=0.24) groups. Afatinib therapy alone showed comparable survival outcomes to those of afatinib with brain RT. The current study suggests that brain RT could be an optional, not mandatory, treatment modality when afatinib therapy is considered in patients with EGFR</>-mutant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations are initially responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, therapeutic resistance eventually emerges, often via secondary EGFR mutations or EGFR-independent mechanisms such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Treatment options after EGFR-TKI resistance are limited as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors typically display minimal benefit. Given that IL6 is associated with worse outcomes in patients with NSCLC, we investigate whether IL6 in part contributes to this immunosuppressed phenotype. We utilized a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of EGFR-mutant NSCLC to investigate the effects of IL6 on the tumor microenvironment and the combined efficacy of IL6 inhibition and anti-PD-1 therapy. Corresponding in vitro studies used EGFR-mutant human cell lines and clinical specimens. We identified that EGFR-mutant tumors which have oncogene-independent acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs were more mesenchymal and had markedly enhanced IL6 secretion. In EGFR-mutant GEMMs, IL6 depletion enhanced activation of infiltrating natural killer (NK)- and T-cell subpopulations and decreased immunosuppressive regulatory T and Th17 cell populations. Inhibition of IL6 increased NK- and T cell-mediated killing of human osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumor cells in cell culture. IL6 blockade sensitized EGFR-mutant GEMM tumors to PD-1 inhibitors through an increase in tumor-infiltrating IFN\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells. These data indicate that IL6 is upregulated in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumors with acquired EGFR-TKI resistance and suppressed T- and NK-cell function. IL6 blockade enhanced antitumor immunity and efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy warranting future clinical combinatorial investigations.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its prognosis remains dismal. Development of drug resistance is a major obstacle against success of targeted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy. This study aimed to assess the prognostic role of annexin A2 (ANXA2) expression, within both tumor cells and stroma, as well as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in NSCLC and to investigate their potential role in induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resistance to gefitinib. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate tumoral and stromal ANXA2 expression and \u03b1-SMA-stained CAFs in 110 advanced NSCLC patients. Furthermore, STAT3 and E-cadherin mRNA expression was studied by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Both tumoral and stromal ANXA2 as well as CAFs were significantly related to clinical stage IV and malignant pleural effusion, while tumoral ANXA2 was significantly related to poor tumor differentiation. EGFR mutation and high tumoral ANXA2 were independent factors for poor overall survival, whereas high stromal and tumoral ANXA2 and high CAFs were independent predictors for poor progression-free survival. Moreover, high ANXA2 and CAFs were significantly associated with high STAT3 and low E-cadherin mRNA expression. Focusing on EGFR mutated cases, gefitinib resistance was significantly associated with high tumoral and stromal ANXA2, high CAFs, high STAT3 and low E-cadherin. CAFs and ANXA2 could be considered as poor prognostic parameters in advanced NSCLC and are potential factors for gefitinib therapy resistance through EMT induction.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance severely limits the clinical therapeutic value of molecularly targeted drugs. Growth factors gain a tremendous amount of focus due to the ability to promote drug resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, whether tumor cells themselves can mediate drug resistance by secreting growth factors needs further clarification. Here, we first screened growth factors to identify autocrine epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-\u03b1) that caused primary resistance to the ALK inhibitor TAE684 in H3122 cells and the c-MET-specific inhibitor SGX-523 in EBC-1 cells. Next, we discovered increased autocrine production of EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in established acquired resistant H3122/TR and EBC-1/SR cells. Importantly, overexpression of EGF and TGF-\u03b1 in two NSCLC cell lines produced resistance to TAE684 and SGX-523. Clinically, NSCLC patients with high expression of EGF and TGF-\u03b1 developed primary resistance to crizotinib. Mechanistically, autocrine EGF and TGF-\u03b1 activated EGFR signaling pathways to survive targeted c-Met and ALK inhibition. Furthermore, combined treatment with gefitinib circumvented EGF- and TGF-\u03b1-mediated primary and acquired resistance to TAE684/SGX-523. Taken together, these results suggested increased autocrine EGF and TGF-\u03b1 conferred primary and acquired resistance to ALK/c-Met kinase inhibitors in NSCLC.",

This study investigated radiological responses to gefitinib regarding bone metastasis in patients. We treated 260 patients with NSCLC and symptomatic bone metastasis. Thirty-seven patients harboring EGFR mutation were treated with gefitinib for more than 30\u00a0days and followed up for more than 3\u00a0months (GEF group). We performed a retrospective observational study by selecting 36 cases without EGFR-TKI treatment, at least 3\u00a0months of follow-up, and at least two radiological evaluations as the control group. We assessed the best overall radiological response, interval from treatment initiation to appearance of a radiological response, and the local response maintenance rate. The best effect in the GEF group was 98% partial response or better, which was significantly higher than the 57% observed in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The GEF and control groups maintained 83% and 42% local response maintenance rates at one year, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the GEF with radiotherapy group, the local response maintenance rate was maintained at 92% at 1\u00a0year, while in the GEF without RT group, there was a decrease in the local response maintenance rate from 270\u00a0days. Gefitinib treatment for bone metastases in patients harboring EGFR mutation resulted in a beneficial osteosclerotic change in most patients.

    "abstract": "Molecular testing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is commonly limited by inadequate tumor sample. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) genotyping as a complementary test is specific but only moderately sensitive. Genotyping of cfDNA in pleural and pericardial effusion (PE-cfDNA) can further optimize molecular diagnostic yield and reduce the need for repeated biopsies. To prospectively validate droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) for detection of sensitizing EGFR variants and acquired Thr790Met variant (T790M) from PE-cfDNA in patients with NSCLC. This prospective diagnostic validation study was conducted between September 6, 2016, and January 21, 2021 at 2 major Hong Kong cancer centers. Patients with advanced NSCLC with both wild-type and variant EGFR status and exudative PE who underwent thoracocentesis or pericardiocentesis were randomly enrolled. Patients were either EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive (cohort 1) or EGFR-TKI treated but osimertinib naive (cohort 2). Enrolled patients underwent pleural- or pericardial-fluid and blood sampling for ddPCR EGFR testing. EGFR status results with ddPCR testing of PE-cfDNA and blood were compared with EGFR status in matched tumor biopsy or PE cell block samples. Specificity, sensitivity, and concordance of PE-cfDNA for detection of sensitizing EGFR variants and acquired T790M variation. Among 171 patients (54% female) enrolled, there were 104 in cohort 1 and 67 in cohort 2. In cohort 1, 37% (38/102) were EGFR-variant positive; PE-cfDNA showed 97% sensitivity (95% CI, 92%-100%), 97% specificity (95% CI, 93%-100%), and 97% concordance (\u0138\u2009=\u20090.94, P\u2009<\u2009.001) for the detection of sensitizing EGFR variants. It was more sensitive than plasma in detecting sensitizing EGFR variants (97% vs 74%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). In cohort 2, 38% (15 of 40) were positive for the EGFR T790M variant; PE-cfDNA showed 87% sensitivity (95% CI, 69%-100%), 60% specificity (95% CI, 41%-79%), and 70% concordance (\u0138\u2009=\u20090.42, P\u2009=\u2009.004) for acquired T790M. The EGFR T790M variant was detected in 51% of PE-cfDNA vs 25% of PE cell block samples. In this diagnostic study, EGFR variants could be accurately detected from PE-cfDNA in patients with NSCLC. More EGFR T790M was detected in PE-cfDNA than in guideline-recommended PE cell block preparations. These results suggest that PE-cfDNA can complement plasma and tumor genotyping for detecting EGFR variants in patients with advanced NSCLC.",

While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the drug screen.",

    "abstract": "Histological transformation from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of mechanisms of the acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, SCLC transformation and tumor heterogeneity have never been reported in sequential targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Here, we described a patient with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, who received erlotinib and underwent the resistance with EGFR T790M (-). The patient then received chemotherapy plus immunotherapy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, encountered progression with pathological transformation from NSCLC to SCLC that was overcome by chemotherapy of etoposide plus carboplatin (EC) with the main lesion significantly shrinking while metastatic nodules increasing. The pathology of the metastatic nodule showed NSCLC with EGFR T790M (+). Based on the tumor heterogeneity, EC chemotherapy combined with osimertinib was used, and patients responded well. The patient experienced four lung biopsies in all, which helped to provide the patient with precise treatment. This case suggested that SCLC transformation and tumor heterogeneity should be paid attention to when disease progression occurred in advanced NSCLC whether receiving targeted therapy or immunotherapy.",

In this prospective, single arm, phase II study, patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with EGFR-TKI (icotinib 125 mg tid or gefitinib 250 mg qd) for one month followed by SBRT (40-60 Gy/5-8 F/5-10 d) to the primary tumor with concurrent EGFR-TKI until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS and the patterns of failure. Overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs) were secondary endpoints. Overall, 41 advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations received treatment with 24.42 months of median follow-up time. On average, SBRT was initiated 1.49 months after EGFR-TKI administration. Tumors were found to have an average shrinkage rate of 42.50%. Median PFS was 15.23 months (95% CI 13.10-17.36), while median OS was 27.57 months (95% CI 23.05-32.09). Thirty-three patients were found to have disease progression, of which new site failure (NF) (22 patients, 66.66%) was the most common pattern, followed by original site failure (OF) (7 patients, 21.21%) and simultaneous OF/NF (ONF) (4 patients, 12.12%). There were no Aes equal to or greater than grade 3, with the most frequent AE being radiation pneumonitis.

Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, has been established as the preferred EGFR inhibitor for newly diagnosed patients which urged the need to develop treatment options for patients progressing on first-line osimertinib. However, acquired resistance invariably emerges and numerous efforts have been attempted to delay or overcome acquired resistance. In this article, we thoroughly reviewed the current understanding of osimertinib resistance mechanisms and explored the established and emerging treatment options. Newer treatment strategies targeting EGFR-dependent or -independent resistance mechanisms, novel approaches using bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates will be discussed. Moreover, what to do with brain only progression, and how to incorporate immunotherapy in EGFR-mutant lung cancer will be discussed.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis represents a less invasive alternative to tissue biopsy for analyzing mutation status, but its clinical value may vary across disease stages. To explore clinical correlates of ctDNA and tissue/plasma-based EGFR mutation (EGFRm) status across all NSCLC stages. Ninety patients were analyzed, representing three cohorts: newly-diagnosed early-stage, advanced-stage, and recurrent NSCLC. Relationships among clinical/surgical parameters, ctDNA, EGFRm status, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Plasma/tissue EGFRm concordance was lower in early-stage (58.6%) than in advanced-stage patients (87.5%). In early-stage patients, ctDNA levels were variable and not significantly associated with clinical/surgical parameters. In advanced-stage patients, time to EGFR-TKI treatment failure (TTF), but not overall survival (OS), was significantly longer in EGFRm-positive vs. EGFRm-negative patients. In patients with recurrent disease, 40% of plasma samples were EGFRT790M-positive at recurrence. In T790M-positive patients, we noted slight trends toward longer OS with vs. without osimertinib treatment and longer OS and TTF with second-line vs. later-line osimertinib. Our results affirm the use of ctDNA testing in advanced-stage and recurrent NSCLC. Further studies on osimertinib as early-line therapy, clinical correlates and the utility of plasma-based testing in early-stage NSCLC are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKIs), such as osimertinib, show great success in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutated tumors. However, almost all patients develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs owing to secondary EGFR mutations. Although genetic and irreversible resistance mechanisms have been proposed, little is known about non-genetic and reversible resistance mechanisms. From this perspective, a recent study revealed that acute drug exposure generates drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs) as a form of non-genetic resistance. However, the biological characteristics of DTPs remain unclear. As lipid peroxidation is related to cancer progression and drug resistance, we focused on ferroptosis, namely programmed cell death induced by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, in DTPs. We examined the biological characteristics of ferroptosis in osimertinib-mediated DTPs derived from PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Unlike PC9 cells, established PC9 DTPs were highly sensitive to the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. Accordingly, PC9 DTPs had increased levels of lipid reactive oxygen species and ferrous ion accumulation. Moreover, RSL3-mediated cell death in PC9 DTPs was completely rescued by treatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine. These results suggest that PC9 DTPs showed increased intracellular ferrous ion accumulation and were susceptible to ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer chemotherapy indications for patients with poor performance status and advanced lung cancer are limited. Molecular targeted drugs, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can be used in patients with poor performance status owing to their high efficacy and safety. The third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib has demonstrated effectiveness in the initial treatment of advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in patients with good performance status; however, no evidence exists of the drug's effectiveness in patients with poor performance status in a prospective study. We designed a study that aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line osimertinib treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring sensitive EGFR mutations and with poor performance status. The OPEN/TORG2040 study is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial for patients with unresectable, advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer with a poor performance status (\u2265 2). Eligible patients will receive osimertinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate of the first-line osimertinib treatment. Considering a threshold value of 45%, expected value of 70% for objective response rate, one-sided significance level of 5%, statistical power of 80%, and ineligible patients, the sample size was set to 30. The secondary endpoints are disease control rate, performance status improvement rate, and safety and patient-reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer 13. Time to treatment failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival will also be assessed. Our study can determine the clinical benefits of osimertinib treatment in patients with poor performance status, since the clinical outcomes of patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer with poor performance status treated with this drug as a first-line treatment have not been sufficiently evaluated.

To better understand the nature of lazertinib inhibition, we determined crystal structures of lazertinib in complex with both WT and mutant EGFR and compared its binding mode to that of structurally related EGFR TKIs. We observe that lazertinib binds EGFR with a distinctive pyrazole moiety enabling hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions facilitated through hydrophilic amine and hydrophobic phenyl groups, respectively. Biochemical assays and cell studies confirm that lazertinib effectively targets EGFR(L858R/T790M) and to a lesser extent HER2. The molecular basis for lazertinib inhibition of EGFR reported here highlights previously unexplored binding interactions leading to improved medicinal chemistry properties compared to clinically approved osimertinib (AZD9291) and offers novel strategies for structure-guided design of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Through pre-clinical pharmacological, biological, and molecular studies, we characterize the functional link between drug resistance and central nervous system (CNS) relapse in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-\u00a0(EGFR-) mutant non-small cell lung cancer, which can progress in the brain when treated with the CNS-penetrant EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Despite widespread osimertinib distribution in vivo, the brain microvascular tumor microenvironment (TME) is associated with the persistence of malignant cell sub-populations, which are poised to proliferate in the brain as osimertinib-resistant lesions over time. Cellular and molecular features of this poised state are regulated through a Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and Serum Responsive Factor (SRF) gene expression program. RhoA potentiates the outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells on osimertinib treatment, preferentially in response to extracellular laminin and in the brain. Thus, we identify pre-existing and adaptive features of metastatic and drug-resistant cancer cells, which are enhanced by RhoA/SRF signaling and the brain TME during the evolution of osimertinib-resistant disease.",

However, acquired resistance significantly limits its therapeutic efficacy. CircSETD3 has been reported to promote gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells, however, its underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. The expression of circSETD3 were detected in NSCLC patients who received gefitinib as first-line treatment, including 20 gefitinib-sensitive patients and 20 acquired gefitinib-resistant patients. Cell viability were examined by CCK8 assay. The mRNA and protein levels were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Using RNA pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry to identified proteins that interact with circSETD3. The interaction between circSETD3 and fragile X-related protein-1 (FXR1) were further validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and pull-down analysis. Fuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays was used for the identification of sub-location of circSETD3 and FXR1 in cells. The effect of circSETD3 overexpression and knockdown on NSCLC tumor growth to gefitinib sensitivity was detected using the mouse xenograft model. CircSETD3 was significantly upregulated in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, and decreased the gefitinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, circSETD3 facilitated FXR1 binding to its downstream mRNA target, epithelial cell-transforming sequence 2 (ECT2), promoting ECT2 mRNA decay, which further inhibited cellular apoptosis. CircSETD3/FXR1/ECT2 axis plays a critical role in the acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC. Our results highlight the potential of circSETD3 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC patients with acquired gefitinib resistance.",

Osimertinib is a potent irreversible third-generation EGFR-TKI targeting EGFR mutations but has little effect on wild-type EGFR. In view of its remarkable efficacy and manageable safety, osimertinib was recommended as the standard first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. However, as the other EGFR-TKIs, osimertinib will inevitably develop acquired resistance, which limits its efficacy on the treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. The etiology of triggering osimertinib resistance is complex including EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent pathways, and different therapeutic strategies for the NSCLC patients with osimertinib resistance have been developed. Herein, we comprehensively summarized the resistance mechanisms of osimertinib and discuss in detail the potential therapeutic strategies for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients suffering osimertinib resistance for the sake of the improvement of survival and further achievement of precise medicine.",

Meta-analysis indicated that ORR (odds ratio [OR] = 3.40, 95% CI 1.64\u223c7.01, p = 0.0009), DCR (OR = 4.36, 95% CI 3.09\u223c6.15, p < 0.00001), PFS (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.27\u223c0.47, p < 0.00001), and OS (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.46\u223c0.72, p < 0.00001) of the experimental group were prominently better than the control group. Adverse events of grades 3 and 4 mainly incorporated decreased nausea, rash, stomatitis, and vomiting, which were dramatically relieved compared with the control group. Osimertinib is currently an appreciably effective and well-tolerated therapeutic avenue for EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Although osimertinib is a standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, the incidence rate of pneumonitis associated with osimertinib is high. However, there are few reports about the safety and efficacy of osimertinib rechallenge after the development of pneumonitis. We conducted a retrospective multicentre cohort study of consecutive patients who developed pneumonitis associated with osimertinib as a first-line and received osimertinib rechallenge. The primary outcome was the incidence rate of any grade pneumonitis after osimertinib rechallenge. The secondary outcome was treatment efficacy in patients after osimertinib rechallenge. In total, 33 patients who received osimertinib rechallenge were included. Of them, 26 patients had grade 1, 6 patients had grade 2, and 1 patient had grade 3 initial pneumonitis. The median follow-up period after the osimertinib rechallenge was 16.9 months (interquartile range, 11.1-21.3 months). After the start of osimertinib rechallenge, five patients (15%) experienced mild relapsed pneumonitis. Three of the five patients had similar imaging patterns for initial and relapsed pneumonitis. No significant differences in characteristics were observed between patients with and without relapsed pneumonitis. The median progression-free survival after osimertinib rechallenge was not achieved (95% confidence interval: 10.3 months - not reached). Osimertinib rechallenge was feasible and effective for patients who developed initial pneumonitis associated with first-line osimertinib therapy. Osimertinib might be considered a treatment option even after the development of mild initial pneumonitis.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has identified ANGPTL4 as a key player in the control of the body's lipid and glucose metabolism and a contributor to the onset of numerous cardiovascular conditions. Recently, it has been shown that ANGPTL4 also plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression. Nowadays, the number of EGFR-TKI resistant patients is increasing, and it is important to investigate the role of ANGPTL4 in regulating gefitinib resistance in PC9/GR non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of ANGPTL4 in A549, PC9, H1975, BEAS-2B and PC9/GR cells was verified by Western blot and qRT-PCR assays, and the effect of gefitinib on the proliferative ability of each cell was probed by CCK-8 assay. By using shRNA to inhibit ANGPTL4 expression in cells, the effect of ANGPTL4 on cell migratory ability was examined and the effect of ANGPTL4 on cellular gefitinib sensitivity was confirmed using the CCK-8 assay and the edu proliferation test. Mouse transplantation tumors were constructed, and the effect of ANGPTL4 on cellular gefitinib sensitivity was investigated in vivo by flow cytometry, Tunel staining assay, immunohistochemical staining, and ROS fluorescence staining assay. ANGPTL4 expression in homoRNA overexpression cells was constructed, and the changes in the expression levels of ASC\\NLRP3\\Caspase 8 pathway and focal and apoptotic proteins were investigated in vitro, in vivo, afterknockdown and overexpression of ANGPTL4 expression by Westen blot assay. ANGPTL4 was highly expressed in PC9/GR cells. Interfering with ANGPTL4 expression resulted in decreased proliferation and migration ability, decreased resistance to gefitinib, and increased scorching and apoptosis in PC9/GR cells. Interfering with ANGPTL4 expression in PC9/GR cells was shown to promote sensitivity to gefitinib and to mediate the NLRP3/ASC/Caspase 8 pathway to induce cell scorching and apoptosis. ANGPTL4 promotes gefitinib resistance in PC9/GR cells by regulating the NLRP3/ASC/Caspase 8 pathway to inhibit scorch death. ANGPTL4 may be an effective new target for inhibiting EGFR-TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Studies have revealed that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations has a high incidence of brain metastases (BMs). However, the association between EGFR mutations and BMs remains unknown. This review summarizes detailed information about the incidence of BMs, clinical and imaging characteristics of BMs, brain surveillance strategies, influence of treatments on BMs, prognosis after BMs, and differences in EGFR mutations between paired primary tumors and BMs in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The prognostic results demonstrate that patients with mutated EGFR have a higher incidence of BMs, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) (afatinib and osimertinib) delay the development of BMs, and patients with mutated EGFR with synchronous or early BMs have better overall survival after BMs than those with wild-type EGFR. The EGFR mutation status of BM sites is not always in accordance with the primary tumors, which indicates that there is heterogeneity in EGFR gene status between paired primary tumors and BMs. However, the EGFR gene status of the primary site can largely represent that of BM sites. Among patients developing synchronous BMs, patients with mutated EGFR are less likely to have central nervous system (CNS) symptoms than patients with wild-type EGFR. However, the possibility of neuro-symptoms is high in patients with metachronous BMs. Patients with mutated EGFR tend to have multiple BMs as compared to patients with wild-type EGFR. Regarding very early-stage NSCLC patients without neuro-symptoms, regular neuroimaging follow-up is not recommended. Among advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation, liberal brain imaging follow-up in the first several years showed more advantages in terms of cost.",

The third-generation TKIs, like osimertinib and furmonertinib, can reach higher concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than other TKIs, and exhibit a beneficial effect in NSCLC patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) harboring sensitive EGFR mutation. Here, we report that two-stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with LM harboring an EGFR L858R mutation benefit from the third-generation EGFR-TKIs rechallenge after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and anti-angiogenic agent combination therapy. Complete response (CR) to partial response (PR) of central nervous system (CNS) response was achieved immediately after the administration of furmonertinib and osimertinib. We conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and IHC to elucidate the evolution of driver mutations and the immune microenvironment. In conclusion, these two cases might provide a therapeutic strategy for further clinical practice. More research was needed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms and improve current treatment strategies in EGFR-mutated patients with LM.",

    "abstract": "Despite the dynamic treatment landscape for EGFR mutant-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (EGFRm+ mNSCLC), most of the earlier studies have focused on US or Western populations. The objective of this study was to explore real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of South Korean patients with EGFRm+ mNSCLC. Retrospective chart review of adult patients with EGFRm+ mNSCLC who received systemic treatment between January-2019 and June-2019. A total of 162 patients were included from 21 hospitals, with a median follow-up of 15.6 months. Median age was 65.0 years, 22% had central nervous system metastasis, and 57% and 38% had exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R, respectively. Among 144 patients (89%) who received first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, afatinib was most the common (44%), followed by gefitinib (28%) and erlotinib (13%). First-line chemotherapy was more common when an EGFR-mutation was detected after versus before first-line treatment initiation (31% vs 5%). Discontinuation of first-line treatment was mostly due to disease-progression (81%) and toxicity (7%). Among 58 (78%) patients who received second-line treatment, osimertinib was the most common (40%). Most (60%) patients reported \u22651 Grade \u22653 adverse event during first-line treatment. Following initiation of first-line treatment, physician visits and chest X-rays were the most frequent healthcare utilisation events. Rates of emergency-room visits and hospitalization were 12% and 16%, respectively, with a mean length-of-stay of 10.4 days. At 12 months, overall survival rate was 95%, and numerically worse for patients with exon 21 versus 19 mutations. Characteristics and clinical outcomes of Korean patients with EGFRm+ mNSCLC in real-world practice were comparable to those observed in clinical trials. As osimertinib was not reimbursed for first-line treatment before study completion, further investigation is warranted to explore evolving treatment practice.",

    "abstract": "After the identification of specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations as one of the most common oncogenic driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), several EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with different clinical efficacies have been approved by various health authorities in the last two decades in targeting NSCLC harboring specific EGFR-activating mutations. However, most patients whose tumor initially responded to the first-generation EGFR-TKI developed acquired resistance. In this study, we developed a novel combination strategy, \"antiADAM17 antibody A9(B8)\u2009+\u2009EGFR-TKIs\", to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. The addition of A9(B8) was shown to restore the effectiveness of erlotinib and overcome acquired resistance. We found that when A9(B8) antibody was treated with erlotinib or gefitinib, the combination treatment synergistically increased apoptosis in an NSCLC cell line and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, the addition of A9(B8) could only reduce the survival of the erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line and inhibit the growth of erlotinib-resistant tumors in vivo but not gefitinib-resistant cells. Furthermore, we revealed that A9(B8) overcame erlotinib resistance through the FOXO3a/FOXM1 axis and arrested the cell cycle at the G",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that consolidation durvalumab confers limited benefits for patients with stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Induction or maintenance EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may optimize definitive treatment, but there are limited data supporting an induction TKI strategy. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of induction EGFR TKIs administered before concurrent CRT in a retrospective series of patients with unresectable locally advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis was performed on a patient subset using CAPP-seq and correlated with outcomes. Of six patients, three received erlotinib and three osimertinib as induction therapy before CRT. Induction TKIs were administered for a median of 2.5 months. The objective response rate after induction TKI was 83%. One patient had a complete response to induction erlotinib and continued erlotinib for 4 years until local progression, which was treated with CRT. Two patients completed maintenance erlotinib after CRT, and another received consolidation durvalumab. After a median follow-up of 20.5 months, only one patient developed disease recurrence, with rising ctDNA coinciding with recurrence. ctDNA remained undetectable in patients without recurrence, or low-level in a patient receiving maintenance erlotinib. Adverse events were mild and expected, and none developed pneumonitis. Induction EGFR TKI before CRT may achieve high disease control rates with promising signs of durability in patients with locally advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC. ctDNA analysis after CRT can correlate well with clinical outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of induction EGFR TKIs in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Tumor response T cells, which have specific T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, determine their ability to interact with the mutation-derived neoantigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. Little is known about the genetic alterations related to specific TCR clones in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. In this study, tumor tissues were collected from 101 patients with stage II/III resectable NSCLC with an EGFR mutation (57 patients were treated with gefitinib and 44 were treated with chemotherapy) in the ADJUVANT-CTONG1104 trial for high-throughput TCR\u03b2 V region and exome sequencing. Ten clonal TCRs were associated with EGFR exon 19 deletion (del), EGFR exon 21 mutation (L858R), RB1 alteration, TP53 exon 4/5 missense mutation, TP53 nonsense mutation, or copy number gains in NKX2-1 and CDK4. Among the TCRs, there was frequent use of V\u03b220-1J\u03b22-3 specifically for EGFR exon 19 del or V\u03b29J\u03b22-1 specifically for EGFR exon 21 mutation (L858R), and these were significantly associated with favorable overall survival (OS) for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR exon 19 del or exon 21 L858R, particularly in the adjuvant gefitinib setting. Moreover, in comparison with the chemotherapy-preferable (CP) group, higher frequencies of V\u03b220-1J\u03b22-3 and V\u03b29J\u03b22-1 were found in the highly TKI-preferable (HTP) or TKI-preferable (TP) groups. Altogether, we identified ten TCR rearrangements specific for genetic alterations in NSCLC. Importantly, high abundance V\u03b220-1J\u03b22-3 or V\u03b29J\u03b22-1 may be an immune biomarker for guiding adjuvant gefitinib decisions for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR exon 19 del or EGFR exon 21 L858R.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs and prognostic factors for patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations, which account for 10% of EGFR mutations. A total of 230 treatment-naive patients with NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs between 2011 and 2018 at four hospitals (belonging to four institutions, Linkou, Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Chiayi, of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital) in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed. Their clinicopathological characteristics, adverse events (AEs), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify potential prognostic factors for PFS. Overall, patients who received afatinib (n\u00a0=\u00a062) had better PFS (median: 6.4 vs. 5.9\u2009months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and OS (median: 13.4 vs. 13.0\u2009months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) than those who received gefitinib/erlotinib (n\u00a0=\u00a0124), although no significant differences were observed for ORR (46.8% vs. 35.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.137) or DCR (59.7% vs. 58.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.916). Patients who received afatinib showed significantly higher ORR (58.3% vs. 31.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027) but not DCR compared with gefitinib/erlotinib for major uncommon mutations. Afatinib trended toward better PFS and OS for major uncommon mutations and compound mutations. No EGFR-TKIs were effective for most NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertions. Performance status, metastasis of the liver and pleura, and dose reduction were independent prognostic factors for PFS. Afatinib demonstrated better survival outcomes than gefitinib/erlotinib for NSCLC patients harboring major EGFR uncommon mutations and compound mutations. Performance status and metastatic sites may be useful for predicting PFS for major uncommon mutations and compound mutations.",

    "title": "[STE029 Overcomes EGFR-TKI Resistance in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma].",
    "abstract": "Acquired and primary resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is still the bottleneck of clinical treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). STE029 is a novel anticancer drug which consists of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor and novel cancer cell membrane targeting molecular. This study aimed to investigate the reversal mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance by STE029 in lung adenocarcinoma. CCK8 test was used to test the cell viability and survival rate of EGFR mutated PC9 cell (Gefitinib sensitive), PC9/BB4 cell (acquired Gefitinib resistant), and EGFR wild type A549 cell after treatment of STE029, Gefitinib or combination of both. EdU test was applied to detect changes in cell cycle and Hoechst 33258 was applied to detect apoptosis rate in overcoming the EGFR-TKI resistance. The activity of EGFR/PI3K/Akt, cell cycle and apoptosis signal pathways were examined. In vivo, nude mice were exposed to STE029, Gefitinib and STE029+Gefitinib for 5 wk. And the the tumor volume was measured and tumor weight was obtained on the last day. (1) PC9 cells was highly sensitive to Gefitinib, while PC9/BB4 and A549 cell showed significant resistance to Gefitinib treatment; (2) STE029+Gefitinib treatment could significantly decrease the 50% inhibitory concentrarion (IC\u2085\u2080) of Gefitinib in PC9, PC9/BB4 and A549 cells (P<0.05, respectively); (3) In PC9 and PC9/BB4 cells, STE029+Gefitinib can block cell cycle and inhibit cell proliferation (P<0.001), while there was no significant difference in apoptosis rate among three drug intervention groups (P>0.05); However, apoptosis rate was increased in STE029+Gefitinib group in A549 cell (P<0.01), while no significance detected in cell proliferation (P>0.05). (4) In PC9 and PC9/BB4 cells, the combination of STE029 and Gefitinib could downregulate p-EGFR, p-Akt, p-Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D1 (P<0.001), and upregulate the expression of GSK-3\u03b2 (P<0.001), and the expression of cleaved caspase-8, caspase-8 cleaved caspase-9, caspase-9 showed no difference among groups (P>0.05). In A549 cells, the combination of STE029 and Gefitinib could downregulate p-Akt (P<0.001) and upregulate cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved caspase-9 (P<0.001); (5)In vivo, the combination of STE029 and Gefitinib effectively inhibited tumor development and progression compared to STE029 alone or Gefitinib alone, with significant difference (P<0.05) in PC9 and PC9/BB4 xenografted tumor. STE029 could sensitize Gefitinib by inhibiting EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway, blocking the tumor cell cycle and proliferation and inducing apoptosis through caspase-8 and caspase-9 dependent pathway. STE029 deserves further investigations in overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer. \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1aSTE029\u9006\u8f6c\u80ba\u817a\u764cEGFR-TKI\u8010\u836f\u2029\u53ca\u5176\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u8868\u76ae\u751f\u957f\u56e0\u5b50\u53d7\u4f53\u916a\u6c28\u9178\u6fc0\u9176\u6291\u5236\u5242\uff08epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, EGFR-TKI\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u8010\u836f\u548c\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u8010\u836f\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6cbb\u7597\u665a\u671f\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC\uff09\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002STE029\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7f9f\u7532\u57fa\u620a\u4e8c\u9178\u5355\u9170\u8f85\u9176A\u8fd8\u539f\u9176\uff083-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, HMGCR\uff09\u6291\u5236\u5242\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u9776\u5411\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6297\u80bf\u7624\u836f\u7269\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8STE029\u9006\u8f6c\u80ba\u817a\u764cEGFR-TKI\u7684\u8010\u836f\u673a\u5236\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 STE029\u3001\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u5355\u836f\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406PC9\u3001PC9/BB4\u3001A549\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5404\u7ec6\u80de\u682a\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\uff0c\u9274\u5b9aEGFR/PI3K/Akt\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\u53ca\u51cb\u4ea1\u76f8\u5173\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdfSTE029\u3001\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u5355\u836f\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u5bf9PC9\u3001PC9/BB4\u88f8\u9f20\u76ae\u4e0b\u79fb\u690d\u7624\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u2460PC9\u7ec6\u80de\u4e3aEGFR\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u7ec6\u80de\uff0cPC9/BB4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e3aEGFR\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u8010\u836f\u7ec6\u80de\uff0cA549\u7ec6\u80de\u4e3a\u975eEGFR\u7a81\u53d8\u7684\u8010\u836f\u7ec6\u80de\uff1b\u2461STE029\u8054\u5408\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8ePC9\u3001PC9/BB4\u3001A549\u7ec6\u80de\u540e\uff0c\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u7684\u534a\u6570\u6291\u5236\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0850% inhibitory concentration, IC\u2085\u2080\uff09\u503c\u8f83\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u5747\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u2462STE029\u8054\u5408\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u53ef\u6291\u5236PC9\u3001PC9/BB4\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u589e\u6b96\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfcA549\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u589e\u52a0\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff1b\u2463\u5728PC9\u3001PC9/BB4\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u7ec4\u8f83\u5355\u836f\u7ec4p-EGFR\u3001p-Akt\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u8c03\uff08P<0.000,1\uff09\uff0cGSK-3\u03b2\u8868\u8fbe\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e0b\u6e38p-Cyclin D1\u53caCyclin D1\u8868\u8fbe\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0ccleaved caspase-8\u3001caspase-8\u3001cleaved caspase-9\u3001caspase-9\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5728\u5404\u7ed9\u836f\u7ec4\u95f4\u672a\u89c1\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff08P>0.05\uff09\uff1b\u5728A549\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u7ec4p-Akt\u8868\u8fbe\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u8c03\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0ccleaved caspase-8\u3001cleaved caspase-9\u8868\u8fbe\u5747\u5347\u9ad8\uff08P<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u800cGSK-3\u03b2\u3001p-Cyclin D1\u3001Cyclin D1\u3001caspase-8\u3001caspase-9\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u8fbe\u5728\u5404\u7ed9\u836f\u7ec4\u95f4\u5219\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff08P>0.05\uff09\uff1b\u2464\u88f8\u9f20\u4f53\u5185\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u7ec4PC9\u76ae\u4e0b\u79fb\u690d\u7624\u7684\u751f\u957f\u660e\u663e\u53d7\u5230\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.01\uff09\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u7528\u836f\u7ec4PC9/BB4\u76ae\u4e0b\u79fb\u690d\u7624\u7684\u751f\u957f\u901f\u7387\u4ea6\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba STE029\u53ef\u5728\u4f53\u5185\u5916\u660e\u663e\u589e\u52a0\u975eEGFR-T790M\u7a81\u53d8\u8010\u836f\u7684\u4eba\u80ba\u817a\u764c\u7ec6\u80de\u5bf9\u5409\u975e\u66ff\u5c3c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eSTE029\u901a\u8fc7EGFR/PI3K/Akt\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8def\u8c03\u8282GSK-3\u03b2\u3001Cyclin D1\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u963b\u6ede\u7ec6\u80de\u589e\u6b96\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\u6709\u5173\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1aSTE029\uff1bEGFR-TKI\uff1b\u8010\u836f\uff1b\u7ec6\u80de\u51cb\u4ea1\uff1b\u7ec6\u80de\u5468\u671f\uff1b\u80ba\u817a\u764c\u3011.",

This study aims to explore a rational combination strategy for enhancing the OSI efficacy. In this study, OSI induced higher CD47 expression, an important anti-phagocytic immune checkpoint, via the NF-\u03baB pathway in EGFR-mutant NSCLC HCC827 and NCI-H1975 cells. The combination treatment of OSI and the anti-CD47 antibody exhibited dramatically increasing phagocytosis in HCC827 and NCI-H1975 cells, which highly relied on the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis effect. Consistently, the enhanced phagocytosis index from combination treatment was reversed in CD47 knockout HCC827 cells. Meanwhile, combining the anti-CD47 antibody significantly augmented the anticancer effect of OSI in HCC827 xenograft mice model. Notably, OSI induced the surface exposure of \"eat me\" signal calreticulin and reduced the expression of immune-inhibitory receptor PD-L1 in cancer cells, which might contribute to the increased phagocytosis on cancer cells pretreated with OSI. In summary, these findings suggest the multidimensional regulation by OSI and encourage the further exploration of combining anti-CD47 antibody with OSI as a new strategy to enhance the anticancer efficacy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC with CD47 activation induced by OSI.",

Among 536 enrolled patients, 362 (67.5%) were EGFR mutation-positive, including 182 in the ER arm and 180 in the GE arm. Median survival time (MST) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. OS and PFS were determined for patients with EGFR mutation. MSTs of ER (n\u2009=\u2009182) and GE arms (n\u2009=\u2009180) were 31.97 and 27.98\u00a0months, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.3573, hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.116).

    "abstract": "Different EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring sensitizing mutations in the EGFR gene. Apart from acquired secondary mutations, multiple resistance mechanisms have been reported, such as the overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a multi-functional enzyme essential for the de novo lipogenesis, or the increase of cancer stem cells, a small subpopulation within the tumor responsible for relapse, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. Hence, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the novel FASN inhibitor AZ12756122, both alone and in combination with gefitinib and osimertinib, in EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) lung adenocarcinoma cell models sensitive and resistant to EGFR-TKIs. The molecular effect of AZ12756122 (alone and in combination with EGFR-TKI) on FASN, EGFR/STAT3, Akt/mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways was analyzed using RT-qPCR and Western blot. FASN expression was also evaluated in samples from patients with EGFRm NSCLC through immunohistochemistry. Our findings revealed that AZ12756122 caused cytotoxic effects inducing apoptosis, downregulated FASN expression and activity, decreased the activation of EGFR and Akt/mTOR pathway, and reduced cancer stem-like cells. Furthermore, the combination of AZ12756122 and osimertinib sensitized cells to EGFR-TKI, showing a synergistic effect that resulted in a reduction in the activation of EGFR, Akt/mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways. Our study also showed that FASN+\u00a0EGFRm NSCLC patients exhibited a longer mPFS in patients who responded to EGFR-TKI treatment. In conclusion, FASN inhibition should be further studied for the treatment, alone or in combination with EGFR-TKIs, for EGFRm NSCLC patients.",

    "title": "Notch pathway regulates osimertinib drug-tolerant persistence in EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has shown marked antitumor activity in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, these effects are transient and most patients develop resistance. Reversible drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells are defined as a small subpopulation of cells with markedly reduced sensitivity and non-genetic acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Notch is a transmembrane receptor that plays an important role in tumorigenesis. We previously reported that there is significant crosstalk between the Notch and EGFR pathways in NSCLC. Moreover, the Notch pathway is associated with resistance to previous-generation EGFR-TKIs. However, the role of Notch in osimertinib resistance is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated whether Notch is involved in osimertinib resistance. We show that NOTCH1 and Notch target genes are upregulated in osimertinib DTP cells, and that the addition of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI), a Notch inhibitor, impairs drug-tolerant persistence in vitro and in vivo. Compared with osimertinib, combined GSI and osimertinib suppress phospho-ERK partly by enhancing DUSP1 expression. Furthermore, Notch1 and HES1 were upregulated after EGFR-TKI treatment in half of human EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumor tissues. These results suggest that the combination of GSI and osimertinib may be a potential therapy for EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Although the clinical application of osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has been a new step forward in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an increasing number of patients with progression on osimertinib represents a great challenge clinically. The patterns of resistance mechanisms and subsequent treatment strategies after first-line osimertinib resistance are not well established. Between January 1, 2016 and October 31, 2020, a consecutive of 56 EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with osimertinib as first-line therapy at Daping Hospital (Chongqing, China) were retrospective screened. The samples of pre-osimertinib and osimertinib-resistance were all detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 23.0 software. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test between groups. Among 47 patients with osimertinib effectiveness analysis, the median progression free survival (mPFS) was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.2-24.9 months), and median overall survival (mOS) was 35.5 months (95% CI: 23.9 months -NA). A total of 21 patients underwent repeated NGS tests upon osimertinib resistance. MET amplification was the most common resistance mechanism (6/21, 28.6%), followed by C797S mutation (5/21, 23.8%). A total of 15 patients received subsequent treatments, with mPFS of 7.3 months (95% CI 5.0 months -NA). Among them, 7 patients with EGFR C797 S or/and MET amplification received subsequent second-line targeted therapy, achieving mPFS of 7.3 months (95% CI 4.5 months -NA). Of note, 3 patients received immunotherapy as second- or third-line treatment after osimertinib resistance, achieving median clinical benefit of 37.3 months. MET amplification and C797S mutation are main resistance mechanisms, which could be targeted by crizotinib and gefitinib, respectively. More than 50% patients could receive subsequent anticancer targetable therapies after first-line osimertinib resistance. Immunotherapy may also be an acceptable choice after osimertinib resistance.",

The most frequent alterations in EGFR are short in-frame deletions in exon 19 (Del19) and the missense mutation L858R, which both lead to increased activity and sensitization of NSCLC to EGFR inhibition. The first approved EGFR inhibitors used for first-line treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib and erlotinib, are quinazoline-based. However, both inhibitors have several known off-targets, and they also potently inhibit wild-type (WT) EGFR, resulting in side effects.

Our study was to explore the adverse events (AEs) caused by osimertinib through data mining of the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and provide reference for clinical safety. Data of osimertinib were collected from the FAERS database covering the period from first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2021. Disproportionality analyses was employed to quantify the associated AE signals of osimertinib and detect the risk signals from the data in the FAERS database. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the FAERS database. The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Totally, 9,704,33 reports were collected from the FAERS database, 10,804 reports of osimertinib were identified as the 'primary suspected (PS)' AEs. Osimertinib induced AEs occurred in 27 organ systems. 68 significant disproportionality PTs satisfying with the four algorithms were retained at the same time. Unexpected significant AEs such as scrotal volvulus, hepatic function abnormal, venous thromboembolisms might also occur. The median onset time of osimertinib-associated AEs was 58\u00a0days (interquartile range [IQR] 14-212\u00a0days), and the majority of the AEs occurred within the first 30\u00a0days after osimertinib initiation.

    "abstract": "Co-occurring genomic alterations identified downstream main oncogenic drivers have become more evident since the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses at diagnosis and progression. Emerging evidence has stated that co-occurring genomic alterations at diagnosis might represent de novo and primary resistance mechanisms to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced EGFR-mutant (EGFRm) non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we assessed the prognostic role of co-occurring genomic alterations in advanced EGFRm NSCLC. A cohort of 111 patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations detected by PCR was analyzed in 5 Latin American oncological centers from January 2019 to December 2020. All eligible patients received upfront therapy with EGFR-TKI. Co-occurring genomic alterations were determined at diagnosis in every patient by the NGS (FoundationOneCDx) comprehensive platform, which evaluates 324 known cancer-related genes. EGFR exon19 deletion was the most frequent oncogenic driver mutation (60.4\u00a0%) detected by NGS. According to the NGS assay, 31\u00a0% and 68.3\u00a0% of patients had 1-2 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 co-occurring genomic alterations, respectively. The most frequent co-occurring genomic alterations were TP53 mutations (64.9\u00a0%) followed by CDKN2AB alterations (13.6\u00a0%), BRCA2 (13.6\u00a0%), and PTEN (12.7\u00a0%) mutations. Baseline central nervous system disease was present in 42.7\u00a0% of patients. First- or second-generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, afatinib, or erlotinib) were the most common treatment in 67.5\u00a0% of patients, while osimertinib was administered in 27.9\u00a0% of cases. The median PFS in all evaluated patients was 13.63\u00a0months (95\u00a0%CI: 11.79-15.52). Using\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 co-occurring alterations as the cut-off point, patients with\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 co-occurring genomic alterations showed a median PFS, of 12.7\u00a0months (95\u00a0%CI: 9.92-15.5) vs 21.3\u00a0months (95\u00a0%CI: 13.93-NR) in patients with 2 or less co-occurring genomic alterations [HR 3.06, (95\u00a0%CI: 1.55-5.48) p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001]. Also, patients with a TP53 mutation had a shorter PFS, 13.6 (95\u00a0%CI: 10.7-15.5) vs 19.2\u00a0months (95\u00a0%CI: 12.8-NR); in wild type TP53 [HR 2.01 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.18-3.74) p\u00a0=\u00a00.12]. In the multivariate analysis, the number (\u22653) of concurrent genomic alterations and ECOG PS of 2 or more were related to a significant risk factor for progression [HR 2.79 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.49-5.23) p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and HR 2.42 (95\u00a0%CI: 1.22-4.80) p\u00a0=\u00a00.011 respectively]. EGFR-mutant NSCLC is not a single oncogene-driven disease in the majority of cases, harboring a higher number of co-occurring genomic alterations. This study finds the number of co-occurring genomic alterations and the presence of TP53 mutations as negative prognostic biomarkers, which confers potentially earlier resistance mechanisms to target therapy.",

EGFR mutation testing was also approved in 2007. Although clinical trials showed efficacy in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations, these effects have rarely been reported in real-world practice. We evaluated changes in survival in NSCLC patients following introduction of these agents and EGFR mutation testing by extracting patients diagnosed with NSCLC from 1993 through 2011 from six prefectural population-based cancer registries in Japan. Relative survival (RS) was calculated by sex, histological subtype, and cancer stage. We conducted interrupted time series analysis to assess survival changes following introduction of EGFR-TKIs and EGFR mutation testing. 120,068 patients with NSCLC were analyzed. One- and three-year RS gradually increased in overall NSCLC for men and women. For adenocarcinoma, among men, slopes of 1- and 3-year RS increased steeply in patients diagnosed from 2007 through 2011; among women, significant level increases were seen in 1-year RS in patients diagnosed in 2002 (4.55% [95% confidence interval: 1.76-7.33]) and 2007 (3.40% [1.27-5.52]). These significant level increases were particularly obvious in women with adenocarcinoma at an advanced stage. Our results suggest that recent improvements in survival in men and women with adenocarcinoma are due at least partly to introduction of EGFR-TKIs into real-world practice, and to prescription based on appropriate patient selection following introduction of EGFR mutation testing into real-world practice in Japan.",

Using healthcare administrative data, three cohorts were created to describe the use of three EGFR-TKIs that are publicly funded in Quebec for specific indications (i.e., 1st-line gefitinib, 1st-line afatinib, and post-EGFR-TKI osimertinib). The main objective was to compare overall survival (OS) among patients receiving these treatments to those in previous experimental and real-world studies. The patients who received EGFR-TKIs for indications of interest between 1 April 2001, and 31 March 2019 (or 31 March 2020, for post-EGFR-TKI osimertinib) were included to estimate the Kaplan-Meier-based median OS for each cohort. An extensive literature search was conducted to include comparable studies. For the gefitinib 1st-line (n = 457), the afatinib 1st-line (n = 80), and the post-EGFR-TKI osimertinib (n = 119) cohorts, we found a median OS (in months) of 18.9 (95%CI: 16.3-21.9), 26.6 (95%CI: 13.7-NE) and 19.9 (95%CI: 17.4-NE), respectively.

Liposome-contained magnetic microspheres coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by microemulsion, and the surface was modified with EGFR antibody to form EGFR/EpCAM multi-site liposome-contained immunomagnetic microspheres (IMMSs). The CTCs were isolated and identified from peripheral blood samples and the cell lines of lung cancer patients collected by the multi-site liposome-contained IMMSs. To investigate the effects of the order of use of IMMSs sequence at different sites on the sorting and trapping efficiency of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells . The preliminary verification of drug-resistant gene function and dynamic monitoring of CTCs in 20 patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC were screened and statistically analyzed before and after osimertinib treatment. Sensitivity analysis and drug resistance evaluation of oxitidine were detected in vitro. Results showed the prepared multi-site liposome-contained IMMSs had high stability and specificity. The number of CTCs in blood samples of the patients with NSCLC was detected, revealing high sorting efficiency, and positive sorting rate reaching more than 90%. We investigated the effect of osimertinib on the HER-2 expression on the EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells and found that osimertinib increased the expression of HER-2 on the cell surface of NSCLC cell lines., And further explored the therapeutic potential of osimertinib combined with T-DM1 at different dosing times. Our results demonstrate that the prepared multi-site liposome-contained IMMSs can efficiently isolate CTCs from the peripheral blood in lung cancer. Combined with the experimental data about osimertinib can be effectively identified, the resistant genes of NSCLC including EGFR, which will provide a new scientific basis for guiding clinical medication and formulating individualized treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "In clinical studies, first-line afatinib demonstrated efficacy in Del19-EGFR NSCLC. This prospective, non-interventional study assessed efficacy and safety of first-line afatinib in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with Del19-EGFR from Galicia (Spain), with a preplanned analysis by age (<70\u00a0vs \u226570 years). Median age of 46 patients enrolled was 69.5 years (range 37-87). The objective response rate (ORR) was 78.2%, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 20.5 months (95% CI 12.7, 28.3) and median overall survival (OS) of 37.5 months (95% CI 19.2-55.8). Outcomes by age (<70\u00a0vs \u226570 years) were ORR of 82.6% vs 73.9%, median PFS of 20.2 months (95% CI 14.8-25.6) vs 24.1 (9.8-38.3), and median OS of 45.1 months (95% CI, 17.0-73.1) vs 33.9 (28.7-39.1), respectively. Median treatment duration was 17.2 months (range 0.4-64.1) with 11 patients still on treatment; 14 patients received osimertinib at discontinuation due to T790M. Grade 3 adverse events included mucositis (n\u00a0=\u00a07, 15.2%), skin toxicity (n\u00a0=\u00a09, 19.6%), and diarrhea (n\u00a0=\u00a06, 13.0%) that were manageable with dose reductions. The afatinib dose was reduced in 31 patients (67.4%) and treatment was discontinued in 8 patients (17.4%) due to adverse events. By age (<70\u00a0vs \u226570 years), afatinib was dose-reduced in 13 (56.5%) vs 18 patients (78.3%) and discontinued in 3 (13.0%) vs 5 patients (21.7%), respectively. PFS in our patients was longer than reported in clinical studies with similar response rates and toxicity, even in older patients, reflecting a good risk-benefit from afatinib in patients with Del19-EGFR NSCLC. This real-world study of first-line afatinib in Caucasian patients with Del19 EGFR NSCLC reported durable efficacy and showed that older patients (>\u00a070 years) benefitted from afatinib as much as younger patients. The safety profile of afatinib was as expected, albeit more dose reductions in older patients. Afatinib may be an option for patients with Del19 EGFR NSCLC, even in those who are older.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are well-known genetic alterations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which are associated with remarkable survival benefits from first-line treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, around 30% of patients exhibit primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs therapy. Co-existing MET amplification/over-expression has showed shorter time to progression on EGFR-TKI monotherapy. Osimertinib (TAGRISSO, AZD9291) has been recommended in EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients as first-line treatment. Savolitinib (AZD6094, HMPL-504) is a highly selective MET-TKI which has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in various cancers with MET alterations. This FLOWERS study, a phase II, randomized, open-label, 2-cohort multicenter trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib with or without savolitinib as first-line therapy in patients with de novo MET amplified/over-expressed, EGFR-mutant positive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Approximately 44 patients will be randomized to receive osimertinib (80 mg once daily) monotherapy or osimertinib (80 mg once daily) and savolitinib (300 mg twice daily) combination therapy; patients in osimertinib monotherapy cohort confirmed as MET positive (MET-amplified/over-expressed) after disease progression will have the opportunity to receive the cross-over combination therapy as second-line treatment. Primary endpoint will be objective response rate. Key secondary endpoints will be progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate, overall survival, safety and tolerability. The results of the study will provide better perspectives on the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI plus MET-TKI combination therapy (osimertinib plus savolitinib) in patients with de novo MET-amplified/over-expressed, EGFR-mutant positive, treatment na\u00efve, advanced NSCLC and offer a meaningful guidance in clinical practice (NCT05163249).",

    "abstract": "A recently overall survival (OS) analysis from the AURA3 trial indicated that osimertinib improves median OS versus platinum-pemetrexed for patients with previously treated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of second-line osimertinib versus platinum-pemetrexed, from the perspectives of the United States payer and the Chinese health care system. A Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and health outcomes of osimertinib versus platinum-pemetrexed in second-line treatment of EGFR T790M advanced NSCLC. Life years (LYs), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the model. Cost-effectiveness was examined in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and central nervous system (CNS) metastases population. In the United States, compared with platinum-pemetrexed, osimertinib yielded additional effectiveness of 0.43 QALYs and -0.12 QALYs, with incremental costs of $67,588 and $16,465 in the ITT population and CNS metastases population, respectively. The ICERs of osimertinib over platinum-pemetrexed were $159,126/QALY and $-130,830/QALY, respectively. The probability of osimertinib being cost-effective was 37% and 5.76%, respectively, at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY. In China, osimertinib showed incremental effectiveness of 0.34 QALYs and -0.14 QALYs, with incremental costs of $1,663 and $-505, resulting in ICERs of $4,950/QALY and $3,754/QALY in the ITT population and CNS metastases population, respectively. At the WTP threshold of $37,489/QALY, there was a 100% and 26% likelihood that osimertinib was cost-effective in the ITT population and CNS metastases population. In the United States, second-line osimertinib treatment for EGFR T790M advanced NSCLC is not cost-effective compared to platinum-pemetrexed under the current WTP threshold. When the osimertinib price reduces, the economic outcome may become favorable. In China, assuming a WTP threshold of $37,489/QALY, osimertinib is the dominant treatment strategy compared with platinum-pemetrexed in the ITT population and provides cost savings for CNS metastases patients.",

    "abstract": "Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a serious complication of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in patients with EGFR mutations. In this study, we investigated the survival outcomes of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who have developed LM and explored the factors associated with their survival. From April 2018 to November 2021, patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling under the clinical suspicion of LM were enrolled. The patients' clinicodemographic characteristics, treatment history including whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), overall survival (OS), and intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS) were measured. EGFR mutations in cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) of CSF, including T790M mutation, were analyzed. We enrolled 62 patients with NSCLC. The median time form diagnosis to LM was 23.1\u00a0months and 16 (25.8%) patients had history of prior third-generation EGFR-TKI use. EGFR mutation in CSF ctDNA was detected in 53 patients (85.5%); of them, 10 (16.1%) had T790M mutation. The patients' icPFS and OS after osimertinib were 6.43 and 9.37\u00a0months, respectively, and were comparable among patients with different sensitive EGFR mutations, indicating that EGFR mutation status did not affect osimertinib efficacy. Patients who received WBRT after LM had numerically higher icPFS and OS compared to those without. Multivariate analysis revealed that lack of prior exposure to third-generation EGFR-TKI was associated with better OS. Osimertinib is effective in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who developed LM and prior third-generation EGFR-TKI use was associated with poor survival in these patients. The role of WBRT warrants further investigation.",

Osimertinib is an effective therapy for NSCLC patients with acquired resistance due to T790M mutation after first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI treatment. This study aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes of sequential therapy following first-line EGFR-TKIs and the predictive factors of an acquired T790M mutation. Between January 2014 and December 2018, data from 2190 advanced NSCLC patients with common EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R) receiving first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs in Linkou, Kaohsiung, Chiayi and Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals were retrospectively retrieved and analyzed. Until August 2021, among 1943 patients who experienced progressive disease, 526 underwent T790M mutation tests, and their T790M-positive rate was 53.6%. Exon 19 deletion mutation and progression-free survival (PFS) of >12\u2009months were positively associated with secondary T790M mutation. Different first-line first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI therapies did not affect the appearance of acquired T790M mutations. The median overall survival (OS) was 58.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 49.0-67.5] months among the patients with T790M mutation who received second-line osimertinib therapy compared with 31.0 (95% CI: 27.5-34.5) months among the patients without T790M mutation who received chemotherapy alone. The multivariate analysis showed that a poor performance status (score: >2), nonadenocarcinoma histology, stage IV cancer, liver metastasis, brain metastasis, PFS while on first-line EGFR-TKIs, and subsequent chemotherapy without third-generation EGFR-TKIs were significant independent unfavorable prognostic factors for OS. This study demonstrated the efficacy of first-line EGFR-TKIs and sequential osimertinib therapy. The results of our study suggest that T790M mutation tests are important for the use of subsequent osimertinib, which yielded favorable survival outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) designed to overcome acquired T790M resistance mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the efficacy of osimertinib in patients without acquired T790M mutations has not been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib in patients treated with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs followed by later-line osimertinib treatment. Patients: The clinical data and survival outcomes of 172 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with osimertinib following frontline EGFR-TKIs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. T790M mutations were detected using tissue sequencing and/or liquid biopsy. Results: A total of 172 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with frontline EGFR-TKI therapy followed by later-line osimertinib were enrolled in the current study and divided into three groups based on the T790M status (positive, negative, or unknown T790M). Patients with NSCLC harboring acquired T790M mutation treated with osimertinib had the best objective response rate (ORR) (52.6%, 25.0%, and 32.0%, p = 0.044), disease control rate (DCR) (79.3%, 41.7%, and 68.0%, p = 0.011), and progression-free survival (PFS, median PFS, 12.6, 3.1, 10.4 months, p = 0.001) among the three groups (positive, negative, and unknown T790M, respectively). However, a marked difference was found between positive and negative T790M mutations but not between positive and unknown T790M mutations. Univariate analysis was performed to identify potential prognostic factors for PFS in 172 patients treated with osimertinib. Lung metastasis (p < 0.001), brain metastasis (p < 0.009), number of metastatic sites (p < 0.001), PFS with frontline EGFR-TKIs (p = 0.03), and T790M status (p = 0.006) were identified as prognostic factors for PFS with osimertinib. Multivariate analysis showed that lung metastasis (p < 0.001) and PFS with frontline EGFR-TKIs and T790M status were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: This study confirmed the greater efficacy of later-line osimertinib for NSCLC with acquired T790M mutation than for NSCLC without acquired T790M mutation. Detection of the T790M mutation after frontline treatment (first- and second-generation EGFR-TKI) is crucial for prolonging the survival of NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation. Osimertinib may be considered an option for NSCLC with unknown T790M mutations, as a certain subpopulation may benefit from osimertinib.",

    "title": "The Anticancer Effect of Metformin Combined with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients with or Without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Despite the growing evidence for the anticancer effect of metformin or its combination with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the efficacies and side effects of such strategies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not well understood. This meta-analysis was performed to determine the efficacy and side effects of metformin combined with EGFR-TKIs (MET-EGFR-TKIs) for the treatment of NSCLC with or without T2DM. PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were used to retrieve relevant studies through August 2020 using the keywords \"metformin\", \"EGFR-TKIs\" (\"gefitinib\" or \"erlotinib\" or \"afatinib\" or \"icotinib\" or \"dacomitinib\") and \"lung cancer\". The patients in the experimental group received MET-EGFR-TKIs, while those in the control group received only EGFR-TKIs. The outcome analysis reported overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). Random-effect models and fixed-effect models were used to estimate the combined hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) depending on the data heterogeneity. Three studies (including 1996 patients) were included in the current meta-analysis. There were significant differences in PFS (HR 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.95; P\u2009=\u20090.004) and OS (HR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.50-1.04; P\u2009<\u20090.001) between the MET-EGFR-TKI and EGFR-TKI groups. Although the ORR (OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.66-2.88; P\u2009=\u20090.105) and DCR (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.68-9.95, P\u2009=\u20090.160) were improved, there was no statistical significance. OS subgroup analysis showed that the combination was more effective in NSCLC with T2DM than in NSCLC without T2DM (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.95; P\u2009<\u20090.005). MET-EGFR-TKIs provided benefits for PFS and OS, and OS subgroup analysis showed that patients with NSCLC with T2DM received greater benefit than NSCLC patients without T2DM. However, further large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted to confirm the findings in the present investigation.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib, as the first third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been recommended universally as the priority front-line therapeutic for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying EGFR-sensitive mutations. However, patients inevitably acquire drug resistance to osimertinib. Aumolertinib is the second third-generation EGFR-TKI and has been similarly approved as a first-line treatment agent. The present study reports the cases of 3 patients who were challenged with aumolertinib after osimertinib failure. All 3 patients achieved a partial remission. The progression-free survival periods following aumolertinib were 10.0, 11 and 9.0 months (at the time of writing the study). Although the patient in case 2 succumbed to an intracerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension, aumolertinib remained effective as a treatment in cases 1 and 3. The present case series suggests the use of aumolertinib challenge as an optional treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR-sensitive mutations after osimertinib failure. The therapeutic strategy of switching from osimertinib to aumolertinib is worth exploring further in the near future.",

PubMed, the Web of Science, Medline, and reports of the top three world cancer conferences (WCLC, ESMO, and ASCO) were searched for appropriated randomized controlled studies (RCTs) discussing the use of various generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, osimertinib, aumolertinib), chemotherapy [pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (PC), non-pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (NPC)], and different combined therapies (osimertinib plus bevacizumab, afatinib plus cetuximab, erlotinib plus bevacizumab, erlotinib plus ramucirumab, gefitinib plus apatinib, gefitinib plus PC, and gefitinib plus pemetrexed) to treat patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR Leu858Arg or 19del mutations. OpenBugs and Stata software were used to analyze the data. We included 21 studies with 16 arms (including 2479 cases with EGFR Leu858Arg mutations and 3325 cases with EGFR 19del mutations).

Over the past decade, the management of NSCLC-carrying EGFR mutation has evolved considerably with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The main objective of this retrospective study was to analyze the evolution of therapeutic strategies in a cohort of patients with metastatic or locally advanced EGFR- mutated NSCLC. Data on patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, eligible for TKIs, and treated between 2010 to 2019 were collected. The main therapeutic strategies adopted following progression under TKIs and the prognostic factors for survival were analyzed. The median age of the 177 patients was included in the cohort was 70years. The majority of patients (77.4%) received TKIs as first-line treatment, while 16.4% received chemotherapy. Osimertinib initiation as second-line treatment was a factor for better prognosis (OR=0.5). Finally, change of chemotherapy line was the main therapeutic strategy adopted for 41.3% of the patients having relapsed under TKIs. Therapeutic management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients was in accordance with regional, national and international recommendations. The characterization of progression under TKI therapy has become systematic, allowing better adaption of therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The development of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has brought favorable survival benefits to patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); unfortunately, acquired drug resistance remains a major barrier to the treatment of NSCLC. Recent studies have demonstrated that the transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR1) induces tumor immune evasion by directly modulating the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy. Moreover, aberrant activation of TAZ is also a major mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. Therefore, TAZ signaling blockade might be an effective strategy to overcome resistance to ICIs and EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. In this study, we showed for the \ufb01rst time that artesunate effectively reduced TAZ and PD-L1 expression in NSCLC. We further demonstrated that artesunate suppressed TAZ/PD-L1-induced T-cell growth inhibition in vitro and enhanced anti-tumor immunity by recruiting infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T-cells in syngeneic mouse models. Artesunate also inhibited the stem cell-like properties of NSCLC cells and suppressed tumor growth in xenografts bearing gefitinib-resistant tumors. In addition, our results of molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay analysis suggested that artesunate might directly target the TAZ-TEAD complex and induce proteasome-dependent TAZ degradation in NSCLC cells. These results suggest that artesunate enhanced anti-tumor immunity and overcame EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC at least in part by suppressing TAZ/PD-L1 signaling.",

However, durable response is invariably limited by the emergence of acquired resistance. Here, we investigated the preclinical activity of REGN5093-M114, a novel antibody-drug conjugate targeting MET in MET-driven patient-derived models. Patient-derived organoids, patient-derived cells, or ATCC cell lines were used to investigate the in vitro/in vivo activity of REGN5093-M114. REGN5093-M114 exhibited significant antitumor efficacy compared with MET TKI or unconjugated METxMET biparatopic antibody (REGN5093). Regardless of MET gene copy number, MET-overexpressed TKI-na\u00efve EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells responded to REGN5093-M114 treatment. Cell surface MET expression had the most predictive power in determining the efficacy of REGN5093-M114. REGN5093-M114 potently reduced tumor growth of EGFR-mutant NSCLC with PTEN loss or MET Y1230C mutation after progression on prior osimertinib and savolitinib treatment. Altogether, REGN5093-M114 is a promising candidate to overcome the challenges facing functional MET pathway blockade.",

We present the final phase Ib TATTON (NCT02143466) analysis (Part B, n = 138/Part D, n = 42) assessing oral savolitinib 600 mg/300 mg once daily (q.d.) + osimertinib 80 mg q.d. in patients with MET-amplified, EGFR-mutated (EGFRm) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and progression on prior EGFR-TKI. An acceptable safety profile was observed. In Parts B and D, respectively, objective response rates were 33% to 67% and 62%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 to 11.1 months and 9.0 months. Increased antitumor activity may occur with MET copy number \u226510. EGFRm circulating tumor DNA clearance on treatment predicted longer PFS in patients with detectable baseline ctDNA, while acquired resistance mechanisms to osimertinib + savolitinib were mediated by MET, EGFR, or KRAS alterations. The savolitinib + osimertinib combination represents a promising therapy in patients with MET-amplified/overexpressed, EGFRm advanced NSCLC with disease progression on a prior EGFR-TKI. Acquired resistance mechanisms to this combination include those via MET, EGFR, and KRAS.

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance to osimertinib is inevitable and heterogeneous despite its documented efficacy against EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subsequent therapeutic options assume the dominant form of the resistance mechanism; however, the more rare oncogenic driver, NTRK1 fusion, has also reportedly conferred osimertinib resistance. Nevertheless, clear-cut options when NSCLCs are driven by EGFR mutation and the subsequent NTRK fusion are lacking. This is a case of NSCLC wherein exon 19 deletion in EGFR (19del) and acquired LMNA-NTRK1 fusion were accompanied by the persistence of EGFR T790M. The patient underwent peritoneal metastasis after multiple targeted therapies: gefitinib, osimertinib, chemotherapy, and anlotinib plus docetaxel (in clinical trials). Osimertinib was subsequently re-administered with the NTRK fusion inhibitor entrectinib, resulting in remission of peritoneal metastases even after slow progression of pancreatic metastasis over the following 5\u2009months. An extensive literature review to identify the efficacies of therapies for NTRK fusion as the means to acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs revealed that blocking both the EGFR mutation and the subsequent NTRK fusion can provide clinical benefits following EGFR TKIs resistance; however, the efficacy and safety of combination therapies must be further investigated. To precisely manage EGFR-mutated NSCLCs, it is also essential to identify the resistance mechanisms by repeating biopsies.",

    "abstract": "Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody that recognizes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET proto-oncogene (MET). In May 2021, the Food and Drug Administration gave an accelerated approval of amivantamab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions (Exon20ins) who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Amivantamab prevents ligand binding to EGFR and MET and the dimerization of the receptors suppressing the downstream signal transduction. Moreover, amivantamab determines antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and down regulation of cell surface proteins through internalization of the receptor and trogocytosis. Preliminary results of the Phase I/IB CHRYSALIS trial demonstrated an objective response rate of 40% with a median duration of response of 11.1 months (95% CI 9.6-not reached) in 81 patients treated with amivantamab with pretreated NSCLC with Exon20ins EGFR mutations. In a different cohort of the CHRYSALIS trial, patients with Ex19del and L858R EGFR mutations were enrolled after progression on osimertinib. 121 and 45 patients received amivantamab or a combination with lazertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, respectively. The objective response rate was 19% and 36% in patients treated with amivantamab alone or in combination with lazertinib, with a median progression-free survival of 6.9 (95% CI: 3.2-5.3) and 11.1 (95% CI: 3.7-9.5) months, respectively. All 20 patients with Ex19del and L858R EGFR mutations who received amivantamab and lazertinib as their first line treatment achieved an objective response. Amivantamab is currently under evaluation in Phase III clinical trials for the first line treatment of NSCLCs with Exon20ins EGFR mutations in combination with chemotherapy (PAPILLON), for the first line therapy of Ex19del and L858R mutated NSCLCs in combination with lazertinib (MARIPOSA) and in combination with chemotherapy and lazertinib in NSCLCs who progressed on osimertinib (MARIPOSA-2).",

    "abstract": "According to global cancer data, lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer-related death in 2020. With the diversification of treatment strategies, the survival outcomes of patients with advanced lung cancer have improved significantly, but the 5-year overall survival rate remains <20%. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are the preferred treatment for lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations; however, acquired drug resistance is inevitable. Osimertinib (a third-generation EGFR inhibitor) is the most commonly used drug for cancers with a secondary T790M mutation. Unfortunately, acquired drug resistance against third-generation drugs still emerges. The C797s mutation is the primary acquired resistance mechanism against Osimertinib. Research on fourth-generation EGFR-TKI drugs with a C797s mutation is currently at various experimental stages, and no drug has been approved for clinical use. In addition to the resistance mechanisms described above, HER2 amplification, MET amplification, PIK3A mutation, KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation, transformation to small cell lung cancer, transformation to lung squamous cell carcinoma, and EMT have been reported as mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to first-, second- and third-generation EGFR-TKIs. These mechanisms are noted in a relatively high proportion of tumors, but treatment options are limited. In recent years, immunotherapy has made progress in the treatment of several cancers, including advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to the relatively high frequency of EGFR mutation in patients with lung adenocarcinoma in China, an increased number of patients develop EGFR-TKI resistance, and subsequent treatment options are critical. This article reviews the mechanisms of drug resistance to different EGFR-TKIs and treatment progression, providing ideas for the follow-up treatment for EGFR-resistant patients.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is the current standard-of-care for the first-line treatment of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Progression after osimertinib ineluctably occurs, and standard of care treatment options beyond progression have mainly included next-line platinum doublet chemotherapy. With better understanding of the varied molecular mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib, several opportunities for the use of targeted agents are emerging that include MET amplification, observed in 15% of patients, and resistant EGFR mutations, including C797S in 7% of patients. Evidence for the use of targeted therapies in such situations is mostly based on case reports, but clinical trials are being conducted with MET inhibitors, such as amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, or next-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as patritumab-deruxtecan, a HER3 antibody drug conjugate. In this review, we outline our proposed approach to current clinical practice for patients with EGFR mutant, osimertinib-resistant NSCLC which includes the following potential strategies: - Continuation of osimertinib beyond progression following local ablative treatment of oligoprogressive disease, - Tissue rebiopsy of progressive site and possibly concurrent liquid biopsy to evaluate for mechanism of resistance utilizing comprehensive genomic profiling, -Discussion at a molecular tumor board for assessment for enrollment in clinical trials/expanded access program if available with innovative drugs or possible off-label use of available targeted agents, based on the results of molecular profiling, -If no mechanism of resistance identified, administration of platinum-based chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agents. The role of immunotherapy will also be addressed given the uncertain benefit.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a recently approved third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR-T790M resistance mutations. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy and safety of osimertinib for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Databases were searched for randomized controlled studies that reported the efficacy and safety of osimertinib versus other treatments (chemotherapy, other EGFR-TKIs, etc.) in treating EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The measured effects included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), central nervous system progression-free survival (CNS-PFS), and overall survival (OS). Additional outcome was the incidence of adverse event. Relative risk (RR) for incidence and hazard ratio (HR) for survival outcomes were pooled. Seven studies containing 3335 participants were finally included. Osimertinib tended to improve ORR and DCR (RRs >1) as compared with other treatments. Osimertinib was also a significant protective factor for PFS, CNS-PFS, and OS (HRs <1 and  This meta-analysis suggests that osimertinib has a positive effect in disease control and survival for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with acceptable toxicities.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance is a challenge in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we examined the effect of Fasudil in reversing TKIs resistance. The results of CCK8 assay, clone formation assay, cell cycle arrest analysis, and apoptosis analysis show that Fasudil treatment effectively suppressed the growth and induced apoptosis of the EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Fasudil in combination with gefitinib showed a synergistic anti-tumor effect in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. RNA-seq analysis and immunoblotting indicated that Fasudil treatment significantly inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation and EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Mechanistic investigations showed that Fasudil regulated lipogenic gene expressions via AMPK signal pathway. In vivo, Fasudil and gefitinib co-administration significantly attenuated the growth of H1975 nude mouse xenograft models, suggesting that Fasudil treatment combined with gefitinib can be applied as a therapy for gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells.",

    "abstract": "Although osimertinib has excellent intracranial activity in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with exon 19 deletion or L858R EGFR alterations, measures of local control of brain metastases are less well-reported. We describe lesion-level outcomes of brain metastases treated with osimertinib alone. We retrospectively reviewed patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with untreated brain metastasis measuring\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0mm at the time of initiating osimertinib. Cumulative incidence of local recurrence in brain (LRiB) was calculated with death as a competing risk, and univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with LRiB. We included 284 brain metastases from 37 patients. Median follow-up was 20.1\u00a0months. On initial MRI after starting osimertinib, patient-level response was complete response (CR) in 11 (15%), partial response (PR) in 33 (45%), stable disease (SD) in 18 (25%) and progressive disease (PD) in 11 (15%). The 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB was 14% (95% CI 9.9-17.9) and was significantly different in patients with a CR (0%), PR (4%), and SD (11%; p\u2009=\u20090.02). Uncontrolled primary tumor (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.78, 95% CI 1.87-7.66; p\u2009<\u20090.001), increasing number of prior systemic therapies (aHR 2.12, 95% CI 1.49-3.04; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher ECOG score (aHR 7.8, 95% CI 1.99-31.81; p\u2009=\u20090.003) were associated with LRiB. Although 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB is\u2009<\u20094% with a CR or PR, 1-year cumulative incidence of LRiB is over 10% for patients with less than a PR to osimertinib on initial MRI.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy is the standard of care in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, whether adding pemetrexed-based chemotherapy to EGFR-TKI targeted therapy furtherly prolongs survival outcomes and improves responses remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted this pooled analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability between gefitinib plus pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and gefitinib alone in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL on June 23, 2022. Eligible studies were registered randomized clinical trials comparing gefitinib plus pemetrexed-based chemotherapy with gefitinib alone. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and discontinuation rate (DR) were explored as secondary outcomes. Eight studies within five randomized clinical trials were eligible. Gefitinib combined with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy significantly prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89, p = 0.0125) and PFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.70, p < 0.0001) versus gefitinib alone. In subgroup analysis, patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R could benefit from the addition of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy to gefitinib in terms of PFS (EGFR exon 19 deletion: HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.75, p = 0.0008; EGFR exon 21 L858R: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.82, p = 0.0079) but not OS. In addition, ORR was improved after the administration of gefitinib plus pemetrexed-based chemotherapy against gefitinib (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% CI 1.44-2.55, p < 0.0001). Both strategies showed comparable DCRs (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.94-2.26, p = 0.0952) and DRs (risk ratio [RR] 2.80, 95% CI 0.69-11.44, p = 0.1509). Compared with gefitinib alone, combining pemetrexed-based chemotherapy with gefitinib significantly improved OS and PFS in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with acceptable tolerability. However, the accurate sub-population who could have OS benefits requires further validation.",

ECD mutations of EGFR in NSCLC may affect its normal function and intrinsic resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)\u00a0and the effectiveness of drugs for these patients is unsatisfactory. Recently, we found an EGFR T263P mutation located at the ECD, which has never been reported in Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hence, we reported that a patient with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring the EGFR T263P mutation, L858R mutation and MET amplification was resistant to osimertinib but significantly benefited from erlotinib and capmatinib treatment. This patient achieved a partial response and had progression-free survival (PFS) for more than 19 months. In summary, we are the first researchers to report in detail on a Chinese patient carrying the T263P mutation and summarize all the ECD mutations in NSCLC. We believe this finding will enlighten us to treat patients with EGFR ECD mutations and more patients deserve further study.",

    "abstract": "Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutations and acquired drug-resistant mutation T790M. Despite promising treatment benefits of osimertinib in first- and second-line settings, drug resistance has been an inevitable clinical issue. The resistance to osimertinib is heterogeneous, which may involve EGFR-dependent and independent mechanisms as well as histological transformation from NSCLC to small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Current clinical studies of NSCLC were mainly focused on patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations or acquired T790M mutation or both. The treatments and drug-resistant mechanisms in patients with de-novo T790M mutation remain undefined. Herein, we reported the presence of the less common de-novo EGFR T790M mutation in a stage IV NSCLC patient. The patient received osimertinib as first-line treatment and achieved durable progression-free survival (PFS) for 24 months. After osimertinib resistance, tumor biopsy indicated histologic transformation from NSCLC to SCLC. Given persistent presence of de-novo T790M mutation, osimertinib was used in combination with etoposide and cisplatin as second-line treatment and the patient achieved partial response with PFS of 7 months. Our study suggested that NSCLC patients with de-novo T790M mutation could also benefit from osimertinib and the SCLC transformation may be a potential resistance mechanism that could be targeted through the combination of targeted therapy and chemotherapy.",

This has led to the rapid development of many generations of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, patients treated with third-generation TKIs (osimertinib, avitinib and rociletinib) targeting the EGFR T790M mutation have shown emerging resistances and relapses. Therefore, further molecular understanding of NSCLC mutations, bypass signalling, tumour microenvironment and the existence of cancer stem cells to overcome such resistances is warranted. This will pave the way for designing novel and effective chemotherapies to improve patients' overall survival. In this review, we provide an overview of the multifaceted mechanisms of resistance towards EGFR-TKIs, as well as the challenges and perspectives that should be addressed in strategising chemotherapeutic treatments to overcome the ever-evolving and adaptive nature of NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, the initial therapeutic interventions will have crucial impacts on their clinical outcomes. Drug tolerant factors reportedly have an impact on EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity. This prospective study investigated the impacts of drug tolerant-related protein expression in tumors based on the efficacy of osimertinib in the first-setting of EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC patients. A total of 92 patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or postoperative recurrent NSCLC were analyzed and treated with osimertinib at 14 institutions in Japan. AXL, p53, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in patient tumors was determined using immunohistochemistry. The AXL signaling pathway was investigated using a cell line-based assay and AXL-related gene expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. High levels of AXL and positive-p53 expression were detected in 26.1% and 53.3% of the pretreatment EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumors, respectively. High AXL expression levels were significantly associated with a shorter progression-free survival compared with low AXL expression levels, irrespective of the EGFR activating mutation status (p\u00a0=\u20090.026). Cell line-based assays indicated that the overexpression of AXL protein accelerated PD-L1 expression, which induced insensitivity to osimertinib. In the TCGA database, AXL RNA levels were positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in the lung adenocarcinoma cohort. The results show that high AXL expression levels in tumors impact clinical predictions when using osimertinib to treat EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. Trial Registration: UMIN000043942.",

    "abstract": "This Delphi panel study assessed the level of consensus between medical oncologists on the clinical management of patients with early-stage EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A modified two-round Delphi approach was used. A scientific committee comprised of medical oncologists developed an online questionnaire. Delphi panel experts rated their level of agreement with each questionnaire statement on a 9-point Likert scale. The questionnaire included 36 statements from 3 domains (clinical management of early-stage NSCLC: 15 statements; role of adjuvant therapy in early-stage NSCLC: 9 statements; and role of adjuvant therapy in early-stage NSCLC with sensitizing EGFR mutation: 12 statements). In round 1, consensus was reached for 24/36 statements (66.7%). Nine statements that did not achieve consensus after the first round were evaluated in round 2, and none of them reached consensus. Overall, 84.4% of the panelists agreed that EGFR mutation testing should be done after surgery. Consensus was not achieved on whether the implementation of EGFR mutation testing in resected early-stage NSCLC could limit the use of adjuvant osimertinib. The panelists recognized the rationale for the use of osimertinib in the adjuvant scenario (88%) and 72% agreed that it may change the treatment paradigm in stage IB-IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Consensus was not reached on the inconvenience of prolonged duration of osimertinib. This Delphi study provides valuable insights into relevant questions in the management of early-stage EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However, specific issues remain unresolved. The expert consensus emphasizes the role of adjuvant treatment with osimertinib in this scenario.",

    "abstract": "Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), used for the treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, studies proved that Gefitinib-induced cardiotoxicity through induction of oxidative stress leads to cardiac hypertrophy. The current study was conducted to understand the mechanisms underlying gefitinib-induced cardiac hypertrophy through studying the roles of angiotensin II (AngII), oxidative stress, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Male Wistar albino rats were treated with valsartan, gefitinib, or both for four weeks. Blood samples were collected for AngII and cardiac markers measurement, and hearts were harvested for histological study and biochemical analysis. Gefitinib caused histological changes in the cardiac tissues and increased levels of cardiac hypertrophy markers, AngII and its receptors. Blocking of AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) via valsartan protected hearts and normalized cardiac markers, AngII levels, and the expression of its receptors during gefitinib treatment. valsartan attenuated gefitinib-induced NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress leading to down-regulation of JNK/p38-MAPK pathway. Collectively, AT1R blockade adjusted AngII-induced NADPH oxidase and JNK/p38-MAPK leading to attenuation of gefitinib-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This study found a pivotal role of AngII/AT1R signaling in gefitinib-induced cardiac hypertrophy, which may provide novel approaches in the management of EGFRIs-induced cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer with activated epidermal growth factor receptor mutations are more likely to develop leptomeningeal (LM) metastasis than other types of lung cancers and have a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and effective treatment of leptomeningeal carcinoma can improve the prognosis. A 55-year-old female with a progressive headache and vomiting for one month was admitted to Peking University First Hospital. She was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma with osseous metastasis 10 months prior to admittance. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was detected by genomic examination, so she was first treated with gefitinib for 10 months before acquiring resistance. Cell-free cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulating tumor DNA detection by next-generation sequencing was conducted and indicated the EGFR-Thr790Met mutation, while biopsy and cytology from the patient's CSF and the first enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no positive findings. A month later, the enhanced MRI showed linear leptomeningeal enhancement, and the cytology and biochemical examination in CSF remained negative. Therefore, osimertinib (80 mg/d) was initiated as a second-line treatment, resulting in a good response within a month. This report suggests clinical benefit of osimertinib in LM patients with positive detection of the EGFR-Thr790Met mutation in CSF and proposes that the positive findings of CSF circulating tumor DNA as a liquid biopsy technology based on the detection of cancer-associated gene mutations may appear earlier than the imaging and CSF findings and may thus be helpful for therapy. Moreover, the routine screening of chest CT with the novel coronavirus may provide unexpected benefits.",

US sensitive siRNA-NBs were designed to inhibit the expression of PDLIM5 in gefitinib-resistant human NSCLC PC9GR cells in vitro. The expression of autophagy-related proteins (P62 and LC3-II/I) and autophagosomes in PC9GR cells after PDLIM5 gene silencing were explored. US-sensitive PDLIM5-targeted siRNA-NBs were effectively delivered into PC9GR cells, inhibiting PDLIM5 expression, increasing LC3-II/I and p62 expressions and increasing autophagosomes in PC9GR cells in vitro. Using UTMD, US-sensitive siRNA-NBs have the potential as an ideal delivery vector to mediate highly effective RNA interference for NSCLC cells. Furthermore, PDLIM5 plays a role in the autophagy-mediated resistance in gefitinib-resistant PC9GR cells.",

    "abstract": "The ADAURA trial demonstrated the benefit of adjuvant osimertinib among patients with resected, early-stage, epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To understand the potential population impact, it is critical to deduce the prevalence, management, and outcomes of this patient population in the real-world setting before use of adjuvant osimertinib. Using PALEOS (Pan-cAnadian Lung cancEr Observational Study) data (2012-2019), a retrospective, multi-center, observational cohort study was conducted among patients with early-stage (IB-IIIA) resected NSCLC who had not received neoadjuvant therapy. Study outcomes included EGFRm prevalence, treatment patterns, recurrence outcomes, and overall and disease-free survival (OS/DFS). Among patients undergoing reflexive EGFRm testing by a pathologist at time of diagnosis irrespective of disease stage (N\u00a0=\u00a0535), 23\u00a0% were EGFRm-positive; 15.9\u00a0% had common mutations and 5.6\u00a0% had uncommon mutations. Within the EGFRm-positive cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a0156), mean age at diagnosis was 68\u00a0years, 65\u00a0% of patients were female, and 35\u00a0% were of Asian descent. At diagnosis, 48\u00a0%, 31\u00a0%, and 21\u00a0% had stage IB, II, or IIIA disease, respectively; 46\u00a0% received adjuvant therapy after resection. Half of patients experienced disease recurrence, typically involving distant sites; central nervous system metastasis varied from 12\u00a0% to 15.0\u00a0% across disease stages. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors were the most commonly received therapy after first metastatic recurrence. Median OS (DFS) was not reached, 71.2 (22.8) months, and 50.1 (18.0) months among stage IB, II, and IIIA patients. Patients with uncommon EGFRm had a lower probability of survival than those with common EGFRm (2\u00a0years: 87\u00a0% vs 91\u00a0%-94\u00a0%; 4\u00a0years: 56\u00a0% vs 73\u00a0%-82\u00a0%). Approximately-one-quarter of patients with resected, early-stage NSCLC were EGFRm-positive in this study. These patients had high recurrence rates and suboptimal long-term survival after treatment with current therapies. New adjuvant treatments are warranted.",

EGFR-TKI re-administration efficacy may vary between patients with T790M loss and those with T790M persistent with re-biopsy after osimertinib treatment. Patients who received EGFR-TKI re-administration (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib) after osimertinib failure were identified from our database. T790M mutation status before EGFR-TKI re-administration was analyzed via repeat biopsy. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of EGFR-TKI re-administration, especially differences according to the T790M mutation status, via repeat biopsy. Until June 2020, 28 patients received EGFR-TKI re-administration and 17 underwent repeat biopsy after osimertinib failure. Patients were divided into three groups, including the T790M loss group, where active mutation persisted and T790M was lost (13/17); T790M remaining group, where both the active mutation and T790M persisted (3/17); and active mutation loss group where both the active mutation and T790M were lost (1/17). The overall response rate (ORR) of EGFR-TKI re-administration in the T790M loss group was 31% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 54%, which were higher than the ORR of 21% and DCR of 43% in the entire patient population. ORR and DCR of the not re-biopsy group were low (9% and 27%, respectively). The therapeutic effect of EGFR-TKI re-administration in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC after osimertinib failure is limited. EGFR-TKI re-administration may be considered in cases of T790M loss after repeat biopsy.",

    "abstract": "High interindividual variability (IIV) of the clinical response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as osimertinib in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) might be related to the IIV in plasma exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure\u2212response relationship for toxicity and efficacy of osimertinib in unselected patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC. This retrospective analysis included 87 patients treated with osimertinib. Exposure\u2212toxicity analysis was performed in the entire cohort and survival analysis only in second-line patients (n = 45). No significant relationship between occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity and plasma exposure was observed in the entire cohort (p = 0.23, n = 86). The median overall survival (OS) was approximately two-fold shorter in the 4th quartile (Q4) of osimertinib trough plasma concentration (>235 ng/mL) than in the Q1\u2212Q3 group (12.2 months [CI95% = 8.0\u2212not reached (NR)] vs. 22.7 months [CI95% = 17.1\u221234.1]), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). To refine this result, the exposure\u2212survival relationship was explored in a cohort of 41 NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib. The Q4 erlotinib exposure group (>1728 ng/mL) exhibited a six-fold shorter median OS than the Q1\u2212Q3 group (4.8 months [CI95% = 3.3-NR] vs. 22.8 months (CI95% = 10.6\u221237.4), p = 0.00011).

    "title": "Histomolecular Resistance Mechanisms to First-Line Osimertinib in EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicentric Retrospective French Study.",
    "abstract": "Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in first line for the treatment of advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The identification of related histomolecular resistance mechanisms to first-line osimertinib is a critical step to define the optimal treatment strategy beyond progression. All consecutive patients treated in the first line with osimertinib for advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC at 10 hospitals in the Greater Paris area between April 2015 and January 2021 were included. Histomolecular data from plasma and tissue samples taken at progression under osimertinib were collected, and all samples were analyzed using DNA next-generation sequencing. Data on objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) were also collected. Overall, 104 patients were included. Most patients had adenocarcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0102, 98%) with an exon 19 EGFR deletion (n\u00a0=\u00a054, 52%). Forty-two patients (50%) had central nervous system (CNS) metastasis at the time of osimertinib initiation. ORR was 76%, median PFS and OS were 12.6 months and 52 months, respectively, and TTD was 33 months. At the time of analysis, 44 patients (42%) had tumor progression, and among these patients, 27 (61%) contributive samples were available. The most frequent molecular alterations at progression were mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) amplification (15%; n\u00a0=\u00a04) and EGFR C797S mutation (11%; n\u00a0=\u00a03). Histological transformation was found in one patient (4%). RNA next-generation sequencing was performed in eight patients and showed a CCDC6-RET fusion in one patient (12%). We confirmed the efficacy of osimertinib in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. At progression, the most frequent histomolecular alterations were MET amplification and EGFR C797S mutation.",

    "title": "Influence of esomeprazole on the bioavailability of afatinib: A pharmacokinetic cross-over study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Afatinib is an oral small-molecule kinase inhibitor (SMKI) approved for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driver mutation. Although oral administration is convenient, most SMKIs experience pH-dependent solubility. A drug-drug interaction between afatinib and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) has, however, never been studied in humans. Hence, we performed a randomized, three-period cross-over study. Afatinib (30\u00a0mg or 40\u00a0mg) was administered without PPI (period A), concomitantly with esomeprazole (period B) and three hours after esomeprazole intake (period C). Primary objective was the area under the curve (AUC",
